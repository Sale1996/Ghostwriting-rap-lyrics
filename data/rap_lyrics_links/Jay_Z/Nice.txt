[Intro: Pharrell]
Mm-mm-hmm-mm-hmm, yeah

[Chorus: Beyonce + Pharrell]
(Woo) I can do anything, yeah
Hell nah, hell nah, hell nah, hell nah
(Woo) I can do anything, yeah
Hell nah, hell nah, hell nah, hell nah

[Chorus]

[JAY-Z]
Yeah, fuck your subpoenas and your misdemeanors
Was too busy tourin out all your arenas
My passport is tatted, it look like it's active
I play on these planes, y'all catch me in traffic
Y'all drag me in court for that shit, y'all backwards
After all of these years of drug traffickin, huh
Time to remind me I'm Black again, huh?
All this talkin back, I'm too arrogant, huh?
What would you do you knew you couldn't fail?
I have no fear of anything, do everything well
I have no fear of jail, I was born in the trap
I have no fear of death, we all born to do that
(Woo) It's just life
I'm just nice, tonight I might
raise my price, great advice
Damn you Hov', Jesus Christ~!

[Chorus]

[Interlude: JAY-Z + Beyonce] + (Pharrell)
And I'm nice, nice, nice, nice
Nice (yeah) nice (yeah) nice (yeah)
Up all night, night, night, night
Night (yeah) night (yeah) night (yeah)
Runnin from the lights, lights, lights, lights
Lights (yeah) lights (yeah) lights (yeah)
Covered in ice, ice, ice, ice
Ice (yeah) ice (yeah) ice (yeah, yeah)

[Beyonce]
Patiently waitin for my demise
Cause my success can't be quantified
If I gave two fucks, two fucks about streamin numbers
would have put "Lemonade" up on Spotify
Fuck you...
Fuck you...
You're cool...
Fuck you - I'm out (ahh!)
I ain't never seen a ceiling in my whole life (uh-uh)
That's word to Blue
Freestylin live (freestylin live)
+Blueprint+ from my Jigga who never writes
I'm so ni-i-ice
I'm e'rybody type (uh) goddamn right (hah)
I'm so nice (ah) Jesus Christ (rah)
I'm better than the hype (hah) I give you life (life!)

[Chorus]

[Interlude]

[Beyonce] + (Pharrell)
Last name gon' be here forever (yeah)
Now we finna float like feathers (yeah)
Me and Hova do it like rebels (yeah)
Most of y'all jits got pebbles (yeah)
I got the Rocs and the Fella (yeah)
Ice lightning bolts from the heavens (yeah)
Y'all gon' have to watch us eat, eat!

[Pharrell]
Stocked up like the Doomsday Preppers
Anybody ever had an era (yeah)
When things could've been better (yeah)
Feelin like you was on a stretcher (yeah)
And all you remember was the hecklers (yeah)
But the universe lifts that weight (yeah)
Then you shine like a new feather (yeah)
Blessings on blessings, et cetera (yeah)
Feelin like the best year ever (yeah)
Damn it's nice

[Chorus]
