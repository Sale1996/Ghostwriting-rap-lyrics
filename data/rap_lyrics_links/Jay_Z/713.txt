[Intro]
Uh, uh-huh-uh (this) uh-huh-uh (is)
Uh-huh-uh, oww!

[Chorus: JAY-Z] + (Beyonce)
Cash, hit deposit, 24-carat faucets
Louis V and Goyard trunks all in the closet
Ain't shit change, the streets is still watchin
And my lil' baby Blue is like, "Who gon' stop us, huh?"
(Ain't no way to stop this looooove, oh ahh)
(Ain't no space if everythiiiiing is love)
(I'm representin for the hustlers all across the world) Still
(Still dippin in my low-lows, girl!) Still
(I put it down for the 713)
(And we still got love for the streets, oww!)

[JAY-Z]
We played it cool at the pool of the Canc√∫n, VMA
Confidence you exude make the fools stay away
Me, I played my room, let the fools have they say
Fate, had me sittin next to you on the plane
And I knew straight away, uh
The next time we would speak was like two years away
You had a man, you shut it down until you two had a break
... I bet that dude rued the day
You kept me up on the phone while you were away
You came back, I let you set the date
Nobu on the plate
I brought my dude to play it cool, my first foolish mistake (ay)

[Chorus]

[JAY-Z]
I never knew a lo-, lo-, lo-, love like this
Gotta be special for me to write this
Queen, I ain't mean no disrespect
But the way I network, it's hard for me to connect
My first time in the ocean went exactly as you'd expect
Meanwhile you goin hard, jumpin off the top deck
A leap of faith, I knew I was up next
I never told you, but I told a few people we wed
Me, I'm off to Rome, you goin back home instead
My first time in my life a live nigga felt dead
You came back, I had to act like it was cool in my head
Thoughts of jumpin the broom, a player never been swept

[Chorus: JAY-Z] + (Beyonce)
Cash, hit deposit, 24-carat faucets
Louis V and Goyard trunks all in the closet
Ain't shit change, the streets is still watchin
And my lil' baby Blue is like, "Who gon' stop us, huh?"
(I'm representin for the hustlers all across the world) Still
(Still dippin in my low-lows, girl!) Still
(I put it down for the 713)
(And we still got love for the streets, oww!)

[Outro: JAY-Z]
To all the good girls that love hustlers
To the mothers that put up with us
To all the babies that suffered cause us
We only know love because of ya
America's a muh'fucker to us
Lock us up, shoot us
Shoot our self-esteem down, we don't deserve true love
Black queen you, rescued us
You rescued us, rescued us
Yeah
