[Intro: Kanye]
Oh man, uh-oh
1985 white Lamborghini Countach, 2 of 'em

[Chorus: Kanye West]
I need a slow motion video right now
Cause I'm movin in - slow motion, slow motion
Feelin like Hype Williams shootin a nigga
Shootin a nigga, ay hey hey
I need a slow motion video right now
Ay, ay...

[Kanye West]
Damn baby, pussy can't be your only hustle
Unless you bad as Naomi Russell
I mean a lot of niggaz got money
So basically, Russell ain't the only Russell
Russell Brand, Russell Crowe
Zero zero zero zero, a whole lotta 0's
What you after, actor money?
You in line behind currency, yeah you after money
Bullet-proof condom, when I'm in these hoes
Got staples on my dick, why? Fuckin centerfolds
Heh, and I swear to God they so cold
Got a nigga in Miami wearin winter clothes
I got my fur on, feelin like Jerome
She got her fur too, we get our his and her on
Don't look at the jewelry, or get your blur on
Too close, you comatose, so dope you over-dose
Get back you over-close, oh no
The hood was stuntin then I blessed 'em with that Polo
Niggaz is makin music and then my first solo
Collo' Dro-lo, sponsored by Manolo
She got Zeppi Notos, ready for some photos
Yeah, and I'm cold, bitch please try to keep the do' closed
Lanvin thousand dollar tee with no logos
Let me show you what I see when my eyes closed

[Jay-Z] Take it how you want 'til a nigga dead
[Kanye] 'Til then, I'm the illest motherfucker aliiiiive
[Jay-Z] Yeah, yeah, uh-huh; whole world aimin at a nigga head
[Kanye] Because I'm the illest motherfucker aliiiiive

[Jay-Z]
Yeah, yeah, uh-huh, hol' up!
King Hov', I'm exactly what the fuck you think
11 in a row, Bill Russell rings
Michael Jordan swag, y'all think Michael Jordan bad
Nigga I got five more rings than Michael Jordan had
Elvis has left the building now, I'm on The Beatles' ass
Niggaz hear "Watch the Throne," yeah, it's like The Beatles back
Bey Bey my Yoko Ono, Rih Rih completes the family
Imagine how that's gon' look front row at the Grammy's
Fuck your awards like Eddie Murphy's couch
"The Roc is in the building, we shoulda stayed in the house!
I don't even know what we doin here"
Seems to me a complete waste of gear
Just a fuckin waste of time, a complete waste of bottles
Niggaz fashion is weak, they be wastin all the models
Got the over-sized Roley, let me show thee how to do it
When I say it then you see it, it ain't only in the music
Basquiat's, Warhol's, servin as my muses
My house like a museum so I see 'em when I'm peein
Usually you have this much taste you European
That's the end of that way of thinkin, nigga never again
Know when to leave when the +Heat+ is comin, I learned that
This is where DeNiro would be, if he ain't turn back
Fuck Sosa, this Hova, this is real life
That is what the endin of "Scarface" should feel like!

[Chorus]

[Kid Cudi]
I'm movin in slow motion, slow motion {*5X*}
