[Intro: Swizz Beatz] + (Jay-Z)
I got a million ways to get it (uh-huh, geah)
... Choose one (choose one, hey)
Ay, bring it back, bring it back (uh-huh)
Now double your money and make a stack
I'm on to the next one, on to the next one
I'm on to the next one, on to the next one
I'm on to the next one, on to the next one
I'm on to the next one, on to the next one
(Hold up) Freeze! Ay!
Somebody bring me back the money please, hey

[Jay-Z]
Hov' on that new shit, niggaz like "How come?"
Niggaz want my old shit, buy my old album
Niggaz stuck on stupid, I gotta keep it movin
Niggaz make the same shit, me I make +The Blueprint+
Came in the Range, hopped out that Lexus
Every year since, I been on that next shit
Traded in the gold for the platinum Rolexes
Now a nigga wrist match the status of my records
Used to rock a throwback, ballin on the corner
Now I rock a teller suit, lookin like a owner
No I'm not a Jonas, Brother I'm a grown-up
No I'm not a virgin, I use my cojones
I move onward, the only direction
Can't be scared to fail, searchin perfection
Gotta keep it fresh girl, even when we sexin
But don't be mad at him when he's on to the next one

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Freeze! Ay!
Somebody bring me back the money please, hey
I got a million ways to get it
... Choose one
Ay, bring it back, bring it back
Now double your money and make a stack
I'm on to the next one, on to the next one
I'm on to the next one, on to the next one
I'm on to the next one, on to the next one
I'm on to the next one, on to the next one
(Hold up) Freeze! Ay!
Somebody bring me back the money please, hey

[Jay-Z]
Fuck a throwback jersey cause we on to the next one
And fuck that Auto-Tune cause we *onnnnn*
And niggaz don't be mad cause it's all about progression
Loiterers should be arrested
I used to drink Cristal, the muh'fucker's racist
So I switched gold bottles on to that Spade shit
You gon' have another drink or you just gon' baby-sit
On to the next one, somebody call the waitress
Baby I'm a boss, I don't know what they do
I don't get dropped, I drop the label
World can't hold me, too much ambition
Always knew it'd be like this when I was in the kitchen
Niggaz in the same spot, me I'm dodgin raindrops
Meanin I'm on vaca', chillin on a big yacht
Yeah I got on flip-flops, white Louie boat shoes
Y'all should grow the fuck up, c'mere let me coach you
Hold up

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z]
Uhh, +Big Pimpin'+ in the house now
Bought the land, tore the muh'fuckin house down
Bought the car, tore the muh'fuckin roof off
Ride clean, I don't ever take the shoes off
Bought the jeep, tore the muh'fuckin doors off
Foot out that bitch, ride the shit like a skateboard
Navigation on, tryin to find my next thrill
Feelin myself, I don't even need an X pill
Can't chill but my neck will
Haters really gon' be mad off my next deal
Uhh, I don't know why they worry 'bout my pockets
Meanwhile I had Oprah chillin in the projects
Had her out in Bed-Stuy, chillin on the steps
Drinkin quarter waters, I gotta be the best
M.J. at Summer Jam, Obama on the text
Y'all should be afraid of what I'm gon' do next
Hold up

[Chorus]
