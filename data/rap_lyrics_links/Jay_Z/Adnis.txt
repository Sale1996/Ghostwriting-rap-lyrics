[Jay-Z]
Uhh, letter to my dad that I never wrote
Speeches I prepared that I never spoke
Words on a paper that I never read
Proses never penned, they stayed in my head
Jotted on dotted lines "I'ma fight you nigga"
From stories that I heard, I'm just like you nigga
Must've been some pain in your past too
Must've been a karma that was past due
Must it be the energy that passed through
Must've been a pastor, many snafus
Started a good man, you married my momma
I was in her belly, you hurried that summer
She had two kids from a previous mister
One family, I don't believe in half-sisters
Never treated my brother like a step, pop
Remembered the many lessons when we stepped out...
What was you preparin' us... for?

Did you see the runt, as the front-runner
or leader of the pack? You see that in your youngins?
What ancestors did you summon to the summit
to, give me what I needed? What you need to take from 'em?
The tsunamis that I swum in to become in
Had the cable with the anchor for the places that I sunk in
Unc' in a better place but you couldn't function
Shot junk in your arms, more than your veins was punctured
I punted on feelings, cause you said you was comin'
You couldn't kick the habit, I wish you said somethin'
You can't avenge these many sins with your own hands
You wanna make God laugh, just tell Him your plans
Who would've thought I'd be the dad I never had?
Be the husband I've become, usually nothin' come from that
I forgive you as I live through the beautiful present of the past
I'm just thankful that I get all these gifts to unwrap
What were you preparin' us... for?
