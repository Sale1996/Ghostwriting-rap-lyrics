[Jay-Z]
Uhh, I just want a Picasso
in my casa, no my castle
I'm a hassa, no I'm an asshole
I'm never, satisfied, +Can't Knock My Hustle+
I want a Rothko, no, I want a brothel
No, I want a wife that fuck me like a prostitute
Let's make love on a million
in a dirty hotel with the fan on the ceiling, uhh
All for the love of drug dealin, uhh
Marble floors, uh, gold ceilings, uh
... Ohh what a feelin
... Fuck it, I want a billion!
Jeff Koons balloons, I just wanna blow up
Condos in my condos, I want a row of
Christie's with my missy, live at the MoMA
Bacons and turkey bacons, smell the aroma

[Chorus 2X: Jay-Z]
Oh what a feelin
Picasso Baby, ca, Picasso baby
Ca, ca, Picasso baby
Ca, ca, Picasso baby

[Jay-Z]
It ain't hard to tell, I'm the new Jean Michel
Surrounded by Warhols, my whole team ball
Twin Bugattis outside the Art Basel
I just wanna live life colossal
Leonardo Da Vinci flows
Riccardo Tisci, Givenchy clothes
See me Throne'in at the Met
Voguin on these niggaz, champagne on my breath, yes
House like the Louvre or the Tate Modern
Cause I be goin ape at the auction
... Ohh what a feelin
... Aw fuck it, I want a trillion!
Sleepin every night next to Mona Lisa
The modern day version with better features
Yellow Basquiat in my kitchen corner
Go ahead lean on that shit Blue, you own it, uh!

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

"Jay, comment tu dis nombre d'or?"
"The golden number."
"Touch√©."

{*beat changes*}

[Jay-Z]
Uh-uh uh uh, uh uh-uh uh
Ah, ch-ah, ch-ah, ch-uh
Uhh, uh, ch-ah, ch-ah, uhh
Ch-ch-ah, ch-ah, ch-ah, uhh
Ch-ch-ah, ch-ah, ch-ah, uhh
Ch-ch-ch-ah, ch-ah, ch-ah, ch-uhh
Ch-ch-ah, ch-ah, ch-ah, uhh
Okay

I never stuck my cock in the Fox's box
But, damned if I ain't open Pandora's box
They try to slander your man on CNN and Fox
My Miranda's don't stand a chance with cops
Even my old fans like "Old man just stop"
I could if I would but I can't, I'm hot~!
And you blow, I'm still the man to +Watch+
Hublot, on my left hand or not
Soon I step out of booth the cameras pop
Niggaz is cool with it 'til the Canons/cannons pop
Now my hand on the bible on the stand
Got your man in the jam again, got my hand in cuffs
I'm like God damn, enough...
I put down the cans and they ran amok!
My hairpin, pierce skin, rupture spleens
Crack ribs, go through cribs and other things
No sympathy for the king, huh?
Niggaz even talk about "Your baby crazy"
Eventually the pendulum swings
Don't forget America this how you made me
Come through with the 'Ye mask on
Spray everything like SAMO; I won't scratch the Lambo
What's it gon' take, for me to go
for you to see, I'm the modern day Pablo?
Picasso baby
