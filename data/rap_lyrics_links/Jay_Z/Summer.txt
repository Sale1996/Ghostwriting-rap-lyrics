[Intro: Rory]
Right now inside the place to be with the one JAY-Z and Bey
Slowing down the dance to a different type of speed, hey wah!
You know it Cool & Dre deh pon the beat
You know, a bloodclaat heat (right)

[Chorus: Beyonce] + (JAY-Z)
Let's make love in the summertime, yeah
On the sands, beach sands
Make plans, to be in each other's arms
Yeah (let it breathe) yeah (let it breathe)
I wanna drown in the depths of you
Yeah yeah - yeah yeah
When the water's so blue (so blue, so blue)
So blue, so blue (uhh, go)
I need to take my time, oh yeahhh
Show you somethin real (so real)
So real (let it breathe)
So real (let it breathe) so real
I want you to come inside right now
So you know just how I feel
How I feel (let it breathe, let it breathe) yeah

[Beyonce]
We never been this far from the shore
We might not ever go back anymore
Got you all in yo' emotions, hit you with the force then
Tell me your desires; I won't ever tire
You'd rather play the game than to throw the fight
Boy you know that ain't right
When I'm needing your affection, I need that attention
Up and down motion; come swim in my ocean, yeah yeah

[Chorus: Beyonce] + (JAY-Z)
Let's make love in the summertime, yeah
On the sands, beach sands
Make plans, to be in each other's arms
(Let it breathe, let it breathe)
I wanna drown in the depths of you
Yeah yeah - yeah yeah
When the water's so blue (blue, go)
So blue (yeah) so blue, uh

[JAY-Z]
I brought my sand to the beach, hopped out the Lamb' with the sheep
Skin rugs on the floor, we hugged, made love on the seats
We tried to hide in the hills, we watched the sky turn peach
Summer's light like, summer's night is like, Christ masterpiece
She taste like Corona Light, sweet, even the lime gotta squeeze
She gave me a lil' swig, to chase behind my weed
If I could stay in her hair forever, that'd be fine by me
I don't have no concept of time even with a rose gold Concept on me
I remember summer nights in the projects, bullet rounds interruptin my ch'i
When the worst thing that could happen zipped up his jacket and ran back down the street
In Bel-Air only the nights get cold, I wrapped a yellow jacket 'round Bey
It's not lost on me, music has my kids sound asleep

[Chorus: Beyonce] + (JAY-Z)
Oooh let's make love in the summertime, yeah
On the sands, beach sands
Make plans to be in each other's arms
(Let it breathe) yeah (let it breathe) yeah
I need to take my time, to show you somethin real (so real)
This is real (so real)
I want you to come inside right now
So you know just how I feel, how I feel
Let's make love in the summertime
Let's make love in the summertime
Be in each other's arms
(Mm, mm, let it breathe, let it breathe)
Let's make love in the summertime
On the sands, beach sands
Make plans, to love in each other's arms (mm, mm)

[Outro: Damian Marley]
Man, love nevah change, ya know
People change, ya know
Love nevah change
Love is, universal
Love is going to express itself
as a form of forgiveness and compassion, ya know
For each other, ya know?
