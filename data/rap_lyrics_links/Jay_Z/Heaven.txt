[Intro: Justin Timberlake]
Have you ever? {*3X*}
Have you ever? {*3X*}

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Have you ever been to Heaven? Uh
Have you ever seen the gates? Uh
Have you bowed unto your highness?
And do you know how Heaven taste?
Knock me down

[Jay-Z]
Yeah... uhh
Arm-Leg-Leg-Arm-Head, this is God-body
Knowledge, Wisdom, Freedom, Understanding, we Just want our Equality
Food, Clothing, Shelter, help a nigga find some Peace/piece
Happiness for a gangsta, ain't no Love in these streets
Uhh, conspiracy theorist screamin "Illuminati"
They can't believe this much skill is in the human body
He's 6'2", how the fuck he fit in the new Bugatti?
... Aw fuck it, you got me
Question religion, question it all
Question existence until them questions are solved
Meanwhile this heretic, I be out in Marrakesh
Morocco smokin hashish with my fellowship
Y'all dwell on devil shit - I'm in a Diablo
Yellow shit, color of Jell-O shit
Uh, hello bitch! Uh, it's me again
Fresh in my Easter clothes feelin like Jesus and

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z]
That's me in the corner, uh
That's me in the spotlight, uh
Losing my religion
(Losing my religion, losing my religion)
I'm gettin ghost in the Ghost, can you see me? Can you see me?
Have mercy on a Judas, angel wings on the 'ghini
I'm, secular, tell the hecklers seckle down
Y'all religion creates division like my Maybach partition and
God is my chauffeur, boy they love Hova
From the south side of Chi to Brooklyn where I growed up
I confess, God in the flesh
Live among the serpents; turn arenas into churches
Uhhh, I'm like Michael recycled
These are not 16's, these is verses from the Bible
Tell that preacher he's a preacher, I'm a muh'fuckin prophet
Smoke a tree of knowledge, drink from a gold chalice
Uhh, you gotta love it
I arrived at the pearly gates, I had luggage
Meanin I had baggage
Niggaz askin me questions, I don't answer to these busters
Only God could judge us, muh'fuckers, uhh

[Chorus] - minus last line

[Justin Timberlake]
Heaven or Hell, the cards we been dealt
Are the cards that we play, play, play, uh
Die for what you believe, only one god recedes
When the shots spray, spray, spray
Knock me down

[Chorus]

[Justin Timberlake]
Knock me down
