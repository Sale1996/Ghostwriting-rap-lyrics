[Jay-Z]
Uh, niggaz wanna kidnap wifey
Good luck with that, bruh
You must gon' hide your whole family
What you think we wearin black for?
Ready for that war, ready for that war, ready
You ain't ready, yo you radio, you ain't really ready
... Real shit ch'ere
Alpo bought his bricks here
Elvis got his record took
It's like we got our seventh gear
Yeah, NFL investigations
Oh don't make me laugh
... FBI investigation
We stood up to that
Facts only, everything real in my raps only
Every nigga real in my clique really
Everyone's a movie star you got to film me
La familia~!

Ready for that war, ready for that war, ready
You ain't ready, yo you radio, you ain't really ready

[Jay-Z]
My brothers is my brother like my brother is
My niggaz is my brother like my mother's kids
Not just in good times, that's that sucka shit
But in war times it's just what it is
Head of the family
All my niggaz bosses though
Y'all don't understand we
We talk that shit that bosses know
Uhh, triple fuckin O.G.
What's up to my nigga Juan?
Tell these niggaz pull they fuckin skirt down
I could see they ovaries
Niggaz snitchin switchin teams
Out here tellin bitches things
Industry talk behind yo' back
Ain't nobody got time for that!
Facts only, everything real in my raps only
Every nigga real in my clique really
Even the girls keep it 200 and trilly
It's la familia~!

[Chorus]
