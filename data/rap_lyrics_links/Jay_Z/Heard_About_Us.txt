[Chorus: Beyonce]
Ay, no need to ask, you heard about us
No need to ask, you heard about us
Already know you know abouuuuut us
No need to ask, you heard about us
No need to ask, you heard about us
Watch your mouth when you arouuuuund us

[Beyonce]
Pull up, hop out, wreck
Got, no time but we got Pateks
I, come around steppin on necks
My, nigga got niggaz upset
Why? Oh why these bitches so mad for?
They don't want Yonce on their door
Louie Slugger to your four-door
Careful you get what you ask for
We go, go-ohh
Go to Cuba then Aruba in the middle of the winter
(Winter, winter, winter, winter)
Ohh (skrt skrt)
Brand new Sprinter, ohh yeah
We laugh to the bank
But we ain't no joke, yeah
You better act like you know, yeah

[Chorus] w/ minor variations

[Interlude: Beyonce]
If you don't know, now you know nigga
He smokin, we drank D'USSÃ‰ to the face (yeah)
If you don't know, now you know nigga
Put hoes in their place, bitch stay in your lane
Bitch stay in your lane

[JAY-Z]
Hehehe, talk that talk B

+Billie Jean+ in his prime
For the thousandth time the kid ain't mine
Online they call me "dad," kiddingly
You're not supposed to take this dad thing literally
That's too famous
We don't even really do famous
I'm cool on that, chuck the two fingers
Every day I'm gettin sued famous
I show up to court without a suit famous
Your every move is on the news, ain't it?
Shit has its perks too, ain't it?
Shootin videos in the Louvre, ain't it?
It could be far worse for you, can't it?
Pain comes with penthouse views, ain't it?
Bitch know me, I been me since the cocaine
Bitch know B, she don't even need a whole name (hehe)
It's Beyonce nigga, oh my God

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Beyonce]
And if you don't know, now you know nigga
He smokin, we drank D'USS... to the face
And if you don't know, now you know nigga
Put hoes in their place, bitch stay in your lane

[Outro: Beyonce]
Yeah, we the ones that you heard about
Make big noise, big noise, we don't need no voucher
Yeah, we the ones y'all worried about
We good, we good, keep us out your mouth
If you don't know, now you know niggaaaaaaaaaa
If you don't know, now you know niggaaaaa
