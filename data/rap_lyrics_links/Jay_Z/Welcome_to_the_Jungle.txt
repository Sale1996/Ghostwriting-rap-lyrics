[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
Right... OH! OH~! Right?
One two one two, ey
Welcome to the jungle
Welcome to the jungle well, yeah
Welcome to the jungle
Welcome to the jungle well

[Kanye West]
I asked her where she wanna be when she twenty-five
She turned around and looked at me and she said "Alive"

[Swizz Beatz]
Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well

[Jay-Z]
Black Axl Rose, move halfs and wholes
Come down to the jungle, just ask for Hov
Move blocks and squares, move apples and pears
Work pots and pans, must to cop me some Airs
My uncle died, my daddy did too
Paralyzed by the pain, I can barely move
My nephew gone, my heart is torn
Sometimes I look to the sky, ask why I was born
My faith in God, every day is hard
Every night is worse, that's why I pray so hard

[Kanye West]
Why I pray so hard, this is crazy God
Just when I thought I had everything I lost it all
So que sera, get a case of Ciroc
Let it chase the pain, 'fore it goes too far

[Jay-Z]
My dreams is big, reality set in
Let off a clip from a automatic weapon
Through shots in the door, it died in Vegas
Though it fought so hard, I knew it wouldn't make it
I'm a tortured soul, I live in disguise
Rest in peace to the leader of the Jackson 5
I died in my sleep, I'm still "Big Pimpin"
I ball at the mall, beginning of the endin
Where the fuck is the sun? It's been a while
Momma look at your son, what happened to my smile?
My tears is tatted, my rag in my pocket
I'm just lookin for love, I know somebody got it
Champagne for the pain, weed for the low
God damn I'm so high, where the fuck did I go?
I'm losing myself, I'm stuck in the moment
I look in the mirror, my only opponent
Where the fuck is the press? Where the fuck is the Pres?
Either they know or don't care I'm fuckin depressed
No crying in public, just lyin to judges
Riskin my life I'm already dyin so fuck it well

[Swizz Beatz]
Welcome to the jungle, welcome to the jungle well
God dammit~!
