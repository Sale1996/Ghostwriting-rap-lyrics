[Chorus - Bilal]
I know I should've did that
I know it's gonna come right back
I know it's gonna destroy everything I made
It's probably gonna get ya boy sent away
But this game I play ain't no way to fix it
It's inevitable that I'm...
 
[Verse 1 - Jay-Z]
Said where I would stop be-
fore' I even started
When I get to one brick
Then the game I would depart with
Got to one brick then I looked to the sky like
Sorry God I lied
But give me one more try
Got the two bricks
New cars new whips
But niggas never learn till they
End up in the news clip
The irony of selling drugs
Is sort of like you using it
Guess it's two sides to what
Substance abuse is
Can't stop won't stop
Addicted to this new shit
Brand new convertibles
I'm so roofless
Front row fight night
See how big my tube is
Fuck HD nigga
See how clear my view is?
(Bilal: Fallin')... But there's a price for overdoing it
Doin' it this big will put you on the map
Stick-up kids is out to tax
Plus the FBI boys with the cameras in the back
Damn.......
 
[Chorus - Bilal]
I know I should've did that
I know it's gonna come right back
I know it's gonna destroy everything I made
It's probably gonna get ya boy sent away
But this game I play ain't no way to fix it
It's inevitable (Jay-Z: Now ya) Fallin'

[Verse Two - Jay-Z]
When you should've fall back
Now ya (Bilal: Fallin')
Right into they lap
Fallin' and applauding
And They screaming at the screen
Damn you fucked up like your favorite movie scene
Godfather Goodfellas Scarface Casino
You seen what that last run did to Denerio
And he can't beat the odds
Can't cheat the Gods
Can't blow to hard
Life's a deck of cards
Now ya tumbling it's humbling
Ya fallin' ya mumbling
Under ya breath like you knew this day was coming
(Bilal: Fallin').... Now let's pray that arm candy
That you left ya ex for stay down and come in handy
Cause come January it gets cold
When the letters start to slow
And ya commissary low
And lawyers screams appeal
Only thinking about a bill
And ya chances are nil
Damn gravity's ill.....
 
[Chorus - Bilal]
I know I should've did that
I know it's gonna come right back
I know it's gonna destroy everything I made
It's probably gonna get ya boy sent away
But this game I play ain't no way to fix it
It's inevitable (Jay-Z: But your) Fallin'
 
[Verse Three - Jay-Z]
And ya can't get up
All you do is push-up
Pull-up sit-up
Locked down the town now belongs to the squares
Who said they won't make the same mistake that got you there
And ya arm candy sweet on em'and the women
That you left for this heffer got a college degree coming
Bad news keeps comin'
Hard to keep something on ya stomach
Your sick 'bout what ya life is becoming
(Bilal: Fallin')... But your use-to's has-beens
Ragging bad 'bout all the new dudes
Talking tough on the Youtube
Bout what you use to do
But that's old school to the new crew
They doin' numbers like Sudoku
There're the new you
And it's damn near inevitable
They'll experience deja vu too
Fight and you'll never survive
Run and you'll never escape
So just fall for Grace
Damn...
 
[Chorus - Bilal]
I know I should've did that
I know it's gonna come right back
I know it's gonna destroy everything I made
It's probably gonna get ya boy sent away
But this game I play ain't no way to fix it
It's inevitable that I'm
 
[Bilal]
Fallin' 
Seems like I'm fallin'
(repeated x7)
fades............
