[Jay-Z]
Uh, hey sucka nigga, wherever you are
I thought about ya fool while I was drivin my car
I wonder if you fools realize how far, ya are
You're nowhere in my rear mirror

Uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh uh
Uhh, uhh, uhh, uhh

Yo' last shit ain't better than my first shit, uhh
Yo' best shit ain't better than my worst shit, uhh
The truth in my verses versus
your metaphors about what your net worth is
Ha ha ha ha ha!
