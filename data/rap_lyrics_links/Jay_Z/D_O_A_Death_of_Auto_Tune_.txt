[Intro: Jay-Z]
{*sings*} La-da da dah, hey-ayy-ayy, goodbyeeee... (good riddance~!)
{*raps*} Hold up! Only rapper to rewrite history without a pen
No I.D. on the track, let the story begin, begin, begin

[Jay-Z]
This is anti-auto-tune, death of the ringtone
This ain't for iTunes, this ain't for sing-alongs
This is Sinatra at the opera, bring a blonde
Preferably with a fat ass who can sing a song
Wrong, this ain't politically correct (ahh)
This might offend my political connects (ahh)
My raps don't have melodies
This should make niggas wan' go and commit felonies (ahh)
Get your chain tooken
I may do it myself, I'm so Brooklyn (ahh)
I know we facin' a recession
But the music y'all makin' gon' make it the Great Depression (ahh)
All y'all lack aggression
Put your skirt back down, grow a set man (ahh)
Nigga this shit violent
This is death of auto-tune, moment of silence

[Chorus: Jay-Z]

{*sings*} La-da da dah, hey-ayy-ayy, goodbyeeee... (Hold up~!)
{*raps*} Only rapper to rewrite history without a pen
No I.D. on the track, let the story begin, begin, begin - hold up!

[Jay-Z]
This ain't a number one record (ahh)
This is practically assault with a deadly weapon (ahh)
I made this just for Flex and
Mister Cee I want niggas to feel threatened (ahh)
Stop your bloodclot cryin'
The kid, the dog, everybody dyin', no lyin'
You niggas' jeans too tight
You colors too bright, your voice too light (that's too far nigga~!)
I might wear black for a year straight (ahh)
I might bring back Versace shades (ahh)
This ain't for Z100
'Ye told me to kill y'all to keep it a hundred (ahh)
This is for Hot 9-7
This shit for Clue, for Khaled +We The Best+'n (ahh)
Aww, nigga this shit violent
This is death of auto-tune, moment of silence

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z]
Hold up, this shit need a verse from Jeezy (AYY!)
I might send this to the mixtape Weezy
Get somebody from BMF to talk on this
Get this to a Blood, let a Crip walk on it (ahh)
3 Thou' to style on this
I just don't need nobody to smile on this (ahh)
You niggas singin' too much
Get back to rap, you T-Painin' too much (ahh, ahh)
I'm a multi-millionaire
So how is it I'm still the hardest nigga here (ahh)
I don't be in the project hallway
Talkin' 'bout how I be in the project all day (ahh)
That sound stupid to me
If you a gangsta this is how you prove it to me (ahh, ahh)
Nigga just get violent
This is death of auto-tune, moment of silence

{*sings*} La-da da dah, hey-ayy-ayy, goodbyeeee...
