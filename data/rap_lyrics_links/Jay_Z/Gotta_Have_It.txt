[Intro: Kanye West]
Turn my headphones up... louder
Eh-heh, eh-heh

[Chorus: samples]
{"What you need, what-what you need"}
{"I got what you need, what-what you need"}
{"What you need, what-what you need"}
{"I got what you need, what-what you need"}

[Kanye West]
Uhh...
LOLOLO hello white America, assassinate my character
Money matrimony, yeah, they tryin to break the marriage up
Who gon' act phonier? Who gon' try to embarrass ya?
I'ma need a day off, I think I'll call Ferris up

[Jay-Z]
Bueller had a Mueller, but I switched it for a Miele
Cause I'm +Richard+, and +Pryor+ to this shit was movin freebase

[Kanye West] + (Jay-Z)
Had a conference with the DJs (Yeah), Puerto Rico three days
(Parlay with them GD's, now they got our shit on replay)
Sorry I'm in pajamas, but I just got off the PJ
And last party we had, they shut down Prive
(Ain't that where the Heat play?) Yep (Niggaz hate ballers these days) Yep
Ain't that like LeBron James? (Ain't that just like D-Wade? Wait)

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z] + (Kanye West)
Whassup? Whassup? Whassup? Whassup?
Whassup muh'fucker, where my money at? ("What you need")
You gon' make me come down to your house where yo' mummy at
Mummy wrap the kids, have 'em cryin for they mummy back
Dummy that your daddy is, tell 'em I just want my racks
(Racks on racks on racks) Racks
(Maybachs on bachs on bachs on bachs on bachs) Who in that?
(Oh shit, it's just blacks on blacks on blacks)
(Hundred stack) How you get it? (Nigga, layin raps on tracks)
I wish I could give you this feelin, I'm plankin on a million
I'm riding through yo' hood, you can bank I ain't got no ceiling
(Made a left on Nostrand Ave) Right (We in Bed-Stuy)
Made a right on 79th, I'm coming down South Shore Drive
(I remain Chi-Town) Brooklyn 'til I die
{"Take 'em on home..."}

[Chorus] overlaid with {"Take 'em on home..."}

{"Tryin to hurt my name huh?"}
