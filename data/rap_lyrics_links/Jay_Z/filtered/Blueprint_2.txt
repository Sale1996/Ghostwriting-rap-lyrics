What y'all niggas get front page articles, y'all mention Jay-Z name<end_line>
 Jay-Z, Jay-Z, in Jay-Z news<end_line>
I understand what y'all trying to do<end_line>
I brought the flutes this time, though<end_line>
I unleashed the flutes on them, guru<end_line>
Gimme some more music in the headphone<end_line>

C'mon<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
H, O V A<end_line>
I got my mojo back baby, oh behave<end_line>
Naw, naw, don't be afraid<end_line>
Y'all and your articles, hard to spit at Jay<end_line>
Y'all from afar threw thoughts my way<end_line>
What you thought, I would naught have nothing to say?  Nope!<end_line>
Y'all fell into the booby trap<end_line>
I set the trap just to see dude react, and now<end_line>
And now you'se can't leave<end_line>
You opened the door god, I'm at you annually<end_line>
And I'm sorry Miss Rosie Perez<end_line>
I call a spade a spade, it just is what it is<end_line>
But you can't give cred to anything dude says<end_line>
Same dude to give you ice and you owe him some head<end_line>
 It's time to wake up the dead<end_line>
You sound a little naive in them articles that I read<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Can't y'all, see that he's fake, the rap version of TD jakes<end_line>
Prophesizing on your CDs and tapes<end_line>
Won't break you a crumb of the little bit that he makes<end_line>
And this is with whom you want to place your faith?<end_line>
I put dollars on mine, ask Columbine<end_line>
When the Twin Towers dropped, I was the first in line<end_line>
Donating proceeds off every ticket sold<end_line>
When I was out on the road, that's how you judge Hov, no?<end_line>
Ain't I supposed to be absorbed myself?<end_line>
Every time there's a tragedy, I'm the first one to help<end_line>
They call me this misogynist, but they don't call me the dude<end_line>
To take his dollars to give gifts at the projects<end_line>
These dudes is all politics, depositing checks<end_line>
they put in they pocket, all you get in return is a lot of lip<end_line>
And y'all buy the shit, caught up in the hype<end_line>
Cause the nigga wear a coofie, it don't mean that he bright<end_line>
Cause you don't understand him, it don't mean that he nice<end_line>
It just means you don't understand all the bullshit that he write<end_line>
Is it "Oochie Wally Wally" or is it "One Mic"?<end_line>
Is it "Black Girl Lost" or shorty owe you for ice?<end_line>
I've been real all my life, they confuse it with conceit<end_line>
Since I will not lose, they try to help him cheat<end_line>
But I will not lose, for even in defeat<end_line>
There's a valuable lesson learned, so it evens up for me<end_line>
When the grass is cut, the snakes will show<end_line>
I gotta thank the little homie Nas for that though<end_line>
Saving me the hassle of speaking to half of these assholes<end_line>
And I'ma let karma catch up to Jaz-O, whoa<end_line>
I'm back before you had a chance to miss me<end_line>
My mama can't save you this time, niggas is history<end_line>
Who you know flow vicious as me?<end_line>
Yet so religiously, that's why they call me Hov<end_line>
I get the spoils cause the victor is me<end_line>
You're an actor, you're not who you're depicted to be<end_line>
The street dreamin, all y'all niggas living through me<end_line>
I gave you life when niggas was forgetting you emcee<end_line>
I'm a legend, you should take a picture with me<end_line>
You should be happy to be in my presence, I should charge you a fee<end_line>
I'm Big Dog, Glenn Rob, listen God you a flea<end_line>
And the little homey Jungle is a garden to me<end_line>
What's the problem B?  You not as hard as me<end_line>
Nigga hard as we, nigga R O C, nigga<end_line>
That's why they follow me, they feel my pain and my agony, nigga<end_line>
I won't rest till you on one knee<end_line>
You want war then it's war's gonna be, nigga<end_line>
Until you on one knee, you want war then it's war's gonna be, nigga<end_line>
