Now where that Southside at? Whassup, whassup<end_line>
Where the West Coast at? Put your W's up<end_line>
Where my East Coast niggas that hustle to live?<end_line>
And all my niggas up north that's doin' a bid?<end_line>
Oh yeah I'm rare, I'm aware that I'm rare<end_line>
I rap and I'm real, I'm one of the few here<end_line>
These other boys lyin', I wonder if y'all care<end_line>
They stories out this world, I wonder if y'all hear<end_line>
But don't really matter as long as they stay clear<end_line>
Clear of the real shit we doin' over here<end_line>
When my nigga get home, I'm gonna send him a Lear<end_line>
For all the time he been down, get him right up in the air<end_line>
With a couple of broads get him right up in the air<end_line>
Mile high club get him right up in there<end_line>
Send my nigga some gear like he never missed a year<end_line>
By the time you hear this song, he'll be standin' right here<end_line>
Real nigga shit, yeah<end_line>

<verse_start>
A hundred million to the good and I'm still talkin' yayo<end_line>
At a snail's, pace I won this race that y'all trail<end_line>
Uh, uh, Blueprint's for sale<end_line>
Followin' my footprints you can't fail<end_line>
Set sail, I used to duck shots but now I eat quail<end_line>
I'll probably never see jail<end_line>
Each tale contains more of the truth<end_line>
Of the statute allows me to go into detail<end_line>
Uh, close your eyes you can smell<end_line>
Hov's the audio equivalent of braille<end_line>
That's why they feel me in the favelas in Brazil<end_line>
And Waterhouse cause real recognize real - RRRRAH~!<end_line>
