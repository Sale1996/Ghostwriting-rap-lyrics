Yeah, fuck your subpoenas and your misdemeanors<end_line>
Was too busy tourin out all your arenas<end_line>
My passport is tatted, it look like it's active<end_line>
I play on these planes, y'all catch me in traffic<end_line>
Y'all drag me in court for that shit, y'all backwards<end_line>
After all of these years of drug traffickin, huh<end_line>
Time to remind me I'm Black again, huh?<end_line>
All this talkin back, I'm too arrogant, huh?<end_line>
What would you do you knew you couldn't fail?<end_line>
I have no fear of anything, do everything well<end_line>
I have no fear of jail, I was born in the trap<end_line>
I have no fear of death, we all born to do that<end_line>
It's just life<end_line>
I'm just nice, tonight I might<end_line>

Damn you Hov', Jesus Christ~!<end_line>

Covered in ice, ice, ice, ice<end_line>
