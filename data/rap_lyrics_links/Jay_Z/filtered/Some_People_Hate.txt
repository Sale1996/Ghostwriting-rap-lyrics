Oh!  This must be the way the nigga 'Pac felt when he made<end_line>
"Me Against the World," "All Eyez on Me"<end_line>
Y'all niggaz got me feelin like all eyes on me, me against the world<end_line>
Mmm, y'all got me on my shit<end_line>
Thought niggaz would appreciate what I did to this game<end_line>
Bein that, I'm flesh of your flesh, blood of your blood<end_line>
Come from the same hood you come from<end_line>
We share basically the same stories<end_line>
Thought niggaz would appreciate what I came and did<end_line>
since ninety-six, every year<end_line>
Somethin must be seriously wrong with the world<end_line>
I know y'all ain't hatin<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Raw rough and rugged, when addressin the mass public<end_line>
My attitude is fuck it cause motherfuckers love it<end_line>
Got a, chip on my shoulder the size of the Golden Nugget in Vegas<end_line>
And fuck bein famous, I came to get the butters<end_line>
I came from the gutter, my success in this game<end_line>
is sort of like "Pro-jectic Justice," a payment for brushes<end_line>
with police officers, a peace offering<end_line>
From the Gods for the streets I was tossed in<end_line>
'Til I'm deceased in a coffin<end_line>
I'ma be a beast on these beats, releasin early and often<end_line>
Please, your disdain for the brothers ain't gon' change the numbers<end_line>
It's the strengthenin of chain among us<end_line>
Please, we ain't afraid of none of yas, who want it with us?<end_line>
Ain't nuttin changed since the ninety-six summers, c'mon<end_line>

I guess it's just the penalty of leadership<end_line>
I guess I'm what niggaz wanna be and shit<end_line>
Or niggaz just bored, wanna be in shit<end_line>
'Fore they get to rappin, start believin it<end_line>
Think they Ali and shit<end_line>
I roll with the punches so I survive<end_line>
I bob and weave, move my feet from side to side<end_line>
I'm back, stronger than ever, surprise surprise<end_line>
They try to take me out the game, but I's alive<end_line>
It's like a old negro spiritual, but I mastered Tobey<end_line>
With a splash of Monster Kody, shoot faster than Kobe, nigga<end_line>
You bastards know me, the one and only<end_line>
Big homey from the Roc, I think you pastors lonely<end_line>
You need Jesus in your life.. it's either that<end_line>
or y'all gon' make me put the double Desert Eagles in your life, nigga!<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Au contraire nigga, I am here cause I earned the shit<end_line>
By ridin out, when niggaz had learner's permit<end_line>
We bring the knives out, or we let them burners spit<end_line>
I bring them pies out if niggaz wanna burn the strip<end_line>
Bring your rides out, bring your buggy eyes out, turn your 6<end_line>
I laid back in the Maebach<end_line>
Nigga this the payback, I know you bitch niggaz from way back<end_line>
Niggaz wanna clown but the pound it don't play dat<end_line>
Get yourself found, drowned, where the lake at<end_line>
Run up on 'em +Notoriously+, "Take that!"<end_line>
And then we comin where your wake at<end_line>
Eight maniac cats strapped with gats, you can hate that<end_line>
Face facts, fake rap cats<end_line>
can't take back what I took back to the Brook', look<end_line>
