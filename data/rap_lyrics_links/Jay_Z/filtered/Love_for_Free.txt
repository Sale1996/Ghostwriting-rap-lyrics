I play my parts with the honies hard<end_line>
It's gotten even worse now that the money's washed<end_line>
Like a letter y'all, the nine-eight find me straight<end_line>
Good health, can't complain about my financial state<end_line>
What else?  I guess tomorrow knows<end_line>
I run through chicks like borrowed clothes<end_line>
I'm the type of nigga your father oppose, never test Jay<end_line>
You follow the code, ese, on my best day<end_line>
I'm like God with a blow, bless me<end_line>

In the SL with Rell, music at a high decimal<end_line>
Mami frontin, touchin buttons like she spec-ial<end_line>
cause she sex well, in the best tell, rapper filla cartel<end_line>
Excel-ing like Hyundai, Sunday to Sunday<end_line>
it's for the nachoes, come out the clothes<end_line>
And baby girl if it's Hammer time, then hide your toes<end_line>
The game cold like, five below, but once inside the show<end_line>
we to' it down; about that money, we throw it around<end_line>
So when the ice hit the sun rays, run for shade<end_line>
Game's over, we didn't come to play<end_line>
The fuck y'all thinking??<end_line>
