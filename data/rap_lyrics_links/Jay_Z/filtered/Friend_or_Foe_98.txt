<verse_start>
I'm done talking<end_line>
Ran up in the spot gun smoking<end_line>
Shot it in the air, one woke him<end_line>
Sun-soaking, sweating in his bed like Dunlo<end_line>
Thinking to himself what done provoked him<end_line>
His thoughts is racing like a vulcan<end_line>
I swear I saw a lightbulb when<end_line>
He finally figured out who was the culprit<end_line>
I said yeah, remember me from Friend or Foe when<end_line>
I told you don't ever ever come around here no more<end_line>
Time to pay now, you try to rise, I wave the gun - lay down<end_line>
This time you're really going to listen to Jay now<end_line>
I try to talk sensibly, hoping that eventually you realize<end_line>
I had this locked and it just wasn't meant to be<end_line>
Plus I had sympathy when we all wore rams with your keys<end_line>
And it wasn't afterthought that maybe you'll try to revenge me<end_line>
But I was like "Nah", Chromes had to know he was wrong<end_line>
And if you caught me on the foul now you would sing me the same song<end_line>
Plus you promised<end_line>
And that's really no fun <end_line>
Yeah I find you in this Motel 6 with all these guns<end_line>
And all your goons, lined up in adjoining rooms<end_line>
Like some wild cowboys coming to get me at high noon<end_line>
But my mind's like a flower in bloom<end_line>
*** my eyes just scower the room<end_line>
I'm alert, plus I paid the clerk I got it laid out<end_line>
You think you the first nigga I played out, in a 2 hotel town? <end_line>
Come on now, I peep your Lexus at you<end_line>
Left the exit got some niggas on that side of the town<end_line>
Money well invested, rudely interrupted<end_line>
Jamaican accents *** <end_line>
A gun in your face and that's all you can come up with?<end_line>
I'm done talking, back up and clap them, one in the abdomen <end_line>
Do me a favor dude, get 2 ice cubes I pass them<end_line>
Take that ice up, for the nicest MC<end_line>
And please yo, tell BIG, he's unbelievable <end_line>
Friend or foe BIOTCH!<end_line>
