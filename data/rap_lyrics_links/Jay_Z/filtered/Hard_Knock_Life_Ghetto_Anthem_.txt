<verse_start>
From standin on the corners boppin<end_line>
to drivin some of the hottest cars New York has ever seen<end_line>
For droppin some of the hottest verses rap has ever heard<end_line>
From the dope spot, with the smoke Glock<end_line>
fleein the murder scene, you know me well<end_line>
from nightmares of a lonely cell, my only hell<end_line>
But since when y'all niggaz know me to fail?  Fuck naw<end_line>
Where all my niggaz with the rubber grips, bust shots<end_line>
And if you with me mom I rub on your tits, and what-not<end_line>
I'm from the school of the hard knocks, we must not<end_line>
let outsiders violate our blocks, and my plot<end_line>
let's stick up the world and split it fifty/fifty, uh-huh<end_line>
Let's take the dough and stay real jiggy, uh-huh<end_line>
And sip the Cris' and get pissy-pissy<end_line>
Flow infinitely like the memory of my nigga Biggie, baby!<end_line>
You know it's hell when I come through<end_line>
The life and times of Shawn Carter <end_line>
nigga Volume 2, y'all niggaz get ready<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I flow for those 'dro'ed out; all my niggaz <end_line>
locked down in the ten by fo', controllin the house<end_line>
We live in hard knocks, we don't take over we borrow blocks<end_line>
Burn em down and you can have it back daddy, I'd rather that<end_line>
I flow for chicks wishin, they ain't have to strip to pay tuition<end_line>
I see you vision mama, I put my money on the longshots<end_line>
All my ballers that's born to clock<end_line>
Now I'ma be on top whether I perform or not<end_line>
I went from lukewarm to hot; sleepin on futons and cots<end_line>
to King Size, dream machines, the green fives<end_line>
I've seen pies let the thing between my eyes analyze life's ills<end_line>
Then I put it down type real<end_line>
I'm tight grill with the phony, rappers y'all might feel we homies<end_line>
I'm like still, y'all don't know me, shit!<end_line>
I'm type real when my situation ain't improvin<end_line>
I'm tryin to murder everything movin, feel me?!<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I don't how to sleep, I gotta eat, stay on my toes<end_line>
Gotta a lot of beef, so logically, I prey on my foes<end_line>
Hustling's still inside of me, and as far as progress<end_line>
you'd be hard-pressed, to find another rapper hot as me<end_line>
I gave you prophecy on my first joint, and y'all lamed out<end_line>
Didn't really appreciate it, til the second one came out<end_line>
So I stretched the game out, X'ed your name out<end_line>
Put Jigga on top, and drop albums non-stop for ya, nigguh!<end_line>
<verse_end>
