<verse_start>
I'm from the streets where the<end_line>
hood could swallow a man, bullets'll follow a man<end_line>
There's so much coke that you could run the slalom<end_line>
And cops comb the shit top to bottom<end_line>
They say that we are prone to violence, but it's home sweet home<end_line>
Where personalities clash and chrome meets chrome<end_line>
The coke prices up and down like it's Wall Street homes<end_line>
But this is worse than the Dow Jones your brains are now blown<end_line>
all over that brown Brougham, one slip you are now gone<end_line>
Welcome to hell where you are welcome to sell<end_line>
But when them shells come you better return 'em<end_line>
All scars we earn 'em, all cars we learn 'em like the back of our hand<end_line>
We watch for cops hoppin out the back of van<end_line>
Wear a G on my chest, I don't need Dapper Dan<end_line>
This ain't a sewn outfit homes, homes is about it<end_line>
Was clappin them flamers before I became famous<end_line>
For playin me y'all shall forever remain nameless<end_line>
I am Hov'<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Sure I do, I tell you the difference between me and them<end_line>
They tryin to get they ones, I'm tryin to get them M's<end_line>
One million, two million, three million, four<end_line>
In just five years, forty million more<end_line>
You are now lookin at the forty million boy<end_line>
I'm rapin Def Jam 'til I'm the hundred million man<end_line>
R., O., C.<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I came into this motherfucker a hundred grand strong<end_line>
Nine to be exact, from grindin G-packs<end_line>
Put this shit in motion ain't no rewindin me back<end_line>
Could make 40 off a brick but one rhyme could beat that<end_line>
And if somebody woulda told 'em that Hov' would sell clothin<end_line>
Heh, not in this lifetime, wasn't in my right mind<end_line>
That's another difference that's between me and them<end_line>
Heh, I'm smarten up, open the market up<end_line>
One million, two million, three million, four<end_line>
In eighteen months, eighty million more<end_line>
Now add that number up with the one I said before<end_line>
You are now lookin at one smart black boy<end_line>
Momma ain't raised no fool<end_line>
Put me anywhere on God's green earth, I'll triple my worth<end_line>
Motherfucker - I, will, not, lose<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I sell ice in the winter, I sell fire in hell<end_line>
I am a hustler baby, I'll sell water to a well<end_line>
I was born to get cake, move on and switch states<end_line>
Cop the Coupe with the roof gone and switch plates<end_line>
Was born to dictate, never follow orders<end_line>
Dickface, get your shit straight, fucka this is Big Jay<end_line>
I.. hahahaha..<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
.. will, not, lose, ever.. FUCKA!<end_line>
<verse_end>
