Where's Iceberg Slim he was the coldest cat<end_line>
Get your swag back daddy where your focus at<end_line>
Got to admit a little bit I was sick of rap<end_line>
But despite that the boy is back<end_line>
And I'm so evolved I'm so involved<end_line>
I'm showing growth, I'm so in charge<end_line>
I'm C.E.O. and yeah going god<end_line>
I'm so indebted, I should have been deaded<end_line>
Sellin blow in the park, this I know in my heart<end_line>
Now I'm so enlightened I might glow in the dark<end_line>

Cause niggas like it, you love it; We be it, you're of it<end_line>
You breathe it, we need it; bring it back to the hustlas<end_line>
Had to dust off the Hammer, dance - can't touch this<end_line>

Got 'em dancing on the bankhead, like they from Bankhead<end_line>
Fuck Cristal, so they ask me what we drinking<end_line>
I thought dudes remark was rude okay<end_line>
So I moved on to Dom Cuv√©e Rose<end_line>
And it's much bigger issues in the world, I know<end_line>
But I first had to take care of the world I know<end_line>
I'm from the bottom, so I still feel em from the bottom<end_line>
Underdog before my cape, still couldn't stop him<end_line>
Flash Gordon when recording, spark the light in the dark<end_line>
Peter Park, Spiderman, all I do is climb the charts<end_line>

The War-Hova, but who you know took over tracks like that<end_line>
Guess what New York, New York - we back<end_line>
And I ain't never been afraid of a drought<end_line>
Since I was six, seventeen been gettin money down south<end_line>
Bout it, bout it, Master P<end_line>
