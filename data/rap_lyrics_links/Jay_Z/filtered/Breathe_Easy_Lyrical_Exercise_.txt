<verse_start>
I jog in the graveyard<end_line>
Spar in the same ring<end_line>
Now it's house by the building<end_line>
Where Malcolm X was slain<end_line>
I spring train in the winter<end_line>
Round early December<end_line>
Run suicide drills over and over<end_line>
With the weight of the world on my shoulder<end_line>
That's why they call me "Hova"<end_line>
I'm far from being God<end_line>
But I work goddamn hard<end_line>
I wake up the birds who in the nerves is sleep<end_line>
I'm catching my second wind the second the first one end<end_line>
I am "focused man"<end_line>
And I'm not afraid of death<end_line>
And I'm going all out<end_line>
I circle the vultures in a van and<end_line>
I run the block<end_line>
Pull up in a drop<end_line>
Push up on my money<end_line>
I'm in great shape dunny<end_line>
I keep jacks jumping thirty six sets<end_line>
Like a personal trainer I teach coke to stretch<end_line>
I pump and rock sweats<end_line>
All white trainers<end_line>
The ghettoes, Billy Blanks<end_line>
I show you niggas what pain is<end_line>
Maintain your stamina<end_line>
Hov will damage ya<end_line>
Spot you two rhymes y'all niggas is amateurs<end_line>
The fifth<end_line>
A dead lift if<end_line>
Niggas don't want to get shot then y'all niggas better squat<end_line>
I drop your set for rep<end_line>
No need to hit the showers<end_line>
The spit from the fifth leave you wet<end_line>
Lyrical exercise<end_line>
Y'all niggas ain't tired right?<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Get your weight up<end_line>
Not your hate up<end_line>
Jigga man is diesel<end_line>
When I lift the eight up<end_line>
Y'all ain't ready to workout with the boy<end_line>
Your flow is brain on drugs<end_line>
Mines is rap on steroids<end_line>
I lift every voice when I sing<end_line>
My ability<end_line>
Make yours look like an exercise in futility<end_line>
Bring your squad<end_line>
Biceps, Triceps, and Quads<end_line>
We don't struggle with undeveloped muscles<end_line>
Y'all ain't real<end_line>
That's y'all Achilles Heel<end_line>
Same routine when you see me you know the drill<end_line>
I spot ya<end_line>
I lift the weight of the watch off your arm<end_line>
Remain nice and calm<end_line>
Put down your things<end_line>
Trinidad of the game know my way around your ring<end_line>
No matter how many pounds you bring<end_line>
It sounds like the same old thing<end_line>
R-O-C is the strongest team<end_line>
