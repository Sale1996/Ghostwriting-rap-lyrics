<verse_start>
Yeah it's magic<end_line>
Uhh, Jay-Z and Lenny Kravitz<end_line>
And it's a Heavy D production you bastards<end_line>
Come on<end_line>
Ha hey yo stop playin man<end_line>
This is real serious<end_line>
Hayeah yo<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Lets go<end_line>
Post Postatono, Hov' hangin with Bono<end_line>
U2 can live like Salvatore Ferragamo<end_line>
And U2 can cool out poolside at the Delano<end_line>
And U2 flow like you was out of your mind yo<end_line>
Cause who knew dude that loved apple pies from McDonalds<end_line>
Would soon be the boss of the Big Apple, ya know<end_line>
And who knew dude that played ball for the NBA<end_line>
Would make a mistake on the who knew estates, throw it away<end_line>
Who knew that would be his last shot, who drew up that play<end_line>
They giveth and they taketh life is cruel that way<end_line>
But even a broken clock is right at least two times a day<end_line>
You could have turned Guns into Roses like two times today<end_line>
Now heres something you gotta say two times to Jay<end_line>
I got my shades on waiting for the sun to shine my way<end_line>
Got my boom box, suntan lotion waiting for action<end_line>
They say when you play with skills, good luck could happen<end_line>
Let's go<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Things got too hot so I jumped off in this rap shit<end_line>
You got it kris-krossed ain't no turning me backwards<end_line>
Too many District Attorneys concerned with the actions<end_line>
Of one individual he's criminally attached<end_line>
I turned in all my rap chips I'm earning my bachelors<end_line>
While dating all the models and actresses<end_line>
I'm learning all the potholes in every single barrio<end_line>
Trying not to mess up my axis kid<end_line>
On the road to the riches through trafficking<end_line>
Through rappining and whatever's happening<end_line>
Roc-a-wear I'm the young black Ralph Lauren<end_line>
Every time I get out they put me right back in<end_line>
The Michael Corleone of the microphone<end_line>
The Michelangelo of flow I paint pictures with poems<end_line>
I gather no moss like a rolling stone<end_line>
Case the Grim Reaper visits my home, nigga I'm gone c'mon<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Tote more Guns then Roses, foes is, <end_line>
visibly shook of the invisible bully, let's go<end_line>
Flowers need water to grow, it gotta rain<end_line>
And in order to experience joy you need pain<end_line>
Every time a baby is born, somebodys slain<end_line>
You know the saying, somebody's lose is another's gain<end_line>
The sun comes out when the water goes down the drain<end_line>
A rainbow then the clouds come out we do it again<end_line>
Everything evens up, you just wait<end_line>
Even a garbage can gets a steak<end_line>
You ain't even a garbage can you have faith<end_line>
But when it turns your way before it turns away<end_line>
Gotta turn that into something you gotta learn from Jay<end_line>
You will get return in your investment if attention you pay let's go<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Life is all about Guns and Roses<end_line>
<verse_end>
