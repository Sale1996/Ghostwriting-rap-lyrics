Niggas say I'm focused now, they know that's my style<end_line>
But dogg, I'm on the block with that coke and a smile<end_line>
I still got the crack heads I.D.<end_line>
And they know, I collect for the first and fifteenth<end_line>
I still take cabs to that capsule spot<end_line>
For them 31 illusions and them purple tops<end_line>
And the game aint change, niggas is taught different<end_line>
I'm raised off one rule, never get caught slippin<end_line>
That's why I eat, sleep, shit with my gat<end_line>
Bag up, take a piss, fuck a bitch with my gat<end_line>
And I done sold it all from crack to marijuana<end_line>
You can't deny it, I'm in hoods like Tom Warner<end_line>
Beat cop, take away, I keep my shit<end_line>
They don't know I deliver off the beeps I get<end_line>
And you snitch ass niggas wanna peep my shit<end_line>
But I'ma show you how deep into these streets I get<end_line>

See what this game made, and *of age I came*<end_line>
And you up and coming rappers know you young to this game<end_line>
*I went from Marcy to Hollywood, I'm back again*<end_line>
I don't need no applaud, to clap again<end_line>
Let alone, no award, from rap to win<end_line>
Talk drama, get yourself wrapped up in<end_line>
Severe head trauma, get beat with the nine lime-a<end_line>
Cut your hand off if you fuckin with my product<end_line>
That slayed shit, I'm on the grave shift<end_line>
We all know fucked up money don't pay rent<end_line>
You short with my ones, you short one thumb<end_line>
You can't, come up short where the fuck I'm from<end_line>
We got, dues to pay, new tools to spray<end_line>
Who's to say, Bleek won't make news today<end_line>
You know the ooze'll spray if you refuse to pay<end_line>
And I move the yae nigga day by day<end_line>
