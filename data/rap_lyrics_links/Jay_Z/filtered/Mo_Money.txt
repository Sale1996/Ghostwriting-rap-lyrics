<verse_start>
That nigga let his fuckin flow go<end_line>
Niggaz tryin to switch up the flows on niggaz<end_line>
Hit niggaz, slip niggaz with a micky<end_line>
Drop that joint<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Pull up on the block in the alien gray Bentley<end_line>
Full of sport modes, you never could hang with me<end_line>
Just to get in early, I paid a extra 50<end_line>
Gettin that money my nigga<end_line>
Oh-five Chrysler, trees for the blunts<end_line>
Three hoes in the back, two fiends in the front<end_line>
Twenty-two inch shoes, CV's in the trunk<end_line>
Gettin that money my nigga<end_line>
Makin dough off a style I be the best in<end_line>
Glad to be down with these two livin legends<end_line>
Now let me see which league I'ma invest in<end_line>
Gettin that money my nigga<end_line>
Rollin this cheer, put the niggaz in fear<end_line>
Makin bitches shed tears, take a look at my career<end_line>
Now the shit's swell; when I get up to 70 in the Coupe<end_line>
Peep the wing when I hop out the tail - tell 'em Kel<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Gettin this money switchin my whips and my kicks<end_line>
Like I'm just addicted to difference you pick what you want from me<end_line>
To be a, lame with visions of riches, enter my brain<end_line>
Like I picture myself in deep dishes, just switchin lanes<end_line>
It's just insane, is it?  I'm from the district where niggaz<end_line>
either in prison or pay visits like in-laws<end_line>
So we fend for ourself, and the wealth is in raw<end_line>
We can't help but been lost, what else gon' make that engine roar?<end_line>
Lay back in 745, big boy cars, that's all we drive<end_line>
Into the club we get all the eyes when you gettin that money my nigga<end_line>
<verse_end>
