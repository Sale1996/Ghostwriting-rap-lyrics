Yeah; so what if you flip a couple words?<end_line>
I could triple that in birds<end_line>
open your mind you see the circus in the sky<end_line>
I'm Ringling Brothers Barnum & Bailey with the pies<end_line>
No matter how you slice it I'm your motherfuckin guy<end_line>
Just like a b-boy with 360 waves<end_line>
Do the same with the pot, still come back beige<end_line>
Whether right or southpaw, whether pot or the jar<end_line>
Whip it around - it still come back hard<end_line>
So easily do I W-H-I-P<end_line>
My repitition with wrists'll bring you kilo figures<end_line>
I got creole C.O. bitches for my niggaz<end_line>

You already know what the business is<end_line>
Unnecessary commissary boy we live this shit<end_line>
Niggaz wanna bring the 80s back<end_line>
That's okay with me, that's where they made me at<end_line>
Except I don't write on the wall<end_line>
I write my name in the history books, hustle in the hall<end_line>
Nah, I don't spin on my head <end_line>
I spin work in the pots so I can spend my bread<end_line>

It's '87 state of mind that I'm in<end_line>
In my prime, so for that time, I'm Rakim<end_line>
If it wasn't for the crime that I was in<end_line>
But I wouldn't be the guy whose rhymes it is that I'm in<end_line>
No pain, no profit, P I repeat if you show me where the pot is<end_line>
Cherry M3's with the top back<end_line>
Red and green G's all on my hat<end_line>
North beach leathers, matching Gucci sweater<end_line>
Gucci sneaks on to keep my outfit together<end_line>
Whatever, hundred for the diamond chain<end_line>
Can't you tell that I came from the dope game<end_line>
Blame Reagan for making me into a monster<end_line>
Blame Oliver North and Iran-Contra<end_line>
I ran contraband that they sponsored<end_line>
Before this rhymin stuff we was in concert<end_line>

Pushmoney over broads, you got it, fuck Bush<end_line>
Chef, guess what I cooked<end_line>
Baked a lot of bread and kept it off the books <end_line>
Rockstar, look, way before the bars my picture was getting took<end_line>
Feds, they like whack rappers<end_line>
Tried as they may, couldn't get me on the hook<end_line>
D.A. wanna indict me<end_line>
Cause fish scales in my veins like a pisces<end_line>
The pyrex pot, rolled up my sleeves<end_line>
Turn one into two like a Siamese<end_line>
Twin when it end, I'm a stand as a man never dyin or admirin these<end_line>
Last of a dyin breed, so let the champagne pop<end_line>
I partied for a while now I'm back to the block<end_line>
