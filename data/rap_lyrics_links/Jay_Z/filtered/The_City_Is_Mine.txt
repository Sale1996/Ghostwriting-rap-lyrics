<verse_start>
Uhh, yeah<end_line>
What the deal playboy, just rest your soul<end_line>
I be holding it down yo still love the dough<end_line>
Got these ladies on the cock now you know how we go<end_line>
Got the whole world on lock down you know how we flow<end_line>
Don't worry about Brooklyn I continue to flame<end_line>
Therefore a world with amnesia won't forget your name<end_line>
You held it down long enough, let me take those reigns<end_line>
And just like your spirit the commision remains<end_line>
Niggaz can cross the T's and, dots the I's<end_line>
Now that I got too popular to cop them pies<end_line>
I'm takin this rap shit serious, to my demise<end_line>
Jay shit's like cake mix, watch me rise<end_line>
Basics in the basement, waste it<end_line>
Asking my dog for advice so when he can't say shit<end_line>
my hatred is, fueled just give me a sign<end_line>
And I let the world know that the city is mine, what?<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Y'all want to know how I flow just seek and you find<end_line>
I'm like a brain in the voicebox, I speak my mind<end_line>
About to redefine rap mami, either I'm<end_line>
the illest nigga doing it or these niggaz is losin it<end_line>
I read a article that said I was ruinin shit<end_line>
But every time I look, I'm movin units in quick<end_line>
So I'ma hit y'all, with these last two and split<end_line>
and leave niggaz with nothing but my influences-es<end_line>
Soon it's the Jigga, I ain't mad yeah, bite my shit<end_line>
Sell half of what I sell because it's not quite my shit<end_line>
I'm the type to buy a Roley and just ice my shit<end_line>
on the spot, fuck comin back twice to shit<end_line>
How real is that?  My floss game, still intact<end_line>
Boss game, you lame dudes can't feel that<end_line>
Like the first dude to cop the 850 and 89<end_line>
and drove it up to 55th, the city is mine, what?<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I snatch your girl cause your arm ain't strong enough<end_line>
Plus ya don't stay in the studio long enough<end_line>
I make hits while y'all stay hatin and take bricks<end_line>
Had it locked til I came in the club, Take 6<end_line>
Got your chick cause you swore she was innocent<end_line>
Got her a Chinese manicure hair done by Dominicans, all for what<end_line>
So I could be in a dark corner, all in the butt<end_line>
at the bar alchoholing her up<end_line>
I represent the lifestyle of those who thirst cream<end_line>
A buck fifty a shot, Louis the Thirteenth<end_line>
Jay-Z, Roc-A-Fella yo, know the name<end_line>
I ain't a player get it right, I'm controllin the game<end_line>
From now until they blow holes in my frame<end_line>
I'ma stand firm, holdin my aim, feel me?<end_line>
I'm the focal, point like Biggie in his prime<end_line>
on the low though - shhhhh, the city is mine!<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Chorus w/ variations to end<end_line>
<verse_end>
