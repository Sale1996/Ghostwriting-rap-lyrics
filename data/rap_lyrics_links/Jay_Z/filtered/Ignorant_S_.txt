When them tops come down, chicks tops come down<end_line>
Like when them shots come out, make cops come around<end_line>
When them blocks come out I can wake up a small town<end_line>
Finish off the block then I make my mall rounds<end_line>
Stares get exchanged then the fifth come out<end_line>
The tough guy disappear, then the bitch come out<end_line>
"That's him!" I'm usually what they whisper 'bout<end_line>
Either what chick he with, or his chip amount<end_line>
Cause I been doin' this since C*H*I*P*S was out<end_line>
Watchin Erik Estrada, baggin up at the Ramada<end_line>
Table full of powder, AC broke<end_line>
'Bout to take another shower on my twenty-fifth hour<end_line>
Spike Lee's everywhere, game on the flight<end_line>
You might see me anywhere, day in the life<end_line>
Only thing changed the tail number on the flight<end_line>
I can touch down and take off the same night<end_line>

They're all actors<end_line>
Lookin at themselves in the mirror backwards<end_line>
Can't even face themselves, don't fear no rappers<end_line>
They're all weirdos, DeNiros in practice<end_line>
So don't believe everything your earlobe captures; it's mostly backwards<end_line>
Unless it happens to be as accurate as me<end_line>
And everything said in song you happen to see<end_line>
Then, actually, believe half of what you see<end_line>
None of what you hear, even if it's spat by me<end_line>
And with that said, I will kill niggaz dead<end_line>
Cut niggaz short, give you wheels for legs<end_line>
I'm a K-I-double-L-E-R<end_line>
See y'all in Hell, shoot niggaz straight through the E.R.<end_line>
Whoa~! This ain't B.R., no<end_line>
This S.C. CEO, the next Lyor, no<end_line>
The next leader of the whole free world<end_line>
And the first thing I'ma do is free Sigel, go<end_line>

I missed the part when it stopped bein 'bout Imus<end_line>
What do my lyrics got to do with this shit!<end_line>
"Scarface" the movie did more than Scarface the rapper to me<end_line>
So that ain't to blame for all the shit that's happened to me<end_line>
Are you sayin what I'm spittin<end_line>
Is worse than these celebrataunts showin they kittin, you kiddin!<end_line>
Let's stop the bullshittin<end_line>
'Til we all without sin, let's quit the pulpittin<end_line>
"Scarface" the movie did more than Scarface the rapper to me<end_line>
So that ain't to blame for all the shit that's happened to me<end_line>
Now stop the bullshittin<end_line>
'Til we all without sin, let's quit the pulpittin<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
It's only entertainment! Hehehe<end_line>
