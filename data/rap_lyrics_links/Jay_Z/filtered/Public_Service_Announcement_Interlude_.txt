Allow me to re-introduce myself<end_line>
My name is Hov', OH, H-to-the-O-V<end_line>
I used to move snowflakes by the O-Z<end_line>
I guess even back then you can call me<end_line>
CEO of the R-O-C, Hov'!<end_line>
Fresh out the fryin pan into the fire<end_line>
I be the, music biz number one supplier<end_line>
Flyer/flier than a piece of paper bearin my name<end_line>
Got the hottest chick in the game wearin my chain, that's right<end_line>
Hov', OH - not D.O.C.<end_line>
But similar to them letters, "No One Can Do it Better"<end_line>
I check cheddar like a food inspector<end_line>
My homey Strict told me, "Dude finish your breakfast"<end_line>
So that's what I'ma do, take you back to the dude<end_line>
with the Lexus, fast-forward the jewels and the necklace<end_line>
Let me tell you dudes what I do to protect this<end_line>
I shoot at you actors like movie directors<end_line>
This ain't a movie dog<end_line>
<verse_end>

"Now before I finish, let me just say<end_line>
 I did not come here to show out, did not come here to impress you<end_line>
 Because to tell you the truth when I leave here I'm GONE!<end_line>
 And I don't care WHAT you think about me - but just remember,<end_line>
 when it hits the fan brother, whether it's next year, ten years, <end_line>
 twenty years from now, you'll never be able to say<end_line>
 that these brothers lied to you JACK!"<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Ving ain't lie<end_line>
I done came through the block in everything that's fly<end_line>
I'm like, Che Guevara with bling on, I'm complex<end_line>
I never claimed to have wings on<end_line>
Nigga I get mine - by any means on whenever there's a drought<end_line>
Get your umbrellas out because, that's when I brainstorm<end_line>
You can blame Shawn, but I ain't invent the game<end_line>
I just rolled the dice, tryin to get some change<end_line>
And I do it twice, ain't no sense in me<end_line>
lyin as if, I am a different man<end_line>
And I could blame my environment but<end_line>
there ain't no reason why I be buyin expensive chains<end_line>
Hope you don't think users are the only abusers<end_line>
Niggaz, gettin high within the game<end_line>
If you do then, how would you explain?<end_line>
I'm ten years removed, still the vibe is in my veins<end_line>
I got a hustler spirit, nigga period<end_line>
Check out my hat yo, peep the way I wear it<end_line>
Check out my swag' yo, I walk like a ballplayer<end_line>
No matter where you go, you are what you are player<end_line>
And you can try to change but that's just the top layer<end_line>
Man, you was who you was 'fore you got here<end_line>
Only God can judge me, so I'm gone<end_line>
Either love me, or leave me alone<end_line>
