<verse_start>
We mastered this, don't you know<end_line>
I eat +Ether+ and breathe acid, weak bastards<end_line>
We copped and we crash it<end_line>
Then we cop again cause we are classic<end_line>
Let me speak for ya R we "Scarface" re-enacted<end_line>
"The Godfather" trilogy re-casted<end_line>
But it's real like we grievin for Aaliyah with the masses<end_line>
But I hope my boy Dash get to see it when he passes<end_line>
I feel her soul when the Lee passes<end_line>
When the wind blows, it's almost like I see her in the Hamptons<end_line>
Even more reason to be up in them mansions<end_line>
Laid back, feet up in the hammock, I'ma live for ya<end_line>
Big too, 'til they put me in the grave<end_line>
I'ma floss 'til they toss me a Bed-Stuy parade<end_line>
'Til Chi-Town make a nigga Mayor for a day<end_line>
In the memory of Joanne Kelly, let us pray<end_line>
