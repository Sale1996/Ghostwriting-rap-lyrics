Lord forgive him, he got them dark forces in him<end_line>
But he also got a righteous cause for sinnin<end_line>
Them-a-murder me, so I gotta murder-dem<end_line>
First emergency, doctors performin procedures<end_line>
Jesus, I ain't tryin to be facetious, but<end_line>
"Vengeance is mine" said the Lord<end_line>
You said it better than all<end_line>
Leave niggaz on death's door, breathin on<end_line>
res-por-rators for killin my best, poor haters<end_line>
On permanent, hi-atus as I skate<end_line>
in the Maybach Benz, flyer than Sanaa Lathan<end_line>
Pumpin "Brown Sugar" by D'Angelo<end_line>
In Los Angeles, like an evangelist<end_line>
I can introduce you to your maker<end_line>
Bring you closer to nature<end_line>
Ashes after they cremate you bastards<end_line>
Hope you been readin your Psalms and chapters<end_line>
Payin your tithe, bein good Catholics, I'm comin<end_line>

Yes, this is holy war<end_line>
I wet y'all all with the holy water<end_line>
Spray from Heckler-Koch auto-<end_line>
matic all the static, shall cease to exist<end_line>
like a sabbatical, I throw couple at you, take six!<end_line>
Spread love, to all of my dead thugs<end_line>
I pour out a little Louis, to a head above<end_line>
Yessir, and when I perish, the meek shall inherit the earth<end_line>
'Til that time, it's on and poppin, CHURCH<end_line>
Like Don Bishop, the fifth or palm cock either<end_line>
Lift up your soul or give you the holy ghost<end_line>
Please I leave you in somebody's cathedral<end_line>
for stuntin like Evel Knievel<end_line>
I let you see where that bright light lead you<end_line>
The more you talk, the more you irkin us<end_line>
The more you gon' need memorial services<end_line>
"The Black Album" second verse, is like<end_line>
Devil's pie, save some dessert for us<end_line>

<verse_start>
Let me get serious for y'all, one second<end_line>
I got dreams, of holdin a nine milla, to Bob's killer<end_line>
Askin him why as my eyes fill up<end_line>
These days I can't wake up with a dry pillow<end_line>
Gone but not forgotten, homes I still feel you<end_line>
So, curse the day that birthed the bastard<end_line>
who caused your church mass, reverts to crash<end_line>
The first to blast then reverse the curse<end_line>
The first to date and there you are, Bobalob<end_line>
Lord forgive him, we all have sinned<end_line>
But Bob's a good dude, please let him in<end_line>
And if you feel in my heart that I long for revenge<end_line>
Please blame it on the son of the mornin', thanks again<end_line>
