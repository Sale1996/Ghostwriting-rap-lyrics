Uh, yeah.. ay, this a, special dedication<end_line>
I wanna thank you for the fuel, no really thank you<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I felt so inspired by what my teacher said<end_line>
Said I'd either be dead or be a reefer head<end_line>
Now sure if that's how adults should speak to kids<end_line>
Especially when the only thing I did was speak in class - I'll teach his ass<end_line>
Even betters what my uncle did<end_line>
I popped my demo tape in, started to beat my head<end_line>
Peaked out my eye, see if he was beatin' his<end_line>
He might as well say "beat it kid, he's on the list!"<end_line>
It's like I'm searchin' for kicks like a sneaker head<end_line>
He gon keep pushin' me until I reach the ledge<end_line>
And when I reach the ledge I'll tell 'em all to eat a dick<end_line>
Take a leap of faith and let my eagle wings spread, spread, spread<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
was them tellin' me what I could not be, oh well<end_line>
Hey! Hey!<end_line>
I'm so ambitiousI might hit two sisters<end_line>
Hey I'm on a missionNo matter what the conditions<end_line>
Forget the personal issueswhen you been what I been through<end_line>
Hey if you believe itthen you could conceive it<end_line>
Yeah, yeah, yeah<end_line>
<verse_end>

I had to lace up my boots even harder<end_line>
Father is too far away to father; further-more all the <end_line>
kids either, smoke reefer or either <end_line>
move white; there's few writers in my cypher<end_line>
So they made light of, my type of<end_line>
dreams seem dumb, they said "wise up!"<end_line>
How many guys-a, you see makin it from here?<end_line>
The world don't like us, is that not clear? Alright but<end_line>
I'm different, I can't base what I'm gon' be<end_line>
offa what everybody isn't, they don't listen<end_line>
Just whisperin behind my back<end_line>
No vision, lack of ambition, so whack!<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Had a couple of meetings, no offers yet<end_line>
Maybe I ain't good enough for these offices<end_line>
Back to the drawin' board, duckin' officers<end_line>
It's all good cause the streets is A&R'in' this<end_line>
So with or without, any of your involvement<end_line>
We comin' for all of this, respect my conglomerate<end_line>
I went from pauper to the President<end_line>
Every deal I made set precedent<end_line>
Niggas thought I'd fall without old buddy<end_line>
Oh buddy, what I do is make more money<end_line>
Dear Teacher, your probably somewhere near a speaker<end_line>
I'm ballin' outta control, can you hear my sneakers<end_line>
Fuck y'all~!<end_line>
