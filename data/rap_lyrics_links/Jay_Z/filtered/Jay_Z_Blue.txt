Let's do this for these babies<end_line>
Mercedes, truck, fuck, houses on acres<end_line>
Blatant ballin on HD<end_line>
Mm, y'all need to step up y'all AV<end_line>
Mm, life changed again<end_line>
I was already takin off, my flight changed again<end_line>
Slight change of winds<end_line>
It's barely 12 noon and my wife changed again<end_line>
Baby need Pampers<end_line>
Daddy need at least three weeks in the Hamptons<end_line>
Please don't judge me<end_line>
Only hugged the block, I thought my daddy didn't love me<end_line>
My baby gettin chubby<end_line>
Cue that Stevie Wonder music, aww +Isn't She Lovely+?<end_line>
Now I'm starin at her, prayin that things don't get ugly<end_line>
And I'm stuck in that old cycle like wife leaves hubby<end_line>
Fuck joint custody<end_line>
I need a joint right now, just the thought alone fucks with me<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I dream filthy<end_line>
mixed me with Jamaican<end_line>
Uh, what a set off<end_line>
And I know I'm not perfect baby<end_line>
I done been through so much trauma it gon' be hard to reverse it<end_line>
With some doctors and some nurses maybe<end_line>
Teach me how to treat a lady, open doors on the 'cedes<end_line>
This relationship shit is complicated<end_line>
All I know is we ain't speakin every day, I fuckin hate it<end_line>
And, I don't wanna duplicate it<end_line>
I done seen my mom and pop drive each other muh'fuckin crazy<end_line>
And I got that nigga blood in me<end_line>
I got his ego and his temper, all that's missin is the drugs in me<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Father never taught me how to be a father, treat a mother<end_line>
I don't wanna have to just repeat another, leave another<end_line>
baby with no daddy, want no mama drama, I just wanna<end_line>
take her back to a time when everything was calmer<end_line>
Out in Paris on the terrace watchin the Eiffel Tower<end_line>
and the Ferris wheel, yet and still nothin could prepare us<end_line>
for the beauty that you be, Blue be<end_line>
Lookin in your eyes is like a mirror, have to face my fears<end_line>
Cheer up, why can't you just be happy<end_line>
without these back and forth thoughts? You too much like your daddy<end_line>
Badly I just wanted to spent more time with him<end_line>
Sadly life wouldn't let me get around with him<end_line>
Now I got my own daughter, taught her how to take her first steps<end_line>
Cut the cord, watch her take her first breath<end_line>
And I'm tryin and I'm lyin if I said I wasn't scared<end_line>
But in life or death if I ain't here<end_line>
Apologies in order, to Blue Ivy my daughter<end_line>
If it was up to me, you would be with me<end_line>
Sort of like Daddy Dearest<end_line>
