I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves<end_line>
I was goin' do it with the flow, but they did it with their sales<end_line>
I was goin' 9/11 'em, but they didn't need the help<end_line>
And they did a good job them boys is talented as hell<end_line>
Cause not only did they brick they put a building up as well<end_line>
They ran a plane into that building and when that building fell<end_line>
Ran to the crash site with no masks and inhaled<end_line>
Toxins deep inside their lungs until both of them was filled<end_line>
Blew a cloud out like a L into a jar then took a smell<end_line>
Cause they heard that second hand smoke kills<end_line>
Niggas thought they was ill found out they was, EWW<end_line>
And it's like you knew exactly how I wanted you to feel<end_line>
