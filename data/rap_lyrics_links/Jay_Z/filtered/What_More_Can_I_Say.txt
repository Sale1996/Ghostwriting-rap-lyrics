There's never been a nigga this good for this long<end_line>
This hood, or this pop, this hot, or this strong<end_line>
With so many different flows there's one for this song<end_line>
The next one I switch up, this one will get bit up<end_line>
These fucks, too lazy to make up shit, they crazy<end_line>
They don't, paint pictures, they just, trace me<end_line>
You know what?  Soon they forget where they plucked<end_line>
they whole style from, they try to reverse the outcome<end_line>
I'm like - TOUGH!<end_line>
I'm not a biter I'm a writer for myself and others<end_line>
I say a B.I.G. verse, I'm only biggin up my brother<end_line>
Biggin up my borough, I'm big enough to do it<end_line>
I'm that thorough, plus I know my own flow is foolish<end_line>
So them rings and things you sing about, bring 'em out<end_line>
It's hard to yell when the bar-rell's in your mouth<end_line>
I'm in - new sneakers, dual-seaters<end_line>
Few divas, what more can I tell you?<end_line>
Let me spell it for you<end_line>
Double-U I, double-L, I-E<end_line>
Nobody truer than, H-O-V<end_line>
And I'm back for more, New York's ambassador<end_line>
Prime Minister, back to finish my business up<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
You already know what I'm about, flyin birds down South<end_line>
Movin wet off the step, "Purple Rain" in a drought<end_line>
Stuntin on hoes; brushin off my shirt<end_line>
But ain't nuttin on my clothes 'cept my chain, my name<end_line>
Young H-O pitch the yay faithful<end_line>
Even if they patrol I make payroll<end_line>
Benz paid fo', friends they roll<end_line>
Private jets down to Turks and Caicos<end_line>
Crist' caseloads, I don't give a shit<end_line>
Nigga one life to live, I can't let a day go<end_line>
by without me bein fly or fresh to death<end_line>
Head to toe 'til the day I rest<end_line>
And I don't wear jerseys, I'm thirty plus<end_line>
Give me a crisp pair of jeans, nigga button up<end_line>
S. Dots on my feet make my cipher complete<end_line>
What more can I say?  Guru play the beat!<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
We gon' let this ride into the hook<end_line>
- I'ma snap my fingers on this one<end_line>
What more can I say to you?<end_line>
- Get my grown man on<end_line>
LET'S GO!<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Now you know yo' ass is Willie when they got you in the mag<end_line>
for like half a billy, and yo' ass ain't lily<end_line>
white that mean that shit you write must be illy<end_line>
Either that or your flow is silly - it's both<end_line>
I don't mean to boast, but damn if I don't brag<end_line>
Them crackers gon' act like I ain't on they ass<end_line>
The Martha Stewart, that's far from Jewish<end_line>
Far from a Harvard student, just had the balls to do it<end_line>
And no I'm not through with it<end_line>
In fact, I'm just previewin it<end_line>
This ain't the show, I'm just EQ'n it<end_line>
One-two and I won't stop abusin it<end_line>
To groupie girls, stop false accusin it<end_line>
Back to the music - the Maybach roof is translucent<end_line>
Niggaz got a problem Houston!  Heh<end_line>
What up B, they can't shut up me<end_line>
Shut down I, not even P.E., I'ma ride<end_line>
God forgive me for my brash delivery<end_line>
But I remember vividly what these streets did to me<end_line>
So picture me lettin these clowns nitpick at me<end_line>
Paint me like a pickany<end_line>
I will literally kiss T.T. in the forehead<end_line>
Tell her please forgive me then squeeze until you full 'head<end_line>
I'm not the one to score points off, in fact<end_line>
I got a joint that'll knock yo' points off<end_line>
Young, Hova the God, nigga blasphemy<end_line>
I'm at the Trump International, ask for me<end_line>
I ain't never scared, I'm everywhere you ain't never there<end_line>
And nigga, why would I ever care?<end_line>
Pound for pound I'm the best to ever come around here<end_line>
Excludin nobody, look what I embody<end_line>
The soul of a hustler, I really ran the street<end_line>
A CEO's mind, that marketin plan was me<end_line>
And no I ain't get shot up a whole bunch of times<end_line>
Or make up shit in a whole bunch of lines<end_line>
And I ain't animated like say I +Busta Rhymes+<end_line>
But the real shit you get when you bust down my lines<end_line>
Add that to the fact I went plat' a bunch of times<end_line>
Times that by my influence on pop culture<end_line>
I'm supposed to be number one on everybody list<end_line>
We'll see what happens when I no longer exist<end_line>
Fuck this!<end_line>
