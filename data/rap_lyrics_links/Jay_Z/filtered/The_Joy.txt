...This is my momma shit<end_line>
I used to hear this through the walls in the hood<end_line>
when I was back on my pa-jama shit<end_line>
Afros and marijuana sticks <end_line>
Seeds and the ganjas had it poppin like the sample that I'm rhymin with<end_line>
Pete Rock, let the needle drop<end_line>
I seen so much as a kid, they surprised I don't needle pop<end_line>
Takin sips of pop, six packs of, Pink Champale<end_line>
Ballentine L, Ballys on my feet help me balance out well<end_line>
That and the shit I used to balance on a scale<end_line>
I got it honest from the parties from my momma's<end_line>
Virgin Marys try to judge her, I'm like, "Where the Madonnas now?"<end_line>
Give all glory to Gloria, they said<end_line>
"You raised that boy too fast", but you was raising a warrior<end_line>
We victorious, they'll never take the joy from us<end_line>
