Had a dream I said, bout who he said?<end_line>
Bout B.I.G. I said, that's big he said<end_line>
Dig what he said, proceed he said<end_line>
Indeed I said, so - breathe I did<end_line>
Don't repeat what I say I said, he said nothin<end_line>
He agreed with his head, he just nodded like this<end_line>
What I believe to be a yes I re-peated what was said<end_line>
It came to me like a .. well last evenin I said<end_line>
"You feel playboy," was the greeting he said<end_line>
First thing I wanted to know, what's the reason he was dead?<end_line>
"More money, more problems, better believe it," he said<end_line>
"Careful what you wish for you might receive it," he said<end_line>
I see I said, jealousy I said<end_line>
Got the whole industry mad at me I said<end_line>
Then B.I. said, "Hov' remind yourself<end_line>
nobody built like you, you designed yourself"<end_line>
I agree I said, my one of a kind self<end_line>
Get stoned every day like Jesus did<end_line>
What he said, I said, has been said before<end_line>
"Just keep doin your thing," he said, say no more<end_line>
