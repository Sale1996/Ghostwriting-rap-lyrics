That's right<end_line>
Uh-huh-uh, it was all good just a week ago<end_line>
Last week I had everything<end_line>
Uh, uh-huh-uh, had this all good just a week ago<end_line>
I had the money.. had the cars, the bitches<end_line>
Uh-huh, yeah, it was all good just a week ago<end_line>
and the jewelry..<end_line>
	and then my motherfuckin niggaz started snitchin<end_line>
Uh-huh, uh uh, yo<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Growin up in the hood just my dog and me<end_line>
We used to hustle in the hood for, all to see<end_line>
Problems, I called on him, he called on me<end_line>
We wasn't quite partners, I hit him off my P<end_line>
Met him unlocked doors, off my keys<end_line>
Yeah we spoke, much more than cordially<end_line>
Man he broke bread with me, my business spread swiftly<end_line>
The Feds came to get me, we both fled quickly<end_line>
Wasn't quick enough to jump over the hedges with me<end_line>
Got caught, and that's when our relationship strayed<end_line>
Used to call me from the joint til he ran out of change<end_line>
And when he called collect and I heard his name<end_line>
I quickly accepted, but when I reached the phone<end_line>
he's talkin reckless, I can sense deceit in his tone<end_line>
I said, "Damn dawg, what, nine weeks and you're home?"<end_line>
He said, "Main man, you think shit's sweet cause you're home."<end_line>
I just sat, spat no more speech in the phone<end_line>
The crackers up there bleachin your dome, you're reachin<end_line>
I said, "The world don't stop I've got to keep keep on."<end_line>
From there I sensed the beef was on<end_line>
I ran to the spy store to add some more features on my phone<end_line>
To see if I had bugs and leeches on my phone<end_line>
Can't be too safe cause niggaz is two-faced<end_line>
And they show the other side when they catch a new case<end_line>
It's on<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Like I put the toast to your head and made you sell<end_line>
We both came in this game, blind as hell<end_line>
I did a little better, had more clientele<end_line>
Told you put away some cheddar now you cryin for bail<end_line>
Seventeen and I'm holdin on to around a mill<end_line>
I could bail out and blow trial and come around on the pill<end_line>
Had niggaz thinkin I was from Uptown for real<end_line>
I had so much hustle plus I was down to ill<end_line>
Like a Brooklyn nigga, straight out of Brownsville<end_line>
Down and dirty, down to fight the round thirty<end_line>
Freezin on them corners still holdin my crack<end_line>
Lookin up and down the block, the fuck is the dough at?<end_line>
Came from flat broke to lettin the dough stack<end_line>
You tell them feds I said I'm never goin back<end_line>
I'm from Marcy, and Marcy don't raise no rats<end_line>
You know the consequences of your acts, you can't be serious<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
The lawyer I retained you said you leakin some things<end_line>
All this after a week in the bang<end_line>
I'm mad at myself cause I didn't spot the weak and lame<end_line>
I woulda bet the house you wouldn't speak a thang<end_line>
Nigga this was the oath, to the top of broke<end_line>
Even pricked our finger, anything that got between us<end_line>
we sposed to cock the ninas, what happened to that?<end_line>
Instead you copped out to a misdemeanor<end_line>
Fuck it, the same thing make you laugh make you cry<end_line>
That's right, the same game that make you mad could make you die<end_line>
It's a dice game, and sometimes you crap<end_line>
Who woulda thought you'd get popped one time and rap?<end_line>
Now you know that's bad when your sister is mad<end_line>
and your son gotta grow up like, "This is my dad?"<end_line>
The labelling of a snitch is a lifetime scar<end_line>
You'll always be in jail nigga, just minus the bars<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
You rat bastard!<end_line>
<verse_end>
