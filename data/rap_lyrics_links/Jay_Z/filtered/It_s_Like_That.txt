As a young'un dumbin, gun in the waist<end_line>
Sold crack to those who couldn't take the pain<end_line>
And had to numb it with base<end_line>
Couldn't drink the Henny straight, I needed somethin to chase <end_line>
Nowadays I throw shots back, leavin nuttin to waste<end_line>
Life's like a treadmill, niggas runnin in place<end_line>
Gettin nowhere fast, a whole year done past<end_line>
I vowed to never stop winnin, 'til the earth stop spinnin<end_line>
Rock hot linen, cop hot cars and hot women<end_line>
If it's not him then you got it confused, y'all not rememberin<end_line>
My motto is simply I will not lose<end_line>
Abide by the block rules, I buy my glocks used<end_line>
wit bodies on it, let me know anybody want it?<end_line>
I'm raised, illrational, way misunderstood<end_line>
If you ain't live like I live, been one with the hood<end_line>
I done what I could, to come up with this paper 'til this day still<end_line>
Run with the hood, guess it's part of my nature<end_line>
If hell awaits a, nigga I'm comin with the razors<end_line>
Still flashin ya shit, try to pass me in a six<end_line>
Type classy on the wrists, every bit of 30 karats<end_line>
This is, not a game this is not why I came<end_line>
May these words find a spot on your brain and burn<end_line>
Then I recycle my life I shall return<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I'm a hop skip and a jump from grippin the pump<end_line>
Spittin a couple of curse words, and hittin you chump<end_line>
Shit, I get digits in lumps<end_line>
I'm a motherfuckin problem, is this what you want?<end_line>
Overachiever, I love chicks that puff cheeba in reefer paper<end_line>
I hate the ones that blow up ya beeper<end_line>
Cause I, go in ya deeper, I only bone divas<end_line>
Impregnate the world when I "cum" through your speakers<end_line>
Fuck hot, my records got the fever<end_line>
Niggas kick dirt, get ya whole block sweeped up<end_line>
I creep up when the beef heats up<end_line>
Caught him with his feet up and shoes off, bout to snooze off<end_line>
Hatin, cause you can't turn the booze off<end_line>
You dudes is too soft, why I don't fuck with you all<end_line>
I might bark with X, or spit at the Lox<end_line>
But, other than that, I don't be fuckin with cats<end_line>
Just me Ty and B.I., thug it like that<end_line>
E, Dame and Biggs, what's fuckin with that?<end_line>
Y'all can never diss Jigga, get nothin for that<end_line>
Other than a couple of slugs in ya back<end_line>
Rappers y'all, runnin around like I won't gun ya down<end_line>
Last nigga that fronted, two shots spun him around<end_line>
Lord, accept this offerin here's somethin for your crown<end_line>
I admit no malice, I just met his challenge and won<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Girls and guns, all I want<end_line>
stock exchange, rocks and thangs<end_line>
