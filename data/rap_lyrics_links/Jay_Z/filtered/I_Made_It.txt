Out in BK where<end_line>
It aint everyday that you make it out<end_line>
Be on top of yachts waving<end_line>
I remember you saving for the light bill paid the rent with the light bill<end_line>
Now our crib dark as a basement<end_line>
Had to lock up the phone when you wasn't home<end_line>
We was communicating like the money you made wasn't basic<end_line>
Our cable was basic no HBO WHT just Ralph Mcdames on the station<end_line>
I aggravated you for Atari and Colico vision pin stripe Lee's<end_line>
When the first day of school came in<end_line>
I was ok with not having everything<end_line>
long as Saturdays you had the commodores playing<end_line>
The expression on your face was priceless<end_line>
Still with me till this day baby girl I won't erase it<end_line>
I go to my grave with the memory of the sacrifice you made<end_line>
You deserve a standing ovation<end_line>

So I act like your husband and I'm only your son<end_line>
I told you one day I'd get you a home<end_line>
I didn't know it could possibly be in Rome<end_line>
Told me don't wait on nobody get your own<end_line>
