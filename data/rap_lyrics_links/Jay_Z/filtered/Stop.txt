<verse_start>
It's Young... uh, mack alone, I'm back in the zone<end_line>
I'm out they way, still these rappers won't leave me alone<end_line>
I can give a fuck what these rappers sayin' bout me<end_line>
That just let's me know, they can't go a day without me<end_line>
Scared of me succeading, that's the reason you doubt me<end_line>
Cuz if you ain't believe me, you wouldn't be thinkin' bout me<end_line>
Sorta how like you, never crossed my mind<end_line>
Until you crossed the line, stop...<end_line>
Then I gotta come accross a rhyme<end_line>
To let the world know you come across a mime<end_line>
I do so much sauce with lines, with someone who saws my climb<end_line>
From Marcy to party, where you soakin' up blue nine<end_line>
Prude, am I, got a du-lema, I'm a dude from the hood<end_line>
Who loves jewels, who am I?<end_line>
You where placed in the same shoes, size 10/5<end_line>
With a sick view, of the place you grew, dude, can I<end_line>
Live, what I did, for this whole rap circus<end_line>
I open up more doors for y'all fuckers than car service<end_line>
Ya'll nervous, I ain't back yet<end_line>
I'm on extended vaca', I ain't unpack yet, stop worrying<end_line>
<verse_end>
