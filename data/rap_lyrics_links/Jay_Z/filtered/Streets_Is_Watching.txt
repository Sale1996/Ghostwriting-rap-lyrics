Look, if I shoot you, I'm brainless<end_line>
But if you shoot me, then you're famous -- what's a n*gga to do?<end_line>
When the, streets is watching, blocks keep clocking<end_line>
Waiting for you to break, make your first mistake<end_line>
Can't ignore it, that's the fastest way to get extorted<end_line>
But my time is money, at twenty-five, I can't afford it<end_line>
Beef is sorted like Godiva, chocolates<end_line>
N*ggaz you bought it, I pull the slide back and cock it<end_line>
Plan aborted, you and your mans get a pass<end_line>
This rhyme, you're operating on f*ck time<end_line>
Y'all n*ggaz ain't worth my shells, all y'all n*ggaz<end_line>
tryin to do is hurt my sales, and stop trips to John McNale<end_line>
The type to start a beef then, run to the cops<end_line>
When I see you in the street got, one in the drop<end_line>
When I'd rather be on tour gettin a, hundred a pop<end_line>
Taking pictures with some b*tches, in front of the drop<end_line>
The streets is watching<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Now it's hard not to kill n*ggaz<end_line>
It's like a full time job not to kill n*ggaz, can't chill<end_line>
the streets is watchin.. when you froze your arms<end_line>
N*ggaz wanna test you and your gun goes warm<end_line>
Can't get caught with your feet up, gotta keep your heat up<end_line>
Sweet n*ggaz running 'round swearing sh*t is sweeter<end_line>
Once you're tagged lame the game is follow the leader<end_line>
Everybody want a piece of your scrilla, so you gotta keep it realer<end_line>
Kidnap n*ggaz wanna steal ya<end_line>
Broke n*ggaz want no cash, they just wanna kill ya<end_line>
for the name, n*ggaz don't know the rules<end_line>
Disrespectin the game, want you to blow your cool<end_line>
Force your hand, of course that man's plottin<end_line>
Smarten up, the streets is watchin, it's on<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
My street mentality flip bricks forever, know me and money<end_line>
we like armed co-defendants, n*gga we stick together<end_line>
Sh*t whatever for this cheddar ran my game into the ground<end_line>
Hustle harder to see it if indictment time came around<end_line>
And you can look up and down the streets and I can't be found<end_line>
Put in twenty-four hour shifts but, that ain't me now<end_line>
Got a face too easy to trace, n*ggaz mouths got slow leaks<end_line>
Had to hide between my workers, couldn't play those streets<end_line>
She out of space like Mercury you jerkin me?  Hectic<end_line>
Had to call upon my wolves to send, n*ggaz the message<end_line>
I said this: 'Let's play fair and we can stay here<end_line>
I'm trying to transform you Boyz II Men like daycare'<end_line>
Hey there's money to be made and, n*ggaz got the picture<end_line>
Stopped playing with my paper and, we got richer<end_line>
Then hard times fell upon us, half of my staff<end_line>
had warrants, the other half, in the casket lay dormant<end_line>
I felt like life was cheating me, for the first time<end_line>
in my life I was getting money but it was like my concious was eating me<end_line>
Was this a lesson God teaching me?  Was he saying that?<end_line>
I'm playing the game straight from Hell from which few came back<end_line>
like bad coke, pimp or die, was my mindframe bad<end_line>
Was n*ggaz thinkin simplify was turning cocaine crack?<end_line>
Ain't a whole lot of brain to that, just trying to maintain a stack<end_line>
and not collide like two trains that's on the same track         <end_line>
But, get my life together like the oars I bring back<end_line>
In the bottom of the pot where no, water gets hot<end_line>
Got my transporter take it 'cross the border then stop<end_line>
To set up shop with a quarter of rock - here's the plan!<end_line>
For three straight weeks, n*ggaz slaughtered the block<end_line>
But you know the game is 'lluted, f*cked up me and my dues<end_line>
One drop can wipe a n*gga out, faster than the cops<end_line>
and this unstable way of living just, had to stop<end_line>
Half of my n*ggaz got time, we done real things<end_line>
By ninety-four became the subject of half of y'all n*ggaz rhymes<end_line>
Public apoligies to the families of those caught up in my street<end_line>
But that's the life for us lost souls brought up in the streets<end_line>
The life and times of a demonic mind, excited with crime<end_line>
And the lavish luxuries that just excited my mind<end_line>
I figured, 'Sh*t why risk myself I just write it in rhymes<end_line>
And let you feel me, and if you don't like it then fine'<end_line>
The mindstate, of a n*gga who boosted the crime rate<end_line>
so high in one city they send National Guards to get me<end_line>
Ya dig?<end_line>
