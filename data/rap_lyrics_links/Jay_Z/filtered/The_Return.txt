Mirror mirror on the wall<end_line>
Whose is the freshest of them all?<end_line>
I love 'em all, but none of y'all<end_line>
Is Doug E., as me and the boy Kelly<end_line>
With the suicide doors, fuck 'em all<end_line>
We got hits like a thirty shot clip<end_line>
When we throw it in the air, everybody hit the floor<end_line>
Holla at your boy, boys<end_line>
When we boys, so we bringin' out them toys<end_line>
I ain't a lame, on them Dana Dane's<end_line>
Wiggie, you annoyed man, when the year change, we change<end_line>
Nigga, we right here, we can go bank for bank<end_line>
We can go clip for clip, nigga, chain for chain<end_line>
We can go bitch for bitch, got a pretty young thing<end_line>
That I keep by my hip, like my celly that rings<end_line>

Best of both worlds, and we rock the club<end_line>
Boy H-O, Kells, we not playing<end_line>
Losers lose, so when we does what we do, we win<end_line>
And win again, like deja vu<end_line>
Then we win again, like M.J. do<end_line>
Three-peat, then we retreat to waters that's blue<end_line>
Young Scrappy, that's what grown man do, let's move<end_line>
