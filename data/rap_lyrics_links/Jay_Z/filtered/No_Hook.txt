<verse_start>
Poor me, dad was gone, finally got my dad back<end_line>
Liver bad, he wouldn't live long, they snatched my dad back<end_line>
God as I never had that, streets was my second home<end_line>
Welcomed me with open arms provided a place to crash at<end_line>
A place to study math at, matter of fact, I learned it all<end_line>
Burned it all, this music is where I bury the ashes at<end_line>
Flash back, not having much, not having that<end_line>
Had to get some holla bread so you can holla back, and holla that<end_line>
My Jewish lawyer too enjoyed the fruit of letting my cash stack<end_line>
And just in case a nigga gotta use his rat-tat-tat-tat<end_line>
Own boss, own your, masters, slaves<end_line>
The mentality I carry with me to this very day<end_line>
Fuck rich, let's get wealthy, who else gon feed we?<end_line>
If I need it, I'ma get it however, God help me<end_line>
....And I don't need no hook for this shiiiit<end_line>
I'm so fa sho, it's no facade<end_line>
Stay outta trouble, momma said, as momma sighed<end_line>
Her fear her youngest son be a victim of homicide<end_line>
But I gotta get you outta here momma, or I'ma die<end_line>
And either way, you lose me momma so let loose of me<end_line>
I got the rain our direction will soon change<end_line>
To live and die in N-Y in the hustle game<end_line>
Hustle caine, hustle clothes, I hustle music<end_line>
But hustle hard in any hustle that you pick<end_line>
Skinny nigga, toothpick, but, but I do lift <end_line>
Weight like I'm using, rhoids, Rolls, Royce keep my movements<end_line>
Smooth while manuevering, through all the maneur in<end_line>
The sewer that I grew up in<end_line>
Choices, we make trying to escape<end_line>
And I don't need no hook for this shiiiit...<end_line>
This is not for commercial usage<end_line>
Please don't categorize this as music<end_line>
Please don't compare me to other rappers<end_line>
Compare me to trappers, I'm more Frank Lucas than Ludacris<end_line>
And Luda's my dude, I ain't trying to diss<end_line>
Like Frank Lucas is cool, but I ain't trying to snitch<end_line>
I'ma follow the rules no matter how much time I'ma get<end_line>
I'ma live and die with the decisions that I'ma pick<end_line>
So fuck Dehaven for caving, that's why we don't speak<end_line>
Made men ain't supposed to make statements<end_line>
End of the story, I followed the code, cracked the safe<end_line>
Other niggas ain't in the game so they practice hate<end_line>
Leave that boy Hov alone, why don't cha?<end_line>
You don't have to if you don't want to but don't say I didn't warn ya<end_line>
And I don't need no hook for this shiiiit...<end_line>
