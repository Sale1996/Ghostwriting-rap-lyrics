Sweet - and still there's pain<end_line>
If I would have grew up to be a doctor<end_line>
My nephews would have grew up to do the same<end_line>
But since I grew up through the game<end_line>
And my influence is the same<end_line>
And my therapy is music<end_line>
They ask if you ashamed<end_line>
And though I wish I could separate the two things<end_line>
I cannot so my answer to you remains<end_line>
I can walk down the hall of mirrors in Versailles<end_line>
And be so satisfied when I look myself in the eyes<end_line>
No shame, no sir<end_line>
Just big boats and tearin the coast up<end_line>
Tight coups like I'm wearin the roadster<end_line>
For in the coup, bearhuggin the holster<end_line>

<verse_start>
So I make no apologies, crooked policies <end_line>
So a G a nigga gotta be<end_line>
We playin for property no monopoly<end_line>
So I'll pass go and let my nephew follow me<end_line>
They say the child shall lead<end_line>
So I take it far as I can and then we shall see<end_line>
Shall we dance with the devil for a beat<end_line>
I pray to God I ain't got two left feet<end_line>
Do the hustle put keys in the street<end_line>
Then I'm ballroom dancing <end_line>
Ke-ke'in in the suite<end_line>
Sweet, BB's on the feet<end_line>
TV's in the seat, ene-mies on the creep<end_line>
It's so corrupt<end_line>
Soak it up it's a lesson <end_line>
Every fuck up<end_line>
One day you're up <end_line>
Next day you're down <end_line>
Long as you stay the same it'll come back around<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I'm even better<end_line>
I'm eatin better<end_line>
Best thing about it is<end_line>
My niggas eatin together<end_line>
With each endeavor,  we reachin levels<end_line>
Niggas ain't seen in like forever <end_line>
I'm Hyman Roth I made all my partners rich<end_line>
I can't  vouch for you<end_line>
If you ain't a part of this<end_line>
So pardon me as I pave my wrist<end_line>
As I parlay my chips<end_line>
HOV alright alright<end_line>
American gangster gangster<end_line>
Businesses  like I'm white<end_line>
But I'm not, I'm just bright<end_line>
So fly with no fear of the flight<end_line>
So if y'all hear my plight<end_line>
And if you think you can make it this far without a fight<end_line>
Couple mistakes here and there<end_line>
Not always right, but I'm always real<end_line>
That's how I sleep at night<end_line>
<verse_end>
