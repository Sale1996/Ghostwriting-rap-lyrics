<verse_start>
Sorry junior, I already ruined ya<end_line>
Cause you ain't even alive, paparazzi pursuin ya<end_line>
Sins of a father make yo' life, ten times harder<end_line>
I just wanna take you to a barber<end_line>
Bondin on charters, all the shit that I never did<end_line>
Teach ya good values, so you cherish it<end_line>
Took me twenty-six years to find my path<end_line>
My only job is cuttin the time in half<end_line>
So at thirteen we'll have our first drink together<end_line>
Black bar mitzvahs, mazel tov, mogul talk<end_line>
Look a man dead in his eyes<end_line>
So he know you talk truth when you speak it, give your word, keep it<end_line>
And if the day comes I only see him on the weekend<end_line>
I just pray we was in love on the night that we conceived him<end_line>
Promise to never leave him even if his mama tweakin<end_line>
Cause my dad left me and I promise never repeat him<end_line>
Never repeat him, never repeat him<end_line>
<verse_end>
