	in New York City for the first day in the trial of <end_line>
	I'm gone<end_line>
	the State vs. Shawn Carter, a.k.a. Jay-Z<end_line>

Aiyyo, stand forward, 'fore you take notice<end_line>
or witness to me killin the track<end_line>
Testify 'til me spillin the smack<end_line>
Now they got me for traffickin, racketeerin, audio crack<end_line>
	They call me Dope Man, Dope Man<end_line>
	I try to tell em I'm where hope, floats man<end_line>
	Ghetto spokes-man<end_line>
A broke man, approachin the bench with intent<end_line>
to bury me under the cell, fingered me as the toast man<end_line>
Evidence stemmin from ninety-six<end_line>
They say the world ain't recovered from his fix<end_line>
While they was usin cut I was on some other shit<end_line>
Gave it to you raw and they just discovered it<end_line>
Nowaday, the jury got they brow raised<end_line>
Listenin to testimony about my foul ways<end_line>
Exhibit A: "Reasonable Doubt"<end_line>
They say this was the first thing that turned the peoples out<end_line>

How come, you label your brand of dope<end_line>
"Volume 1" and spread it through the slums?<end_line>
Fed it to the young with total disregard<end_line>
Your honor, the State seeks the maximum charge<end_line>
And how could you, turn right around<end_line>
and release a lethal dosage called "Volume 2"<end_line>
And is true you operate the criminal enterprise<end_line>
known as Roc-a-Fella in charge of his meteoric rise?<end_line>
And do you deny you're responsible for the demise<end_line>
of record execs, and do you object?<end_line>
Your distribution's Polygram, and through your connects<end_line>
Def Jam, you pushed over five million SoundScan<end_line>
And not to mention, your co-horts and henchmen<end_line>
Dame, Biggs, Lyor, Kev' and Russell Simmons<end_line>
And we ain't gon' talk about Murder, Inc.<end_line>
That just establishes a darker deeper criminal link<end_line>

<verse_start>
Right hand on the Bible, left hand in the air<end_line>
Before I spoke one word, made sure my throat was clear<end_line>
A-hem, I'm a prisoner of circumstance<end_line>
Frail nigga, I couldn't much work with my hands<end_line>
But my mind was strong, I grew where you hold your blacks up<end_line>
Trap us, expect us not to pick gats up<end_line>
Where you drop your cracks off by the Mack trucks<end_line>
Destroy our dreams of lawyers and actors<end_line>
Keep us spiralin, goin backwards<end_line>
At age nine, saw my first hate crime<end_line>
Blindfolded, expected to walk a straight line<end_line>
Mind molded, taught to love you and hate mine<end_line>
Climbed over it, at a early age, Jay shined<end_line>
Fuck the system at Lady Justice I blaze nine<end_line>
Your Honor, I no longer kill my people, I raise mine<end_line>
The soul of Mumia in this modern day time<end_line>
