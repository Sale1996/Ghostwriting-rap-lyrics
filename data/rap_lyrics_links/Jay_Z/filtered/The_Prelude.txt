<verse_start>
The game's fucked up<end_line>
Nigga's beats is bangin, nigga your hooks did it<end_line>
Your lyrics didn't, your gangster look did it<end_line>
So I would write it if y'all could get it<end_line>
Bein intricate'll get you wood, critic<end_line>
On the internet, they like you should spit it<end_line>
I'm like you should buy it, nigga that's good business<end_line>
Hehe, forget this rap shit I need a new hustle<end_line>
A little bit of everything, the new improved Russell<end_line>
I say that reluctantly cause I do struggle<end_line>
As you see I can't leave so I do love you<end_line>
But I'm just a hustler disguised as a rapper<end_line>
In fact you can't fit this hustle inside of a wrapper<end_line>
Back when crack was<end_line>
What these pills are, I was a real star<end_line>
Complete with real, cars, no video ones<end_line>
You can come and set up a camera, let the video run<end_line>
And my real life, complete with real, ice<end_line>
VVS boulders oh they're visibly set<end_line>
Head and shoulders, my invisible neck<end_line>
You see Hova, wasn't digital yet<end_line>
Befo' Steve Jobs, made the iPod<end_line>
Was gettin head, jobs, we call that intimate<end_line>
Back when rappers wouldn't dare play lyrical roulette<end_line>
With a automatic weapon I was reppin with a tec<end_line>
+Fresh+ like +Mannie+ be, chain like anti-freeze<end_line>
Shoebox full of cash, dealer man hand me ki's<end_line>
Pantries full of Arm & Hammer, don't take Nancy Drew to see<end_line>
what it do, I'm a damn G<end_line>
Just sent a million dollars through a hands free<end_line>
That's big money talk, can you answer me?<end_line>
Before the answer was a 3<end_line>
I was down in Georgetown with a Hoya chick, lawyer chick<end_line>
Sure he's rich now cause he saw the shit, all this shit<end_line>
That's why they call him Hov', cause he came before all this shit<end_line>
Bought a 6, quarter seven, skipped on them quarter eights<end_line>
Bought a 9 for non-stop glock work all the time<end_line>
Woo! Guess who's back?<end_line>
Since this is a new era, got a fresh new hat<end_line>
Ten year veteran, I've been set<end_line>
I've been through with this bullshit game but I never quit<end_line>
I used to think rappin at 38 was ill<end_line>
But last year alone I grossed 38 mill'<end_line>
I know I ain't quite 38 but still<end_line>
The flow so +Special+ got a +38+ feel<end_line>
The real is back, hehehehe<end_line>
