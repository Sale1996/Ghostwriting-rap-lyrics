Man, they go and tell me like<end_line>
you never know who your true friends until you ah umm<end_line>
both got a little bit of money<end_line>
I mean cause y'all both broke<end_line>
then there's no strain on the relationship, y'all both broke<end_line>
And if you got money and he ain't got no paper<end_line>
He still needs you so you'll never know how he really feel about you<end_line>
When y'all both get some paper, you'll see<end_line>
<verse_end>

We used to get money together, phone honies together<end_line>
Pushin chromed out twinkies in custom coach leather<end_line>
You claim it's all love, but nigga it's whatever<end_line>
Cause this is business, it ain't personal<end_line>
Same dream, same team, same schemes<end_line>
We even sold to the same damn fiends<end_line>
Ain't no rules in this war for this green<end_line>
This is business, and it ain't personal<end_line>

I know when I first started it was crazy to y'all<end_line>
"He's gon' start his own label, he'll never be able"<end_line>
Well, nigga you've been wrong before<end_line>
And you'll be wrong again if you bet against him<end_line>
We move through the hood like identical twins<end_line>
But it just so happen that a nigga made it rappin<end_line>
You showed your true colors, y'all niggaz stay yappin<end_line>
That don't stop him, a nigga weigh platinum<end_line>
Stop through the hood, to say what's happenin?<end_line>
Fake hugzfake whassup<end_line>
Fake love, fake fuck, fake thugs<end_line>
Gotta one myself for your fake shit, I raise up<end_line>
Hop in my wheels and I peel, streets are blazed up<end_line>
About my bid'ness dog, y'all need to stay up - one<end_line>

We don't vibe no more because we don't C/see alike<end_line>
And your mom got it twisted, she think Hov' changed<end_line>
Nope; Hov's still here like Rogaine<end_line>
Ask your boy what he did to the Hov' game<end_line>
How he jeapordized the whole game<end_line>
Now when we see each other it's so strange<end_line>
I don't know whether to hug him or slug him<end_line>
I don't know whether to cap him or dap him<end_line>
I don't know what to think of him, I don't know what's happenin<end_line>
But what I do know, all the niggaz that you know<end_line>
locked up doin a few doe, but who knows?<end_line>
Maybe it wasn't you, maybe I'm buggin too<end_line>
But I'm scared dog, I don't know what the fuck to do<end_line>
Do me a favor, place yourself in my shoes<end_line>
The game, no exceptions, gotta follow the rules<end_line>
<verse_end>
