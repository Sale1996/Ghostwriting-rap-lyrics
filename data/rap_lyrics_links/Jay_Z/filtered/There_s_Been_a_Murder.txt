<verse_start>
I hustle from, night to morning, dawn to dusk<end_line>
Kidnap and robberies like,"You goin with us" <end_line>
I held roundtable meetings so we could go on and discuss<end_line>
not only money but all the emotions goin through us<end_line>
Why we don't cry when niggaz die, that's how the street raised him<end_line>
Look in the air, say a prayerhopin God forgave him<end_line>
Cop liquor, twist it, tap it twice, pour it to the pavement<end_line>
We live dangerous, often findin ourself in the eyes of strangers<end_line>
 My dream is big and in it my team is rich<end_line>
as seen through the eyes of a nigga who ain't seen shit<end_line>
Back to live action, I'm packin, I'm still in the mix<end_line>
like new hits, I think I'm goin over your head a lil' bit<end_line>
But I let you know I changed names when I roam through town<end_line>
Stay free and be who I'm professional known as now<end_line>
Jay-motherfuckin-Z; and with that said<end_line>
back to Shawn Carter the hustler, Jay-Z is dead, and uhh<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
My infatuation with autos led to autos gettin sprayed<end_line>
Houses gettin broken in, quarters gettin trayed<end_line>
Bricks gettin chopped, mom's pots gettin used<end_line>
One thrown in that water, try the soda if there's two<end_line>
Expensive shoes worn, Louis Vuitton seats, roof gone<end_line>
Coke cheap, my face is like a coupon<end_line>
I gotta do Shawn, cause even when Jay-Z was lukewarm<end_line>
I was gettin my loot on, nigga I'm too strong<end_line>
Eat til the food's gone, they placed me on this earth<end_line>
The twin brother of Rich Porter, seperated at birth<end_line>
I got the soul of a hustler, quiet noise like a muffler<end_line>
Fuck with us, walk through the ghetto, see the place that corrupted us<end_line>
Learn why we buck at the guys that come up with us<end_line>
Ain't enough bucks for us to split in this shit<end_line>
Plus ain't nobody lovin us; and with that said<end_line>
back to Shawn Carter the hustler, Jay-Z is dead, and uhh<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
See my life is like a see-saw<end_line>
And until I move this weight it's gon' keep me to the floor<end_line>
Travel with me through my deep thoughts<end_line>
Y'all can't learn Jigga by the shit y'all be readin in The Source;<end_line>
It's deeper of course<end_line>
Follow the life of this reckless minor<end_line>
At sixteen in the 600, unlicensed driver<end_line>
Playin, cops and robbers, like shots can't stop us<end_line>
Flippin a bird to the choppers<end_line>
Buck-thirty on the turns<end_line>
Reckless abandon, when I'm standin on this pedal<end_line>
Hand on my metal, minus all this time they tryin to give me<end_line>
Lord help me, all I ever wanted to be was wealthy or<end_line>
somebody to tell me that they felt me<end_line>
I tried to play the hand you dealt me<end_line>
but you gave me five funnies an' shit<end_line>
I was hungry I need menage money<end_line>
Nothin less than a 520; and with that said<end_line>
back to Shawn Carter the hustler, Jay-Z is *BLAM*<end_line>
