<verse_start>
Yeah, prime time, beat by Dion<end_line>
Our third eon, that's what the fuck we on<end_line>
Mo' money, forty year old phenom<end_line>
Our fifteen minutes of fame has stretched beyond<end_line>
At forty-two be better than twenty-fours<end_line>
I carried the four-five, mastered forty-eight laws<end_line>
Still wearing my twenty-three's they can't fuck with the boy<end_line>
As far as them 16's, I'm +23+ of it all<end_line>
Prime time, ridin that six deuce<end_line>
The nine-eleven, I only subtract the roof<end_line>
Started in eighty-eight, got warm in ninety-two<end_line>
I landed in ninety-six, that's the year I came through<end_line>
I hit the club, ordered some Grey Goose<end_line>
Switched it for Ciroc to give Puff's stock a boost<end_line>
New money, I found the fountain of youth<end_line>
I'm headed to Miami to fuck up the Fontaine Bleu<end_line>
A case of Ace, make it two<end_line>
Nigga we rollin, beat the deuce<end_line>
The night is young, what the fuck we gon' do?<end_line>
