Good dudes - I know you love me like cooked food<end_line>
Even though a nigga got move like a crook move<end_line>
We was together on the block since free lunch<end_line>
We shoulda been together havin 4 Seasons brunch<end_line>
We used to use umbrellas to face the bad weather<end_line>
So now we travel first class to change the forecast<end_line>
Never in bunches, just me and you<end_line>
I loved your point of view cause you held no punches<end_line>
Still I left you for months on end<end_line>
It's been months since I checked back in<end_line>
Well somewhere in a small town, somewhere lockin a mall down<end_line>
Woodgrain, four and change, Armor All'd down<end_line>
I can understand why you want a divorce now<end_line>
Though I can't let you know it, pride won't let me show it<end_line>
Pretend to be heroic, that's just one to grow with<end_line>
But deep inside a nigga so sick<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
On repeat, the CD of Big's "Me and My Bitch"<end_line>
Watchin Bonnie and Clyde, pretendin to be that shit<end_line>
Empty gun in your hand sayin, "Let me see that clip"<end_line>
Shoppin sprees, pull out your Visa quick<end_line>
A nigga had very bad credit, you helped me lease that whip<end_line>
You helped me get the keys to that V dot 6<end_line>
We was so happy poor but when we got rich<end_line>
That's when our signals got crossed, and we got flipped<end_line>
Rather mine, I don't know what made me leave that shit<end_line>
Made me speed that quick, let me see - that's it<end_line>
It was the cheese helped them bitches get amnesia quick<end_line>
I used to cut up they buddies, now they sayin they love me<end_line>
Used to tell they friends I was ugly and wouldn't touch me<end_line>
Then I showed up in that dubbed out buggy<end_line>
And then they got fussy and they don't remember that<end_line>
And I don't remember you..<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
A face of stone, was shocked on the other end of the phone<end_line>
Word back home is that you had a special friend<end_line>
So what was oh so special then?<end_line>
You have given away without gettin at me<end_line>
That's your fault, how many times you forgiven me?<end_line>
How was I to know that you was plain sick of me?<end_line>
I know the way a nigga livin was whack<end_line>
But you don't get a nigga back like that!<end_line>
Shit I'm a man with pride, you don't do shit like that<end_line>
You don't just pick up and leave and leave me sick like that<end_line>
You don't throw away what we had, just like that<end_line>
I was just fuckin them girls, I was gon' get right back<end_line>
They say you can't turn a bad girl good<end_line>
But once a good girl's goin bad, she's gone forever..<end_line>
And more forever<end_line>
Shit I gotta live with the fact I did you wrong forever<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
It's fucked up girl..<end_line>
<verse_end>
