<verse_start>
This is the shit you dream about with the homie steamin out<end_line>
Back-to-back, backin them Beemers out<end_line>
Seems as our, plans to get a grand<end_line>
Then go off to college, didn't pan or even out<end_line>
We need it now, we need a town<end_line>
We need a place to pitch, we need a mound<end_line>
For now, I'm just a lazy boy<end_line>
Big dreaming in my La-Z-Boy<end_line>
In the clouds of smoke, been playin this Marvin<end_line>
Mama forgive me, should be thinkin 'bout Harvard<end_line>
But that's too far away, niggaz are starvin<end_line>
Ain't nuttin wrong with my aim, just gotta change the target<end_line>
I got, dreams of baggin sni-dow, the size of pil-lows<end_line>
I see pies everytime my eyes cli-dose<end_line>
I see rides, sixes, I gotta get those<end_line>
Life's a bitch, I hope to not make her a widow<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Uh, uhhhh~!<end_line>
Now see the life's right there, and it seems right there<end_line>
It's not quite near, and it's not like we're<end_line>
professionals, movin the decimals<end_line>
Know where to cop? Nah! Got a connect? No<end_line>
Who in the F knows how to be successful<end_line>
Need a "Personal Jesus," I'm in Depeche Mode<end_line>
They say its celestial, its all in the stars<end_line>
Like Tony LaRussa on how you play your Cards<end_line>
Cause y'all ain't fuckin with me! The ironies are<end_line>
At all costs bet on before he was boss<end_line>
Now let's start, on your mark<end_line>
Get set, let's go, get out the car<end_line>
Goin in circles it's a vicious cycle<end_line>
This is a crash course, this ain't high school<end_line>
Wake up Muttley, you're dreamin again<end_line>
Your own reality show, the season begins<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Step one in this process, scramble up in your projects<end_line>
And head to the heights where big coke is processed<end_line>
You gotta convince 'em that you're not from the precinct<end_line>
Please speak slow cause he no speaky no english<end_line>
If he takes a likin after a couple of trips<end_line>
and your money is straight, he's gon' give you consignment<end_line>
You're now in a game where only time can tell<end_line>
Survive the droughts, I wish you well - hold up<end_line>
Survive the droughts? I wish you well?<end_line>
How sick am I? I wish you health<end_line>
I wish you wheels, I wish you wealth<end_line>
I wish you insight so you could see for yourself<end_line>
You could see the signs when the jackers is schemin<end_line>
And the cops is comin, you could read they mind<end_line>
You could see from behind, you could redefine<end_line>
the game as we know it, one dream at a time<end_line>
I'm American dreamin<end_line>
<verse_end>
