H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A<end_line>
Fo' shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA<end_line>
Was hurtin 'em in the home of the Terrapins; got it dirt cheap for them<end_line>
Plus if they was short with cheese I would work with them<end_line>
Brought in weed, got rid of that dirt for them<end_line>
Wasn't born hustlers, I was birthin 'em<end_line>
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A<end_line>
Fo' sheezy my neezy keep my arms so freezy<end_line>
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me<end_line>
Haters want me clapped and chromed it ain't easy<end_line>
Cops wanna knock me, D.A. wanna box me in<end_line>
But somehow, I beat them charges like Rocky<end_line>
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A<end_line>
Not guilty, he who does not feel me<end_line>
is not real to me, therefore he doesn't exist<end_line>
So poof -- vamoose, son of a bitch!<end_line>

Holla at me...<end_line>
I do this for my culture<end_line>
To let 'em know what a nigga look like, when a nigga in a roaster<end_line>
Show 'em how to move in a room full of vultures<end_line>
Industry shady it need to be taken over<end_line>
Label owners hate me I'm raisin the status quo up<end_line>
I'm overchargin niggaz for what they did to the Cold Crush<end_line>
Pay us like you owe us for all the years that you hoed us<end_line>
We can talk, but money talks so talk mo' bucks<end_line>
<verse_end>

Hov' is back, life stories told through rap<end_line>
Niggaz actin like I sold you crack<end_line>
Like I told you sell drugs; no, Hov' did that<end_line>
so hopefully you won't have to go through that<end_line>
I was raised in the pro-jects, roaches and rats<end_line>
Smokers out back, sellin they mama's sofa<end_line>
Lookouts on the corner, focused on the ave<end_line>
Ladies in the window, focused on the kinfolk<end_line>
Me under a lamp post, why I got my hand closed?<end_line>
Cracks in my palm, watchin the long arm of the law<end_line>
So you know I seen it all before<end_line>
I seen hoop dreams deflate like a true fiend's weight<end_line>
To try and to fail, the two things I hate<end_line>
Succeed in this rap game, the two things that's great<end_line>
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A<end_line>
What else can I say about dude, I gets bu-sy<end_line>
