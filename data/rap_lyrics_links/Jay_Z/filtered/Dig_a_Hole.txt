They like, that's why they call you Hov I'm like yea<end_line>
I'm like air, little shots go through me, won't tear<end_line>
Want tissue no tears, no tissue not an issue<end_line>
Don't cry for me I peep these niggaz from deep<end_line>
Got a front row seat even if you don't speak<end_line>
Silent partner I hear you loud and clear<end_line>
You left your fingerprint you aint got to be there<end_line>
I'm just waiting till you dig a hole big enough to put your whole body in<end_line>

Its nothing but a hobby to him<end_line>
Simple as serve and volley to him<end_line>
Niggaz like, "Hov, why don't you get at old boy?"<end_line>
Why kill a puppet and leave Gepetto alive?<end_line>
Why not wait to catch 'em all together?<end_line>
This way you dig one big hole, one time<end_line>

How's niggaz dissing me?<end_line>
For niggaz to make history<end_line>
Please explain the shit to me<end_line>
Have we forgotten our history<end_line>
It's like the disciples dissin Jesus becoming his rivals<end_line>
Shunning the one thing that they owed their life to<end_line>
You let that man hype you to go against your idol<end_line>
Knowing good and goddamn well this what I do<end_line>
Think I'm in the office I'm off my grind<end_line>
That's how kids become orphans<end_line>
I keep my enemies close, I give 'em enough rope<end_line>
They put themselves in the air I just kick away the chair<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Hov gon' get you I ain forget your lil' disrespect<end_line>
No ho, Daddy gon' spank you for that shit you said<end_line>
It's hard to do when you got nothing to prove<end_line>
Everybody know you better you in a lose lose<end_line>
Cuz even when you win ultimately you lose<end_line>
Real niggaz like, "Why Hov talking to dude?"<end_line>
You selling little tools, only time you went plat<end_line>
My chain was on your neck, that's a natural fact<end_line>
So I'm praying that it spills outside of the booth<end_line>
That's when ya'll niggaz outside of your truth<end_line>
Outside of your league that's not what you do<end_line>
Niggaz throwing Roc signs outside of your coupe<end_line>
Don't look at Hov like he done something wrong to 'em<end_line>
Cuz he's onto 'em, he just took what belonged to him<end_line>
Niggaz playing checkers with chess playing Hov<end_line>
This game is over I don't know if you know<end_line>
You in a Hole!<end_line>
