It seems, I'm like Keenan, pickin up on the vibe<end_line>
that he ain't too happy, I could just see it in his eyes<end_line>
I don't know if it's the chicks or how we dividin the loot<end_line>
Time to pay his ass a visit 'fore he decide to get cute<end_line>
Jumped out like a star with the flavest car<end_line>
Matchin the gator shirt, softer than my next door neighbors<end_line>
These young niggaz think I fell out the loop<end_line>
cause the last time they seen me hoppin, out the Coupe<end_line>
I hopped out in a suit<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Look at that fake smile he just gave me, it's breakin my heart<end_line>
Should I school him or pull the tools out and just break him apart<end_line>
I felt his hatred it was harsh, 'fore this fakin shit start<end_line>
I should take him in back of the building and blaze him<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Right, yo we wild out in Vegas, styled on haters<end_line>
Mouthed off at the cops, I done crammed every drop<end_line>
Copped whips the same color, we tighter than brothers<end_line>
with different fathers but same mothers, this life don't love us<end_line>
So til death do us, I'm never breakin my bond<end_line>
Nigga we Lex movers, V-12 pushers<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Yeah, you done came upput your life on the line<end_line>
Soaked the game upnow it's yo' time to shine<end_line>
Time to change up, no more second in line<end_line>
Yeah, yeah<end_line>
Coming of Age Two, brand new<end_line>
<verse_end>
