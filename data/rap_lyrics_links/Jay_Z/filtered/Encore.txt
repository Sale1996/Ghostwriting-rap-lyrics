Who you know fresher than Hov'?  Riddle me that<end_line>
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at<end_line>
Can't none of y'all mirror me back<end_line>
Yeah hearin me rap is like hearin G. Rap in his prime<end_line>
I'm, young H.O., rap's Grateful Dead<end_line>
Back to take over the globe, now break bread<end_line>
I'm in, Boeing jets, Global Express<end_line>
Out the country but the blueberry still connect<end_line>
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck<end_line>
But when you Young, what the fuck you expect?  Yep, yep<end_line>
Grand openin, grand closin<end_line>
God your man Hov' cracked the can open again<end_line>
Who you gon' find doper than him with no pen<end_line>
just draw off inspiration<end_line>
Soon you gon' see you can't replace him<end_line>
with cheap imitations for DESE GENERATIONS<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Look what you made me do, look what I made for you<end_line>
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you<end_line>
When you first come in the game, they try to play you<end_line>
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you<end_line>
From Marcy to Madison Square<end_line>
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years<end_line>
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears<end_line>
to be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye<end_line>
When I come back like Jordan, wearin the 4-5<end_line>
It ain't to play games witchu<end_line>
It's to aim at you, probably maim you<end_line>
If I owe you I'm blowin you to smithereeens<end_line>
Cocksucker take one for your team<end_line>
And I need you to remember one thing<end_line>
I came, I saw, I conquered<end_line>
From record sales, to sold out concerts<end_line>
So muh'fucker if you want this encore<end_line>
I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I like the way this one feel<end_line>
It's so muh'fuckin soulful man!<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
So this here is the victory lap<end_line>
Then I'm lea-vin, that's how you get me back<end_line>
After a year of them 16's, it's one point two<end_line>
And that's two point four, and I'm only doin two<end_line>
You wanted to gain attention new dudes<end_line>
I can get you BET and TRL too<end_line>
You wanna be in the public, send your budget<end_line>
Well fuck it, I ain't budgin!<end_line>
Young did it to death, you gotta love it<end_line>
Record companies told me I couldn't cut it<end_line>
Now look at me, all star-studded<end_line>
Golfer above par like I putted<end_line>
All cause the shit I uttered, was utterly ridiculous<end_line>
How sick is this?<end_line>
You want to bang, send Kanye change, send Just some dust<end_line>
Send Hip a grip, then you got' spit<end_line>
A little somethin like this, WOO!<end_line>
