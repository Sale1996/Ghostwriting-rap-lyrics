Everything ain't hardcore you know<end_line>
I can't sing but my man<end_line>
I'ma let my man smooth that thang out for you<end_line>
You know, take the edge off, you know what I'm sayin'?<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
A melody is the chemistry, the way we click<end_line>
It's like four part harmony and all that shit<end_line>
Your waistline is the bassline, I ride that shit<end_line>
Strung off your treble and I'm high as shit<end_line>
We made love in the studio when we got together over and over again like a loop<end_line>
Damn I'm missin' you, it's hard to listen to<end_line>
all these different dudes, huggin' and kissin' you, fuck!<end_line>
