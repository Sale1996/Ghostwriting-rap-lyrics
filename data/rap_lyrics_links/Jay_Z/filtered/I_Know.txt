<verse_start>
She wants that old thing back<end_line>
Uh, uh, uh<end_line>
She want those heroin tracks<end_line>
She likes me<end_line>
She fiends for me nightly<end_line>
She leans for me<end_line>
Morning she rush for my touch<end_line>
This is about lust<end_line>
Cold sweats occur when I'm not with her<end_line>
My presence is a must, must-must<end_line>
Bonita Applebum, I gotta put you on<end_line>
If I didn't when we cuttin', the feeling would be too strong<end_line>
In any form, I'm giving you sweet dreams<end_line>
That Sugar Hill, she call me her sweet thing<end_line>
That Black Rain that take away your pain<end_line>
Just for one night, baby, take me in vein<end_line>
Now that feelin' got you trippin'<end_line>
You no wanna feel no different<end_line>
Said lust has got you itchin'<end_line>
All wide open and its' drippin'<end_line>
I know what you like, I am your prescription<end_line>
I'm your physician, I'm your addiction<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I am so dope<end_line>
Like Louis Vuittons with the red bottoms<end_line>
You gotta have 'em, you glad you got 'em<end_line>
Like every color, Giuseppe's your guilty pleasure is me<end_line>
Its so much fun, you shun therapy<end_line>
Although it never be, the feeling is fleeting<end_line>
Shopping's like coppin', you constantly need it<end_line>
I'm never around, you constantly seeking<end_line>
You'll never be down, I know where your peak is<end_line>
9 1/2 weeks is better than 12-steps<end_line>
I keep tryin' to remind you to keep tellin' yourself<end_line>
Now your conscience is interfering, like "Better yourself!"<end_line>
Like you better get help<end_line>
But when that medicine's felt?<end_line>
We're back together<end_line>
Don't ever leave me<end_line>
Don't ever let 'em tell you that you'll never need me<end_line>
My China White, 'til we D.O.A.<end_line>
Its Montega forever, baby, lets get away....<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
How could you leave me?<end_line>
I thought that you needed me<end_line>
When the world got too much and you pleaded with me<end_line>
Who helped you immediately?<end_line>
How speedy of me<end_line>
How could you deny me so vehemently?<end_line>
Now your body is shakin' trying to free it of me<end_line>
And your soul is in control, trying to lead it from me<end_line>
And your heart no longer pledge allegiance to me<end_line>
Damn, I'm missing the days when you needed the D<end_line>
<verse_end>
