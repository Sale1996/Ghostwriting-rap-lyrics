You've been merciful and your love endureth<end_line>
through all thingsFor that<end_line>
I am eternally grateful.<end_line>

Verse 1<end_line>
Since my date of birth<end_line>
bought you nothing but hurt<end_line>
play those video games<end_line>
stole change from ya purse<end_line>
Sat on the cold court bench<end_line>
'til I was arraigned in ya skirt<end_line>
Saw the pain in ya face<end_line>
through you maintained a smirk<end_line>
All you did was motivate me<end_line>
don't let 'em hold you back<end_line>
What I do I turned around<end_line>
and I sold you crack<end_line>
I was a bastard for that<end_line>
still I'm drowning in shame<end_line>
Just remember one thing now<end_line>
you're not to blame<end_line>
You was newly seperated<end_line>
tryin' to escape ya world<end_line>
and through my thirst<end_line>
I didn't help you<end_line>
I just made things worse<end_line>
I hated me and everybody<end_line>
that created crack<end_line>
Had me thinkin'<end_line>
the newest kicks and the latest gat<end_line>
Still haven't apologized<end_line>
so please play this back<end_line>
while I try to come to terms<end_line>
with such a heinous act<end_line>
you know in more than one way<end_line>
cocaine numbs the brain<end_line>
All I did was think about<end_line>
how the funds once came<end_line>
then I ran across this memory <end_line>
and it stung the brain<end_line>
How can you ever destroy the beauty<end_line>
from which one came<end_line>
That's a savage you're the reason<end_line>
why me and these beats make a marriage<end_line>
why I rhyme above average and<end_line>
I ain't shit<end_line>
Glad you got yourself together<end_line>
no thanks to me<end_line>
Strong and beautiful the way thangs should be<end_line>
You must love me<end_line>

Verse 2<end_line>
We used to fight every night<end_line>
but I never would suffer<end_line>
just smile my big brother's<end_line>
tryna make me tougher<end_line>
As we grew fussing and fighting continued<end_line>
as I plundered through ya stuff<end_line>
and snuck ya clothes to school<end_line>
Got intense real intense<end_line>
as we got older<end_line>
Never believed it would lead<end_line>
to be popped in one of ya shoulda<end_line>
With my rings knew you had it<end_line>
'cause you took too long<end_line>
as Mickey, Andy, and the girl that bought it looked on<end_line>
Huffin' and puffin' gun in my hand<end_line>
told you step outside<end_line>
Hoping you said no but you hurt my pride<end_line>
made our way down the steps<end_line>
maybe you thought it was just a threat<end_line>
or maybe ya life was just that crazy<end_line>
and you was beggin' for death<end_line>
try to justify this in my young mind<end_line>
but ya drillin' it<end_line>
and my ego hurt combined<end_line>
drove me berzerk<end_line>
Saw the devil in your eyes<end_line>
high off more than weed<end_line>
confused I just closed<end_line>
my young eyes and squeezed <end_line>
What a sound <end_line>
opened my eyes just in time<end_line>
to see ya stumbling to the ground<end_line>
Damn what the fuck I done now<end_line>
runnin' around in a circle<end_line>
thinking I'm assed out<end_line>
hot gun burnin' my waist<end_line>
ran straight to Jazz' house<end_line>
Like a stranger damn I just shot my nigga<end_line>
and ran off into the night as if it was not my nigga<end_line>
Left the scene how could I go out that way<end_line>
Still you asked to see me in the hospital ya next day<end_line>
You must love me.<end_line>
