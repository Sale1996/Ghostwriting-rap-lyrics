Thirty-eight waist, enough to put one nine in<end_line>
Really a thirty-six without the gun I'm thin<end_line>

Ignorant bastard, I'm takin it back to day one<end_line>
No kids, but trust me I know how to raise a gun<end_line>
For niggaz that think I spend my days in the sun<end_line>

Homey I'm not into hype; trust me, I'm still street<end_line>
You still fuckin up then trust me I still creep<end_line>
Yeah I know the platinum chain be lookin real sweet<end_line>
but reach and I bury niggaz sixty feet deep<end_line>
S dot Carter turn rappers into martyrs<end_line>
Seperate fathers from they daughters, why bother<end_line>
I'm a crook like you, I took like you<end_line>

Heard about the watch, the Bentley hard-top<end_line>
The Continental T, got em resentin me<end_line>
God I work hard, please don't envy me<end_line>
I paid the cost to be the boss to floss this hard<end_line>
I can recall a year ago I almost lost this job<end_line>
All y'all remember is the part about me parkin the hog<end_line>
What about all them days I was walkin my dogs?<end_line>
Barkin at broads, but they never hollered back<end_line>
And if they did all they said was, "Where dem dollaz at?"<end_line>
Imagine, bein skinny growin up around broader cats<end_line>
The quiet assassin demeanor of them college cats<end_line>
until I got a gat and loudly start poppin back<end_line>
Round the way, niggaz called me Bobby Bouchete<end_line>
Now all I hear is whispers of what you gon' do to Jay<end_line>
How y'all gon' stick me up, take my jewels away<end_line>
Pull out your gat, car jack me take my cruise away<end_line>
Well I got news for y'all fools today, hey..<end_line>

I made it so, you could say Marcy and it was all good<end_line>
I ain't crossover I brought the suburbs to the hood<end_line>
Made em relate to your struggle, told em bout your hustle<end_line>
Went on MTV with do-rags, I made them love you<end_line>
You know normally them people wouldn't be fuckin witchu<end_line>
Til I made em understand why you do what you do<end_line>
I expected to hear, "Jay, if it wasn't for you.."<end_line>
But instead, all I hear is buzzin in your crew<end_line>
How y'all scheamin, tryin to get accustomed to my moves<end_line>
So y'all could tape my mouth, stake out my house<end_line>
But I got pride I'm a nigga first<end_line>
I gotta cock back and pull the trigger first<end_line>
That's how Jigga work<end_line>
The funny thing; I represent y'all everytime I spit a verse<end_line>
and that's the shit that hurts<end_line>
But hey, I got my mind right, got my nine right here<end_line>
So when y'all feel that the time is right..<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Aiy yo yo, aiy yo yo<end_line>
It's only fair that I warn ya, rap's my new hustle<end_line>
I'm treatin it like the corner, fuck with me if you wanna<end_line>
My game change but my mindframe remains the same<end_line>
I gotta protect what's mine<end_line>
Shit I started from nothin; zero, zip<end_line>
I made my way hustlin, I don't owe niggaz shit<end_line>
I'm paranoid now, so I keep the gun gripped<end_line>
Cats I played skelly with?  Niggaz done flipped<end_line>
I keep a banger in the ankle, one in the hip<end_line>
Two in the stash, one come up when I shift<end_line>
I keep one under the chair where I sit<end_line>
I even got a gun in the hair in the bun of my bitch<end_line>
Ask Big; everytime he'd come to my crib<end_line>
he'd find another gun that I hid<end_line>
I'm ready to make this one of the, hottest summer there is<end_line>
Everyday like a hundred-and-six.. shit..<end_line>
