B. my niggaz was strugglin, to the 'burbs they came<end_line>
And then we got to hustlin, murderin thangs<end_line>
I dipped in my stash, splurged on a chain<end_line>
Now I'm Titanic, Iceberg's the name<end_line>
Leave players on injured reserve, hurt the game<end_line>
The best way to describe me in a word, insane<end_line>
I dick down chicks all emerged in my fame<end_line>
Jigga been dope since Slick Rick's first chain<end_line>
The God, send you back to the earth from which you came<end_line>
I'm baking soda, waterfire, merged with 'cane<end_line>
Ladies don't know me said, "I heard he's vain"<end_line>

Roc-A-Fella, Ruff Ryders, niggaz scared of that<end_line>
Got a new motto this year, "Don't Fuck With My Ones"<end_line>
Knock on your door, three in the mornin, <end_line>
"It's just us and the guns!"<end_line>
See I scrambled with priests, hustle with nuns<end_line>

Niggaz get fly, let em defy gravity<end_line>

Streets won't let me chill<end_line>
Always been a clumsy nigga, don't let me spill<end_line>
Muh'fuckers wanna wet me still, I remain y'all<end_line>

All black in the club, the outcome ain't good<end_line>
Them niggaz act like wolves, how come?  They could<end_line>
Cause we don't drop hits, we drop bombs that smash<end_line>
Til the wrists is lit up, the arm looks like glass<end_line>
The necklace chipped up, the charm it flash<end_line>
Could fuck up your eyes like the bombest hash<end_line>
See the reason why chicks let me palm they ass<end_line>
All I gotta do is let em call me Shawn they glad<end_line>
Let me sit up in they whip til I launch it back<end_line>
Snap they neck, then shoot em til they arch them back<end_line>
The calmest cat, trust me when I palm this gat<end_line>
Kill your mind, body and soul, push your conscience back<end_line>
