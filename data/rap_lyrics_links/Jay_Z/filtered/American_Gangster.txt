<verse_start>
I'm from the 80's,<end_line>
Home of the heroine,<end_line>
Error of the hustlers, uh<end_line>
The world is my custy<end_line>
New Rich Porter<end_line>
The way I flip quarters<end_line>
Front on all these other rap artists, but me<end_line>
Momma was a mink wearer, Papa ran numbers<end_line>
So it's plain to see, where my whole plan come from<end_line>
American dream, I'm living the life still<end_line>
The way I shine is like a zillion dollar light bill<end_line>
Still I'm grinding, army jacket lining<end_line>
40 below timbs on, getting my M's on<end_line>
My best friends gone, I seen bad days<end_line>
Still find songs that I hear him on<end_line>
Getting my Mary J. Blige +Reminisce+ on<end_line>
I hear his voice in my mind, like, nigga live on<end_line>
So I get on that fly shit I been on<end_line>
Spin on corners in enzo with rims on<end_line>
But for info, puffin' on Endo-Nesia<end_line>
Give me amnesia<end_line>
I ease up, that right, I'm high nigga<end_line>
I want the sky,<end_line>
The world when I'm done<end_line>
I'm give it to my sons<end_line>
Let 'em live it up, split it up, switch it up, uh<end_line>
Sixes kit it up, man I did it up, done<end_line>
The rest of my belongings belong in the hall of fame, a list of hits next to all my names<end_line>
I came<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
If the sky should fall<end_line>
And it all goes tomorrow, and they foreclose on the house and auction off all my cars<end_line>
Don't cry for me Argentina, I mobbed in the beamer<end_line>
Took trips abroad, got mobbed in Sardina<end_line>
In Ibiza I had pizza in the club<end_line>
Ladies know I'm that guy, they wanna piece of my love<end_line>
Now they wanna ya boy like Mike in his prime<end_line>
Billie Jean, the goddamn boy ain't mine<end_line>
And the Roc break up had the people losing hope<end_line>
Can't lie, they had Muhammad Hovi on the ropes<end_line>
Now I'm back in the go mode, back in the go-go's<end_line>
Throwing the diamond up, repping the logo<end_line>
Rose gold rose flow, I'm okay though<end_line>
What Don't kill me makes stronger than before so<end_line>
Here we go and I'm not domino<end_line>
When it all falls down, I'm like Kanye's jaw<end_line>
I might break but I don't fold, till I hold the sky in my hand<end_line>
Yeah that's my goal<end_line>
And then I bid you Freddy Adu<end_line>
Prodigal Child, y'all not ready for the fu-ture<end_line>
Then I disappear in the Bermuda Triangle<end_line>
My name will be viewed such<end_line>
Here's to the man that refused to give up<end_line>
I want the sky nigga, Chuuuuuuch<end_line>
<verse_end>
