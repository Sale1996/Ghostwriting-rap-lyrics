These niggas want me to go, don't they know that I'm gone?<end_line>

I taught 'em 'bout fishscale, they want me to fish for them<end_line>
They want me to catch clean then cook up a dish for them<end_line>
All of this just for them or they got a diss for him<end_line>
They want me to disappear like it's gon' shift for them<end_line>
They say that I'm in the way, they want me to sit for them<end_line>
But what they admittin' is they ain't got shit for him<end_line>
And really the fact is, we not in the same bracket<end_line>
Not in the same league, don't shoot at the same baskets<end_line>
Don't pay the same taxes, hang with the same bitches<end_line>
So how am I in the way? What is it I'm missin'?<end_line>
Nigga I been missin', nigga I been gone<end_line>
The shit that you just witnessin' - I been on<end_line>
And as for the critics, tell me I don't get it<end_line>
Everybody can tell you how to do it, they never did it<end_line>
Now these niggas is mad, oh, they call me a Camel<end_line>
But I mastered the drought, what the fuck I'm an animal?<end_line>
