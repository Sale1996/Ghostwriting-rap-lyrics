How can you fairly assess something from the outside looking in?<end_line>
There's gotta be them times you'll be wrong. Nah Mean?<end_line>
How can a mother fucka go round and hate a nigga <end_line>
he never even met that he dont even know and shit?<end_line>
I think this rap shit is all beef<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Y'all dont even know every day I'm livin with stress<end_line>
Got up out the streets you think a nigga could rest<end_line>
Can't even enjoy myself at a party unless<end_line>
I'm on the dance floor hot ass vest<end_line>
You think I'm freakin' these chicks right?<end_line>
I'try not to brush against they chest<end_line>
You get a lawsuit for shit like that, I feel trapped<end_line>
Swear to everything when I leave this earth<end_line>
It's gon' be on both feet, never knees in the dirt<end_line>
You could try me fucka but when I squeeze it hurts, fine<end_line>
We'll lose two lives, yours and mines<end_line>
Gimme any amount of time dont let Ms. Carter grieve<end_line>
at the funeral parlor drippin' tears on my sleeve<end_line>
Told the judge didn't budge it was him or me<end_line>
and I ain't trying to be hard but I'm guilty as charged<end_line>
Put my mercy on this court and my faith in God <end_line>
And pray hard none of my nephews wanna be stars...Lucky Me<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I hate all girls with alterior motives<end_line>
That's why I'm twenty plus years old, no sons no daughters<end_line>
Hate putting my life in the hands of fake promoters<end_line>
Hear the hate in my voice right? I hate that you noticed<end_line>
Niggas wanna strip to the bone for shit you own<end_line>
Hate a nigga like that faggot, get your own<end_line>
Hate that I can't roam the street without the clip and chrome<end_line>
Knowing one day Im'a have to flip, c'mon<end_line>
You know the shit don't stop 'til the Crist don't pop<end_line>
And you have to kill a nigga and your wrist don't lock<end_line>
I'm trapped the whole worlds against me in fact,<end_line>
It aint no turning back. Bring It On<end_line>
Hate the price of fame cause it cost too much<end_line>
Can I live without y'all niggas saying I floss too much?<end_line>
Hate the way you make this hate flow all through us<end_line>
Steady looking for flaws through us.... Lucky Me<end_line>

<verse_start>
You only know what you see, <end_line>
You dont understand what it takes to be me<end_line>
You only know what you see, <end_line>
You dont understand what it takes to be me <end_line>
(And now that I've arrived<end_line>
I see those truths unfold before my eyes in this world so cold)<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Nigga see you in the street, pretend to be friendly<end_line>
But I know any type of success breeds envy<end_line>
I know in the back of your mind your conjuring ways to hen me<end_line>
Leave my friends in a circle pouring out Henny<end_line>
But G's is heaven bound so how I'm gon' receive <end_line>
Anything y'all pour to the ground next time throw it up<end_line>
And ain't nothing changed so even in my afterlife I show it up<end_line>
Dont grieve for me my art remains<end_line>
like a dart from the speaker to your heart<end_line>
Spiritually through the portal now my words as a mortal<end_line>
Plan to leave without a fight I plant a seed I give life<end_line>
Though I can't see past the girls greed to call her wife<end_line>
Next time your thinking heist better be precise<end_line>
Cause I'm fully prepared. One of us is gon' leave here<end_line>
I have no regrets even though I wanna see grow<end_line>
My godsons Boogie, Sonny and Rimo<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Chorus x 4<end_line>
