I probably owe it to y'all, proud to be locked by the force<end_line>
Tryin to hustle some things, that go with the Porsche<end_line>
Feelin no remorse, feelin like my hand was forced<end_line>
Middle finger to the law, nigga grippin my balls<end_line>
Said the ladies they love me, from the bleachers they screamin<end_line>
All the ballers is bouncin they like the way I be leanin<end_line>
All the rappers be hatin, off the track that I'm makin<end_line>
But all the hustlers they love it just to see one of us make it<end_line>
Came from the bottom the bottom, to the top of the pots<end_line>
Nigga London, Japan and I'm straight off the block<end_line>
Like a running back, get it man, I'm straight off the block<end_line>
I can run it back nigga cause I'm straight with the Roc<end_line>

Your homey Hov' in position, in the kitchen with soda<end_line>
I just whipped up a watch, tryin to get me a Rover<end_line>
Tryin to stretch out the coca, like a wrestler, yessir<end_line>
Keep the Heckler close, you know them smokers'll test ya<end_line>
But like, fifty-two cards when I'm, I'm through dealin<end_line>
Now fifty-two bars come it, now you feel 'em<end_line>
Now, fifty-two cars roll out, remove ceiling<end_line>
In case fifty-two broads come out, now you chillin<end_line>
with a boss bitch of course S.C. on the sleeve<end_line>
At the 40/40 club, ESPN on the screen<end_line>
I paid a grip for the jeans, plus the slippers is clean<end_line>
No chrome on the wheels, I'm a grown-up for real<end_line>

Your boy back in the building, Brooklyn we back on the map<end_line>
Me and my beautiful beeeeeeeitch in the back of that 'Bach<end_line>
I'm the realest that run it, I just happen to rap<end_line>
I ain't gotta clap at 'em, niggaz scared of that black<end_line>
I drop that +Black, Album+ then I back, out it<end_line>
As the best rapper alive nigga axe about me<end_line>
From Bricks to Billboards, from grams to Grammys<end_line>
The O's to opposite, Orphan Annie<end_line>
You gotta pardon Jay, for sellin out the Garden in a day<end_line>
I'm like a young Marvin in his hey'<end_line>
I'm a hustler homey, you a customer crony<end_line>
Got some, dirt on my shoulder, could you brush it off for me?<end_line>
