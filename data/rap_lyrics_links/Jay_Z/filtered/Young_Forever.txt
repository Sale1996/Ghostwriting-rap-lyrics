So we livin like a video<end_line>
Where the sun is always out and you never get old<end_line>
And the champagne's always cold, and the music's always good<end_line>
And the pretty girls just happen to stop by in the hood<end_line>
And they hop they pretty ass up on the hood of that pretty-ass car<end_line>
Without a wrinkle in today, cause, there's no tomorrow<end_line>
Just a picture perfect day that last a whole lifetime<end_line>
And it never ends cause all we have to do is hit rewind<end_line>
So let's just stay in the moment, smoke some weed, drink some wine<end_line>
Reminisce, talk some shit, forever young is in your mind<end_line>
Leave a mark they can't erase, neither space nor time<end_line>
So when the director yells cut, I'll be fine<end_line>
I'm, forever young<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Fear not when or fear not why, fear not much while we're alive<end_line>
Life is for livin not livin uptight, 'til you somewhere up in the sky<end_line>
Fear not die, I'll be alive for a million years, bye-bye<end_line>
So now for legends I'm forever young, my name shall survive<end_line>
Through the darkest blocks over kitchen stoves over Pyrex pots<end_line>
My name shall be passed down to generations while debatin up in barbershops<end_line>
Young slung, hung here, show that the nigga from here<end_line>
With a little ambition just, what, we can become here<end_line>
And as the father passed the story down to his son's ears<end_line>
Younger get, younger every year, yeah<end_line>
So if you love me baby this is how you let me know<end_line>
Don't ever let me go, that's how you let me know, ba-by<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Just let it run..<end_line>
Slammin Bentley doors, hoppin out of Porsches<end_line>
Poppin up on Forbes list, gorgeous  hold up<end_line>
Niggaz thought I lost it, they be talkin bullshit<end_line>
I'll be talkin more shit, they nauseous  hold up<end_line>
I'll be here forever, you know I'm on my fall shit<end_line>
And I ain't with foreclosure, I will never forfeit<end_line>
Less than four bars, Guru bring the chorus in<end_line>
Did you get the picture yet? I'm paintin you a portrait of Young<end_line>
<verse_end>
