<verse_start>
I brought my sand to the beach, hopped out the Lamb' with the sheep<end_line>
Skin rugs on the floor, we hugged, made love on the seats<end_line>
We tried to hide in the hills, we watched the sky turn peach<end_line>
Summer's light like, summer's night is like, Christ masterpiece<end_line>
She taste like Corona Light, sweet, even the lime gotta squeeze<end_line>
She gave me a lil' swig, to chase behind my weed<end_line>
If I could stay in her hair forever, that'd be fine by me<end_line>
I don't have no concept of time even with a rose gold Concept on me<end_line>
I remember summer nights in the projects, bullet rounds interruptin my ch'i<end_line>
When the worst thing that could happen zipped up his jacket and ran back down the street<end_line>
In Bel-Air only the nights get cold, I wrapped a yellow jacket 'round Bey<end_line>
It's not lost on me, music has my kids sound asleep<end_line>
