Whatever guillotine guides my life<end_line>
Dear Lord, don't let me die tonight<end_line>
But if I shall before I wake what shall I say?<end_line>
It's been a good run from hoodlum to Island estates<end_line>
How could one, make such foul mistakes<end_line>
and still be allowed to have a smile on my face?<end_line>
Hell, whatever the case, I'm glad it wasn't murder<end_line>
in a town you never hearda from a nickel-plated burner<end_line>
Now my life's straight like a perm<end_line>
Try to take the spot I earned muh'fucker better learn<end_line>
It's HOV'!<end_line>

Whatever guillotine guides my life<end_line>
Dear Lord, don't let me die tonight<end_line>
But if I shall before I wake I'd accept my fate<end_line>
I did what I did my heart was in the right place<end_line>
I did so I could live to put food on my plate<end_line>
You musta loved me not to let it end by 3 that day<end_line>
Well, whatever the case, I'm glad it wasn't murder<end_line>
in a town you never hearda from a nickel-plated burner<end_line>
I guess I'm not finished with my journey<end_line>
Please forgive me for my sins, shit I'm still trying to learn<end_line>
Meet HOV'!<end_line>
