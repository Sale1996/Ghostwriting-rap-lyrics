Picture if you will that the throne was burnin, Rome was burnin<end_line>
And I'm sittin in the corner all alone burnin<end_line>
Why does it always end up like this?<end_line>
Something that we don't determine<end_line>
Same people that I fought for<end_line>
That I fight for, that I ride for<end_line>
That I live for, that I die for<end_line>
be the reason that these niggaz is alive for; and they want me dead<end_line>
But I'm so sorry but I just can't die for you<end_line>
But I can make 'em put their hands in the sky for you<end_line>
We waiting for the fireworks like July 4th<end_line>
Get fly more, get high more, cry boy, why for?<end_line>
When the grief is over, beef is over<end_line>
I'll be fly when Easter's over<end_line>
I tried to teach niggaz how to be kings<end_line>
And all they ever wanted to be was soldiers<end_line>
So the love is gone, 'til blood is drawn<end_line>
So we no longer wear the same uniform<end_line>
Fuck you squares, the circle got smaller<end_line>
The castle got bigger, the walls got taller<end_line>
And truth be told after all that said<end_line>
Niggaz still got love for you<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Showed love to you niggaz<end_line>
You ripped out my heart and you stepped on it<end_line>
I picked up the pieces 'fore you swept on it<end_line>
God damn this shit leaves a mess don't it?<end_line>
Shit feelin like death don't it<end_line>
Charge it to the game, whatever's left on it<end_line>
I spent about a minute, maybe less on it<end_line>
Fly pelican fly, turn the jets on it<end_line>
But first I shall digress on it<end_line>
Wasn't I a good king?<end_line>
Didn't I spoil you?<end_line>
Me or the money, what you loyal to?<end_line>
Made you royalty, and royalties<end_line>
And this is how niggaz rewarded me<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Bustin at me, b-b-b-bustin at me<end_line>
But I'm bulletproof, bitch you can't get nothin past me<end_line>
Got body armor<end_line>
And I'm bustin back, so niggaz in the glass house should not throw stones<end_line>
What do you do when the love turns tp hate?<end_line>
Caesar didn't see it so he ceased to exist<end_line>
So the nigga that killed him had keys to his shit<end_line>
Am I my brother's keeper?<end_line>
Got a pistol under my pillow<end_line>
P-p-p-paranoia<end_line>
Blast for yablastin for ya<end_line>
That's an assassin for ya<end_line>
Please lord<end_line>
For these niggazwhat they<end_line>
<verse_end>
