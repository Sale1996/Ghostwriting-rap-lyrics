Yes, yes YEP!<end_line>
Welcome to the.. Jay-Z extravaganza<end_line>
I'd like to introduce my band right now<end_line>
Just Blaze and the Blazettes, hehe<end_line>
Right now I want you to give the drummer some<end_line>
No ma really, give the drummer some<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Follow the flow, look<end_line>
They say a midget standin on the giant's shoulder can see much<end_line>
further than the giant..<end_line>
So I got the WHOLE rap world on my shoulder they tryin to see<end_line>
further than I am..<end_line>
And I have been tryin to be patient with they preoccupation<end_line>
with David and Goliath..<end_line>
But sooner or later, that patience gonna run it's course<end_line>
and I'm forced to be a tyrant..<end_line>
But bein tyrant, comin through your environment<end_line>
Iron mask, nigga iron gas, nigga I am back<end_line>
With "The Team," no I in that<end_line>
R.O.C., y'all not eyein that<end_line>
Y'all don't see, clearly cause the reign ain't gone<end_line>
"The Dynasty," no not Ming but Shawn's<end_line>
Dame careems, nigga it's the gangsta team<end_line>
Stop your run, one of the reasons that they call us gangrene<end_line>
The other reason, we got a gang of green<end_line>
If there's better at gettin cheddar that remains to be seen, nigga<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Jeah, look<end_line>
I'm so far ahead of my time, I'm bout to start another life<end_line>
Look behind you, I'm bout to pass you twice<end_line>
Back to the future and gotta slow up for the present<end_line>
I'm fast, niggaz can't get past my past<end_line>
How they propose to deal with my perfect present?<end_line>
When I unwrap "The Gift & the Curse" in one session<end_line>
Ain't no livin person can test him<end_line>
Only two restin in heaven can be mentioned in the same breath as him<end_line>
Seven straight summers, critics might not admit it<end_line>
But nobody in rap did it, quite like I did it<end_line>
If you did it I done it before, you get I had it<end_line>
Got mad at it and don't want it no more<end_line>
And that goes for everything from flippin that raw<end_line>
Flippin whores, flippin vocal chords, don't get it twisted<end_line>
Get it right, did different, did it better, did it nice<end_line>
Did the impossible then did it twice<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Yup!  Hovi's home, the global phone<end_line>
The world is back in order the number one rap recorder is back<end_line>
You cats overfelt yourself<end_line>
You couldn't help yourself, now witness the reel for reel<end_line>
In my absence cats get, absent-minded<end_line>
Now it's time to rewind and remind 'em<end_line>
why I'm in the position that I am<end_line>
changin the game, my game could nail Madonna<end_line>
Well after I'm gone, they'll honor<end_line>
history in the makin, Pistol Pete<end_line>
leave competition shakin without missin the beat<end_line>
Chasin the hi-hat all over the track<end_line>
The snare is scared of the air in here, BOOM!<end_line>
And plus I get paper dog, don't let me forget<end_line>
The watch face so blue like it's holdin it's breath<end_line>
Can't see me skill for skill or check for check<end_line>
It's the bow tie flow dog, I bring it to your neck<end_line>
Live and correct I will bring it to your set<end_line>
I got now, I don't care who got next<end_line>
Rapper slash exec, Kordell Stewart<end_line>
Your flow all y'all usin is mine, you're all useless<end_line>
You ain't a factor, who are you foolin?<end_line>
You all are faggots, you takin it backwards<end_line>
I'm tryin to progress with this rap shit<end_line>
Nigga, nigga your whole career is a accident<end_line>
Who was gassin 'em? <end_line>
<verse_end>
