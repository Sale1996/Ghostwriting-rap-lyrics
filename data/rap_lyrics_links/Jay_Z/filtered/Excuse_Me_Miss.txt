You already know what it's hittin for<end_line>
Ma I got whatever outside and you know what I'm sittin on<end_line>
50/50 venture with them S dots kickin off<end_line>
Armadale poppin now, only bring a nigga more<end_line>
Only thing missin is a Missus<end_line>
You ain't even gotta do the dishes, got two dishwashers<end_line>
Got one chef, one maid, all I need is a partner<end_line>
to play spades with the cards up, ALL TRUST<end_line>
Who else you gon' run with, the truth is us<end_line>
Only dudes movin units - Em, Pimp Juice and us<end_line>
.. it's the Roc in here!<end_line>
Maybach outside, got rocks in ears<end_line>
PJ's on the runway, Young got air<end_line>
I don't land at a airport, I call it the clearport<end_line>
Therefore, I don't wanna hear more<end_line>
back and forth about who's hot as Young, holla!<end_line>

Everybody's like, "He's no item! Please don't like him.<end_line>
He don't wife 'em, he one nights 'em!"<end_line>
Now she don't like him, she never met him<end_line>
Groupies try to take advantage of him, he won't let 'em<end_line>
He don't need 'em, so he treats 'em like he treats 'em<end_line>
Better them than me, she don't agree with him<end_line>
She's mad at that, he's not havin that<end_line>
So those opposites attract like mag-a-nets<end_line>
She sees more than the Benz wagon, the friends taggin along<end_line>
with a flashy nigga braggin on the song<end_line>
She gets a glimpse of Shawn and she likes that<end_line>
He 2-ways her, so she writes back<end_line>
Smiley faces after all of her phrases<end_line>
Either she the one or I'm caught in "The Matrix"<end_line>
But fukkit, let the +Fish-burne+<end_line>
Red or green pill, you live and you learn, c'mon!<end_line>

Love let's go half on a son, I know my past ain't one<end_line>
you can easily get past, but that chapter is done<end_line>
... but I'm done readin for now<end_line>
Remember spades face up, you can believe him for now<end_line>
But ma you got a f'real f'serious role<end_line>
I'm bout to give you all the keys and security codes<end_line>
Bout to show you where the cheese, let you know I ain't playin<end_line>
But, before I jump out the window, what's your name?<end_line>
<verse_end>
