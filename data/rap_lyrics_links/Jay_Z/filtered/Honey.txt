Lord forgive me I'm ballin out of control<end_line>
Got the spirit of a hustler pourin out of my soul<end_line>
Mami I love you but ain't no stoppin my stroll<end_line>
If you wanna be down with me, you gotta rooolll<end_line>
Like a roll and if my side of the bed gets cold<end_line>
You gotta know that I'm out chasin doooough<end_line>
I'm ain't stuntin these hoes, stuntin my growth<end_line>
If I fuck 'em I'm fleein them, I need somethin to hold<end_line>
Then I'm home to you<end_line>
I might roam like a cellular phone, but I never leave you alone I<end_line>
Solemnly swear, I was married to the block before I met you<end_line>
It's still a part of me there but I<end_line>
Solemnly swear, I try but it's in my blood<end_line>
Pumpin yay, since I was yay high<end_line>
I'm in love with the life<end_line>
So accept me for the bastard that I am<end_line>
You're still in love with me right?<end_line>

Baby girl had me off my grind, off my clock<end_line>
I would often find I was off my block<end_line>
Couldn't keep her off my mind, my balls were shot<end_line>
They never thought that a pause or stop<end_line>
Was in my pores to push rock raw<end_line>
Take a lost rebound like Bo Outlaw, I'm so outlaw<end_line>
Got a hunger for this game, but keep that on the low<end_line>
Like a one against the grain, got the sun against my brain<end_line>
A girl in my ear, I like her for her<end_line>
I'm addicted to this shit, I like it like I like her<end_line>
Sometimes I can't figure it out<end_line>
I'm in love with the life but she's sticking it out<end_line>
She know wanna hug kisses keep a nigga in the house<end_line>
Locked down while his niggas is out<end_line>
