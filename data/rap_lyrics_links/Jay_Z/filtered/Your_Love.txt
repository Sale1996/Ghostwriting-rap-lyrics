Lame mad cause the game that I, spat at his chick<end_line>
So I had to double back quick, and clap at his click<end_line>
Soon as the smoke cleared, I got back in his *bitch*<end_line>
Tell that man son, I ain't your ave-rage<end_line>
My-rap-is-as-sick-as-it-gets<end_line>
All the while, hand my hand on her, ass and hips<end_line>
Told her, "Let's get gone; listen to Christion"<end_line>
Play full of smoke, take small pulls to choke<end_line>
She almost overdosed, how them cats hold their notes<end_line>
Know that the flow's no joke, mine strictly fold dough<end_line>
And since you over age, and, I'm overpaid<end_line>
We can play in the Rover til the verse is over.. Jay<end_line>
