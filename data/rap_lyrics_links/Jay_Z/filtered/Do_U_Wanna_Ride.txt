You know why they call The Projects a project, because it's a project!<end_line>
An experiment, we're in it, only as objects<end_line>
And the object for us to explore our prospects<end_line>
And sidestep cops on the way to the top - yes!<end_line>
As kids we would daydream, sittin on our steps<end_line>
Pointin at cars like yeah that's our six<end_line>
Hustlers, prophets, made our eyes stretch<end_line>
So on some +Dr. Spock+ shit, we +star+ted our +trek+<end_line>
Some of us made it, most of us digressed<end_line>
In the name of those who ain't made it my progress<end_line>
Show success please live through me<end_line>
See I'm the eyes for Emory, keep him alive<end_line>
