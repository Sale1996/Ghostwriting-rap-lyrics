Now the singer Rob calls the police on me<end_line>
Y'all niggaz ran out and copped the CD<end_line>
See what I discovered is y'all snitch lovers<end_line>
I might speak, but I don't fuck with nobody<end_line>
See what Doug, Jimmy & L.A. don't know<end_line>
These young'uns crossed the line with Hov, I'm lettin' it blow<end_line>
Had the papers writing stories like: "Didn't they know?<end_line>
This what happen when they made that rapper CEO"<end_line>
I know, its just a matter of time before the steady hate<end_line>
Starts to overflow, then the levee breaks<end_line>
And my conscience go, "You escaped the RICO<end_line>
Why throw everything away over ego?"<end_line>
You paper chasin', they paper hatin'<end_line>
Billionaire Hov, you on the pace to make it<end_line>
Fuck that, exclamation, comma<end_line>
Quotation's "I love drama", period<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Smelling like Patron, singing dirty rap songs<end_line>
Tip-toeing in the crib like six in the morn'<end_line>
Everyday it's the same<end_line>
I said in +Blueprint+ that I'd +Never Change+, it's just a part of the game<end_line>
Respect me I'm a thug, I might cool out for a sec<end_line>
But expect me to bug, it's in my blood<end_line>
But if my chick leave me she gon' leave me for something<end_line>
She gon' leave me cause Halle, she ain't gon' leave me for nothing<end_line>
Picture me gettin up with something sleazy<end_line>
Something, something, so easy<end_line>
You could take out of speed like nut in something<end_line>
Soon as you finish cuttin', you like, "leave me please"<end_line>
Not me, I need Angelina Jolizeey comfy<end_line>
So I ain't gon' make a move unless I got a Plan B<end_line>
That'll happen the day I have a baby by Free<end_line>
Not to say that anything is wrong with Free<end_line>
Just to say that ain't nothing wrong with me<end_line>
If my hand's in the cookie jar, know one thing<end_line>
I'ma take the cookie, not leave my ring<end_line>
If my hands in the cookie jar know one thing<end_line>
I'ma takey'all know what I mean<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
You little niggaz ain't deep you dumb<end_line>
You niggaz ain't gangsta, you gum, I chew lil' niggaz<end_line>
Hock-too, spew lil' niggaz<end_line>
I can only view lil'niggaz like lil' niggaz<end_line>
But in lieu of lil' niggaz trying to play that boy<end_line>
I *phew, phew* lil' niggaz with the latest toy<end_line>
Unlike you lil' nigga, I'm a grown ass man<end_line>
Big shoes to fill nigga, grown ass pants<end_line>
Probably hustled with your pops, go ask your parents<end_line>
It's apparent you're staring at a legend who<end_line>
Put a few lil' niggaz in their place before<end_line>
Trying to eat without saying their grace before<end_line>
Blasphemous bastard get your faith restored<end_line>
You're viewing your version of the Lord<end_line>
God--MC lil' nigga, applaud, or<end_line>
Forever burn in the fire that I spit at y'all<end_line>
I rebuke you lil' nigga, the meek shall perish<end_line>
I'll roof you lil' nigga, I'm a project terrorist<end_line>
Cute, you lil' niggaz think you in my class<end_line>
Substitute lil' niggaz soon feel my wrath<end_line>
I mute you lil' nigga, you a lil' nigga<end_line>
I shall abuse you lil' nigga, I'm a ill nigga<end_line>
Now shoot you lil' niggaz, go somewhere and play<end_line>
Cause the day I lose to you lil niggaz, no day<end_line>
<verse_end>
