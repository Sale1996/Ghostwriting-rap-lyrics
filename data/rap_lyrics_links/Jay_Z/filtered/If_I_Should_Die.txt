Skated through with the Ceasar Picadas<end_line>
At high school got head by the lockers<end_line>
gassed the baddest girl in the class to show me her knockers<end_line>
rocked jewels dropped school still didn't fail<end_line>
rhymes still written well hold court in the street<end_line>
never sit in the cell for a second then I'm gettin' my bail<end_line>

been on both coasts fired all kinds of heat<end_line>
probably be kinda glad to leave these mean streets<end_line>
I got dead mens to meet and questions to fulfill<end_line>
like is that mystery God real?<end_line>
and how was Kennedy killed? I ain't mad<end_line>
I must've smoked a ton of reefer sipped Coronas<end_line>
with Latifah broke the code of Geneva<end_line>
I know when I reach the other side I'ma see the<end_line>
cat I had beef with who blood remains on my sneaker<end_line>
then it's on again if I could be born again<end_line>
I live my life through my son<end_line>

I'm the aftermath of pleasure never die alone<end_line>
born to live forever through life's struggles<end_line>
I cut corners & took drastic measures<end_line>
see you niggas life expire right in front of me<end_line>
time could never mend what these cold streets<end_line>
mentally done to me too often I close my eyes<end_line>
and see my own coffin feelin' haunted ready to leave<end_line>
this world that I'm lost in my only chance<end_line>
to see the seeds I lost through abortion<end_line>
when I'm gone y'all niggas better not mourn<end_line>
keep flossin' as long as my name<end_line>
lives on what's most important<end_line>
I'll be down in hell scorchin' preparin' for life<end_line>
afterlife still torchin' & blazin' these mics<end_line>
It'd rain for 40 days & 40 nights<end_line>
& I'd return on the 3rd like Christ<end_line>
without my physical portion<end_line>
my spirit a poltergeist for sure<end_line>

...I'd tell Big they're still hearin' his songs<end_line>
run into Pac ask him where we went wrong<end_line>
tell him life is miserable when ya dealin' in the physical form<end_line>
Is everything that's invisible gone?<end_line>
I need to know will I still feel pain or will it be ironic?<end_line>
Will I chill in the flames for all the ills of my brain?<end_line>
Can I reveal the game to all the hustlers<end_line>
trapped in the race and if so can I leave this place?<end_line>
Can I puff cigars & drink Cristal?<end_line>
If this is heaven to me is this considered heavenly?<end_line>
Can I still touch lives answer they "whats & whys"<end_line>
