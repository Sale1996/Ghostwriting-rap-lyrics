Though you got plans to be him<end_line>
Pay homage if by chance you meet him<end_line>
In his pants pocket, your advance and per diem<end_line>
It's the undisputed champion<end_line>
For clique, dough sick, no medicine for us<end_line>
Competition like I said in the chorus<end_line>
Let me spell it out for ya<end_line>
Jay to tha Amil<end_line>
That's how we put it down<end_line>
Chip off the old block<end_line>
Resemble my old pops<end_line>
'Cept I tote glocks and open dope spots<end_line>
And I shut down rap crews<end_line>
Smack them cats who flash tools<end_line>
Laugh at fake ballers with bad jewels<end_line>

No tints, make no mistake y'all it's Hova<end_line>
I stay sportin' played Jordan's before Jordan<end_line>
Verses tight, hooks harder than Ken Norton<end_line>
Musically touching you<end_line>
Truthfully I abuse beats better call BCW<end_line>

Sluggin' you, that's what a thug will do<end_line>

Even when I'm asleep the gats is up<end_line>
Paranoid like Sunny drive backing up<end_line>

Don't try to smooth talk us<end_line>
You got nothing to offer<end_line>
But the baby nine<end_line>
And make ya fine offer<end_line>
The chick is ill<end_line>
Even with four-inch heels<end_line>
No panties on and Patricia Fields<end_line>
I get down<end_line>
Just name the time, the place<end_line>
We could take it back to Vaseline on our face<end_line>
On a regular day we just gleam up your space<end_line>
Rock our own line, got our whole team laced<end_line>
RW with the torch on my jeans by the waist<end_line>
Without heat we still gon steam up the place<end_line>
