Uhh, letter to my dad that I never wrote<end_line>
Speeches I prepared that I never spoke<end_line>
Words on a paper that I never read<end_line>
Proses never penned, they stayed in my head<end_line>
Jotted on dotted lines "I'ma fight you nigga"<end_line>
From stories that I heard, I'm just like you nigga<end_line>
Must've been some pain in your past too<end_line>
Must've been a karma that was past due<end_line>
Must it be the energy that passed through<end_line>
Must've been a pastor, many snafus<end_line>
Started a good man, you married my momma<end_line>
I was in her belly, you hurried that summer<end_line>
She had two kids from a previous mister<end_line>
One family, I don't believe in half-sisters<end_line>
Never treated my brother like a step, pop<end_line>
Remembered the many lessons when we stepped out...<end_line>
What was you preparin' us... for?<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Did you see the runt, as the front-runner<end_line>
or leader of the pack? You see that in your youngins?<end_line>
What ancestors did you summon to the summit<end_line>
to, give me what I needed? What you need to take from 'em?<end_line>
The tsunamis that I swum in to become in<end_line>
Had the cable with the anchor for the places that I sunk in<end_line>
Unc' in a better place but you couldn't function<end_line>
Shot junk in your arms, more than your veins was punctured<end_line>
I punted on feelings, cause you said you was comin'<end_line>
You couldn't kick the habit, I wish you said somethin'<end_line>
You can't avenge these many sins with your own hands<end_line>
You wanna make God laugh, just tell Him your plans<end_line>
Who would've thought I'd be the dad I never had?<end_line>
Be the husband I've become, usually nothin' come from that<end_line>
I forgive you as I live through the beautiful present of the past<end_line>
I'm just thankful that I get all these gifts to unwrap<end_line>
What were you preparin' us... for?<end_line>
<verse_end>
