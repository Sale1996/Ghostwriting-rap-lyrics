Big chips! Big trips to Vegas nigga<end_line>
Big cribs and the whips is spacious<end_line>
Any day they could dig your grave<end_line>
Shit, So Big is my inspiration, dig<end_line>
No reward that's the risk is taken<end_line>
In which case you niggaz wouldn't wanna switch places<end_line>
I on the other hand relish the situation<end_line>
Thank the Lord for the gift, I'm gracious<end_line>
I went overboard, look at this big bracelet<end_line>
I overhauled it you wouldn't recognize it<end_line>
From the time that I bought it I just replaced it<end_line>
I risk cases for shit like this, nigga I pray for some shit like this<end_line>
Word to my Uncle Ray, who gave us life for some shit like this<end_line>
Ma you rollin I'm as real as it gets<end_line>

Big chips! I'm a boss I said<end_line>
Tilt my hat and I cross my legs<end_line>
Like old ladies at the park, I toss my bread<end_line>
And the pigeons start flockin, ballin like Bishop Loughlin<end_line>
And stick Cochran on any DA, to try to stop him<end_line>
So any gunplay that is an option<end_line>
I been doin this since niggaz was woppin<end_line>
Rockin Izods with the matchin socks, and<end_line>
Slap boxin in the back park and when the girls start watchin<end_line>
Try to get real, you had to drop 'em<end_line>
See I ain't never been a fronter<end_line>
Or fake it till I make it tight nigga ma I don't want ya number<end_line>
Either you're comin or I one ya<end_line>
Either you know what you want ma, I don't even want ya<end_line>
You play pretty if you wanna<end_line>
<verse_end>
