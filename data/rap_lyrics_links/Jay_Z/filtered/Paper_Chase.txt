Half a brick of yea, bout to lay down this bitch<end_line>
 Nah, I'm here to like slay down this bitch<end_line>
What you think?  I don't wanna have to spray down this bitch<end_line>
Call my whole team, from around the way down this bitch<end_line>
I'm tryin to stay down this bitch, play down this bitch<end_line>
Had a sound, so my nigga Jay drown the six<end_line>
Roll the windows down and, weight round this bitch<end_line>
But there's a couple things 'fore it's OK round this bitch<end_line>
Gotta talk to the natives, let em know I'm here <end_line>

I got my two guns, I came to scoop ones<end_line>
A down ass bitch and she down to click<end_line>
Got a nice little hooptie that I get around with<end_line>
And my plan is, not to leave this town til I'm rich<end_line>
Gotta find a nigga sellin all them ounces and shit<end_line>
Tell them get down with the click or get found in a ditch<end_line>
See I drop down and strip, I turn around and spit<end_line>
Not to hit em, just to let em know the sound of shit<end_line>
Return later that evening in the club with Fox<end_line>
And I got the snub nosed for those that love to box<end_line>
I'm in search of them young niggaz that hug the block<end_line>
all day, til it's like gray outside<end_line>
Shoot dice talkin shit all day outside<end_line>
And even when it's hot, they outside<end_line>
Let em know, how it's gon' go, Bonnie n Clyde<end_line>
And aiyyo, you will want me on your side<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Yo, yeah, I got that stress and I got it the best<end_line>
I ain't got it to give but I got it to test<end_line>
And if you wanna get down, all you gotta invest<end_line>
is your time, I gotta move this in a, week or less<end_line>
For the next couple of days I brought her all I posess<end_line>
The Rolex, necklaces with the VVS<end_line>
Twin to drive in the passenger with a TV rest<end_line>
For my top draft picks I cop the new GS<end_line>
Now all the little soldiers wanna roll with my team<end_line>
Cause I ain't sold em a dream, I just showed em the cream<end_line>
Picked em up in the afternoons and told em some things<end_line>
You know the regular shit you do when you moldin them teens<end_line>
Yo, never lay your head where you holdin them things<end_line>
From family, to your business, nothing goes in between<end_line>
Never feared no man, put four in his Beem<end_line>
Drop your gun then, blow the scene, ya heard me?<end_line>
