Uhh, got a thing for nickel-plated nines and pretty dimes<end_line>
Mac-11 I squeeze like lemon limes<end_line>
Squirt, obey your thirst, fashion lines<end_line>
'tween beauty and beast, I +Walk the Line+<end_line>
Uh, Johnny Cash, I'm a real G<end_line>
I cut myself today to see if I still bleed<end_line>
... Success is so sublime<end_line>
Gotta do that time to time so I don't lose my mind<end_line>
Somethin 'bout the struggle so divine<end_line>
This sort of love is hard to define<end_line>
When you scratchin for every nickel and dime<end_line>
Got me itchin to do this shit for my mom<end_line>
Uh, do this shit for my town<end_line>
Leave the door open hopin they kick it down<end_line>
Purest form of givin is anonymous, to anonymous<end_line>

<verse_start>
Uhh, sometimes I feel, survivor's guilt<end_line>
I gave some money to this guy, he got high as hell<end_line>
Now I'm part of the problem, far as I could tell<end_line>
Did I do it for him, or do it for myself?<end_line>
Can't lie to myself, I love my niggaz more than my own blood<end_line>
I'd die for my niggaz and I love my cub<end_line>
Hope that's not fucked up<end_line>
I got a problem with the hand-outs; uh, I took the man route<end_line>
I'll give an opportunity though, that's the plan now<end_line>
No guilt in givin, clear a nigga conscience out<end_line>
No guilt in receivin, everything within reason<end_line>
Can't see it takin food out my little monster's mouth<end_line>
That'll drive me +Gaga+, run up in your momma's house<end_line>
Uh, two nickels, one dime<end_line>
Manslaughter charges, the lawyer, knocked it down<end_line>
Uh, I'm just tryin to find common ground<end_line>
'fore Mr. Belafonte come and chop a nigga down<end_line>
Mr. Day-O, major fail<end_line>
Respect these young'ins boy, it's my time now<end_line>
Hublot homie, two-door homie<end_line>
You don't know all the shit I do for the homies<end_line>

<verse_start>
Uh, pardon my hubris, uh, Stanley Kubrick<end_line>
With +Eyes Wide Shut+, I could cook up two bricks<end_line>
Turn nickels to dimes, turn dimes to quarters<end_line>
Turn wives from daughters, oh I'm clear as water<end_line>
And just for clarity, my presence is charity<end_line>
My flow is a gift, philanthropist<end_line>
Uh, e'rybody 'round me rich, or will be<end_line>
Baby boy I promise you this, or kill me<end_line>
And when a nigga go as the old adage go<end_line>
You die rich or you die a disgrace so just let me grow<end_line>
Uhh, watch me cook, throw no looks<end_line>
like Magic in his prime when Kareem sky hooked<end_line>
Yeah, y'all not +Worthy+<end_line>
Sometimes I feel like, y'all don't deserve me, my flow unearthly<end_line>
The greatest form of givin is anonymous, to anonymous<end_line>
So here y'all go, I promise this<end_line>
<verse_end>
