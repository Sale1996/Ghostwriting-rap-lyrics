<verse_start>
They say they never really miss you 'til you dead or you gone<end_line>
So on that note I'm leavin after this song<end_line>
See you ain't gotta feel no way about Jay so long<end_line>
At least let me tell you why I'm this way, hold on<end_line>
I was conceived by Gloria Carter and Adnus Reeves<end_line>
Who made love under the sycamore tree<end_line>
Which makes me, a more sicker MC and my momma would claim<end_line>
At ten pounds when I was born I didn't give her no pain<end_line>
Although through the years I gave her her fair share<end_line>
I gave her her first real scare, I made up for birth when I got here<end_line>
She knows my purpose wasn't hurt cause I ain't perfect, I care<end_line>
But I feel worthless cause my shirts wasn't matchin my gear<end_line>
Now I'm just scratchin the surface cause what's buried under there<end_line>
Was a kid torn apart once his pop disappeared<end_line>
I went to school, got good grades, could behave when I wanted<end_line>
But I had demons deep inside that would raise when confronted<end_line>
Hold on<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Now all the teachers couldn't reach me and my momma couldn't beat me<end_line>
Hard enough to match the pain of my pop not seein me SO!<end_line>
With that disdain in my membrane<end_line>
Got on my pimp game, fuck the world, my defense came<end_line>
Then Dehaven introduced me to the game<end_line>
Spanish Jose introduced me to 'caine; I'm a hustler now<end_line>
My gear is in, and I'm in the in-crowd<end_line>
And all the wavy light-skinned girls is lovin me now<end_line>
My self-esteem went through the roof, man I got my swag'<end_line>
Got a vocal from this girl when her man got bagged<end_line>
Plus I hit my momma with cash from a show that I had<end_line>
supposedly - knowin nobody paid Jaz whack ass<end_line>
I'm gettin ahead of myself, by the way, I could rap<end_line>
That came second to me movin this crack<end_line>
Give me a second I swear, I would say about my rap career<end_line>
'til ninety-six came, niggaz I'm here - goodbye!<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Goodbye to the game all the spoils, the adrenaline rush<end_line>
Your blood boils, you in a spot, knowin cops could rush<end_line>
at you in the drop, you so easy to touch<end_line>
No two days are alike, except the 1st and 15th pretty much<end_line>
And trust, is a word you seldom hear from us<end_line>
Hustlers, we don't sleep, we rest one eye up<end_line>
And a drought could define a man when the well dries up<end_line>
You learn the worth of water<end_line>
Without work you thirst 'til you die - YUP!<end_line>
And niggaz get tied up for product<end_line>
And little brothers ring fingers get cut up<end_line>
to show mothers they really got 'em<end_line>
And this is the stress I lived with<end_line>
'til I decided to try this rap shit for a livin<end_line>
I pray I'm forgiven - for every bad decision I made<end_line>
Every sister I played - cause I'm still paranoid to this day<end_line>
And it's nobody fault, I made the decisions I've made<end_line>
This is the life I chose, or rather the life that chose me<end_line>
If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is whack<end_line>
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black<end_line>
If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is whack<end_line>
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black<end_line>
Now if you can't respect that, your whole perspective is whack<end_line>
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black<end_line>
If you can't respect that, your whole perspective is whack<end_line>
Maybe you'll love me when I fade to black..<end_line>
