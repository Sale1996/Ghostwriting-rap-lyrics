<verse_start>
Now, the end is near<end_line>
So I facethe final curtain<end_line>
My friends, I'll say it clear<end_line>
State my case<end_line>
Which I'm certain<end_line>
I lived a life that's full<end_line>
And I travelled each, and every highway<end_line>
and more<end_line>
Much more than thisI did it myyyyyy wayyyyyyy<end_line>
Let's try this one<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Uhh, yeah... gangsta nigga!<end_line>
Put my hustle down, tore the game up nigga<end_line>
Took your high score down, put my name up nigga<end_line>
Tore the doors down 'til the Hall of Fame is Jigga<end_line>
I did it my way<end_line>
That's right, it's a beautiful thing man!<end_line>
I did it my way -- Hovi baby!<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Momma's youngest and strongest, survived summers like saunas<end_line>
Mastered a corner like Deion in his uniform<end_line>
Pop hurtin assertive, flirted with death<end_line>
Damn near murdered before my first album hit the shelf<end_line>
Grandma's favorite, she could not understand<end_line>
how there's people in the world who wouldn't want me as a neighbor<end_line>
Has to explain to her, you think these folks want me in the penthouse<end_line>
as a reminder that I make top paper?<end_line>
Black entrepeneur, nobody did us no favors<end_line>
Nobody gave us shit, we made us<end_line>
The Rap Pack, I'm Sinatra, Dame's Sam Davis<end_line>
Big's the smart one on the low like Dean Martin<end_line>
We came in this game, not beggin niggaz pardon<end_line>
Demandin y'all respect, hand over a check<end_line>
And while y'all at it, hand over the jet<end_line>
We the reason they ain't hand over Def Jam so quick<end_line>
They new every year I was droppin new product<end_line>
I was raisin the stock up, while buildin the Roc up<end_line>
But that's alright, cause they knew they had to see us<end_line>
When it was time for us to re-up, make us multi-million-ires<end_line>
Je-je-jeah!<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Jeah!  "In My Lifetime"<end_line>
I caught smaller cases, but I had capital<end_line>
Hypocritic system let me right back at you<end_line>
You better hope a rich rapper never attacks you<end_line>
Not even that scratches you, 'specially if you black dude<end_line>
They don't give a shit unless the accused just happen to rap<end_line>
And they can look good by paintin him as bad news<end_line>
Cause in my past, I seen dudes get half of they views<end_line>
exposed to the curb and nobody said a word<end_line>
So imagine how disturbed I was<end_line>
When I seen how big they made my fight scene at the club<end_line>
Let me explain exactly how this shit was<end_line>
This nigga Un yo I scratched him, he went home without an aspirin<end_line>
But it's cool cause he's back friends, and half-inning is over<end_line>
It's in the past and I'm glad, now I'm back to bein Hova<end_line>
Me back with the chaffeur, laid back<end_line>
Helicopter seat, feat inclined, shit feelin like a sofa<end_line>
Helicopter meet me, Teta Verotake me over<end_line>
somewhere peaceful for the weekend now it's back to speakin of vultures<end_line>
So the next time that page six approaches us<end_line>
Here's a quote from Jay, nigga I did it my - way<end_line>
<verse_end>
