Young!  For life<end_line>
Once again it's the life, yessss<end_line>
It's intoxicatin man, y'all don't know why you do what you do<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
The allure of breakin the law<end_line>
Is always too much for me to ever ignore<end_line>
I gotta thing for them big body Benzes, it dulls my senses<end_line>
In love with a V-Dub engine<end_line>
Man I'm high off life, fuck it I'm wasted<end_line>
Bathing Ape kicks, Audemar Piguet wrists<end_line>
My women friend get tennis bracelets<end_line>
Trips to Venice, get they winters replaced with<end_line>
the sun, it ain't even fun no more I'm jaded<end_line>
Man, it's just a game, I just play it to play it<end_line>
I put my feet in the footprints left to me<end_line>
Without sayin a word, the ghetto's got a mental telepathy<end_line>
Man my brother hustled so, naturally<end_line>
Up next is me, but what perplexes me<end_line>
Shit I know how this movie ends, still I play<end_line>
the starrin role in "Hovito's Way"<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I'm like a Russian mobster, drinkin distilled vodka<end_line>
'Til I'm under the field with Hoffa, it's real<end_line>
Peel the top up like a toupee<end_line>
Mix the water, with the soda<end_line>
Turn the pot up make a souflee<end_line>
All of y'all can get it like group-ays in your 2-way<end_line>
I'm livin proof that crime do pay<end_line>
Say hooray to the bad guy, and all the broads<end_line>
puttin cars in they name for the stars of the game<end_line>
Puttin 'caine in they bras and their tomorrows on the train<end_line>
All in the name of love<end_line>
Just to see that love locked in chains and the family came<end_line>
over the house to take back, everything that they claimed<end_line>
Or even the worst pain is the distress<end_line>
Learnin you're the mistress only after that love gets slain<end_line>
And the anger and the sorrow mixed up leads to mistrust<end_line>
Now it gets tough to ever love a-gain<end_line>
But the allure of the game, keeps callin your name<end_line>
To all the allurists of the world, I feel your pain<end_line>
To all the Christies in every cities and Tiffany Lanes<end_line>
We all hustlers, in love with the same thang<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I never felt more alive than ridin shotgun<end_line>
In Cline's green 5 until the cops pulled guns<end_line>
And I tried to smoke weed to give me the fix I need<end_line>
what the game did to my pulse, with no results<end_line>
And you can treat your nose and still won't come close<end_line>
The game is a lightbulb with eleventy-million volts<end_line>
And I'm just a moth, addicted to the floss<end_line>
And doors lift from the floor and the tops come off<end_line>
By any means necessary, whatever the cost<end_line>
Even if it means lives is lost..<end_line>
And I can't explain why, I just love to get high<end_line>
Drink life, smoke the blueberry sky, blink twice<end_line>
I'm in the blueberry 5, you blink three times<end_line>
I may not even be alive<end_line>
I mean James Dean couldn't escape the allure<end_line>
Dyin young, leavin a good lookin corpse<end_line>
Of course<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Once again it's the life<end_line>
I said it's the life<end_line>
Once again it's the life - oh no!<end_line>
why I<end_line>
get souh-huh<end_line>
Hahahahahahaha - woo!<end_line>
<verse_end>
