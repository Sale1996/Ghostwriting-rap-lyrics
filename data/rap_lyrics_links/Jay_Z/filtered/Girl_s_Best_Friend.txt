<verse_start>
I took ya outta Jacob's in clusters<end_line>
Busters they wanted to rush us<end_line>
Love the way you sparkle when the sun touch ya<end_line>
When you blush you turn blue if your grade is right<end_line>
You can light up the whole room, turning day from night<end_line>
When the summertime is in and the tops are down<end_line>
With you around my neck we lock the whole block down<end_line>
It took shortsleeves and loungin' to understand<end_line>
The reason they call you ice, everybody freeze<end_line>
Ain't a pendant in the sun who can shine like you<end_line>
And that platinum in the charm who can blind like you<end_line>
The direct reason why niggas do they crimes they do<end_line>
I used to snatch the necklace right off them reckless fools<end_line>
Guess I was jealous that they was so next to you<end_line>
So I devoted half my time to invest in you<end_line>
The other half was spent on protecting you<end_line>
Cause you belong to me, now sing ya song for me<end_line>
C'mon<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I'm often with you so they wonder bout the juice I got<end_line>
I took you from the projects and an abusive pops<end_line>
From the bottom to the top<end_line>
The skateboard to the drop<end_line>
From the nada to the Prada<end_line>
I got ya like I got ya<end_line>
From the first time I put you round my neck and locked ya<end_line>
It was then I knew everywhere I went you'd follow<end_line>
Soon I spent every dolla you became my habit<end_line>
other brothers vice was smoke, mines was carats<end_line>
The more checks I got the more I laced my crew<end_line>
The rocks got bigger, watch face got blue<end_line>
Tricked a little bit, shit I lace my Boo<end_line>
Fuck it, my mistress I laced her too<end_line>
Cop my jewels twice, like deja vu<end_line>
If they ever met in the mall, it's ova ya'll<end_line>
Just the way I do, and either way you win<end_line>
I mean the thugs love ya when your girl's best friend<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
And the wedding band you love<end_line>
In the gold chain you thug<end_line>
Sometimes you given just because<end_line>
And the tennis bracelet means they want relations<end_line>
Know that they wanna fuck the only reason they give you up<end_line>
In the hands of goldiggas you never enough<end_line>
Rings, things,  just never enough<end_line>
With me and you together gon shine to the end<end_line>
I mean the thugs love ya but ya girls best friend<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Chorus til end<end_line>
<verse_end>
