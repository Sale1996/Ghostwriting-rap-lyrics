Weather we dribble out this motherfucker<end_line>
Rap metaphors and riddle out this motherfucker<end_line>
Work second floors, hospital out this motherfucker<end_line>
Some how we gotta get up out this motherfucker<end_line>
Some day the cops will kill a motherfucker<end_line>
I don't always want to be this drug dealing<end_line>
Motherfucker damn<end_line>
Wish I could take us all on this magic carpet ride<end_line>
Through the sky I<end_line>
Use to play the hall up fifth floor me and my boys we<end_line>
All poor getting high I<end_line>
seen the worst of the worst I deserve every blessing<end_line>
I received I'm from the dirt<end_line>
I planted my seed on unfertile land Myrtle Park<end_line>
Marcy, Flushing and Nostrand and<end_line>
Still I grew some how I knew the sun will shine through<end_line>
And touch my soul take hold of my hand<end_line>
Look man a tree grows in Brooklyn<end_line>

Twenty niggas on the block trying to chase that buck<end_line>
Nosey neighbors and haters keep their face on stuck<end_line>
Cops roll up on the pavement break the dice games up<end_line>
Behind smoke kids can't chase the ice cream truck<end_line>
Girls fighting over Rollie young boys hype things up<end_line>
Niggas fighting over Cold young boys light things up<end_line>
All the petty ass wars fuck the night scene up<end_line>
Remember Lil' Eddie man how he light mean up<end_line>
Then they wonder why we light green up<end_line>
Back to back steamers trying to relax but I can't<end_line>
I lean up ain't the L or the refer that steam up<end_line>
It's my head stress to the point I get a fever<end_line>
Thinking bout the block and all the mothers and kids<end_line>
That can't leave and how the Chinks gotta feed'em<end_line>
For the rest of their life fucking wings fried<end_line>
Vegetable rice<end_line>
No breakfast Cap'n Crunch at night<end_line>
Our kids eating lunch at night<end_line>
In their beds all bunched in tight<end_line>
No less than three or four<end_line>
Two by the foot two by the headboard<end_line>
Man I'm getting scared for them<end_line>
Thats how I feel for them<end_line>
And we gotta grip the shorties on the block<end_line>
All they do is smoke weed and drink forties<end_line>
Cop their quarties<end_line>
Enough to get the latest ROC, newest glock, and old Jordies<end_line>
