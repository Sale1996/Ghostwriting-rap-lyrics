This here's a ballad for all the fallen soldiers<end_line>
I'ma bout ta show you how a hustlers life<end_line>
and a soldier's life, parallel<end_line>
And the one thing they got in common is pain<end_line>
Picture split screen<end_line>
On one side we got a hustler getting ready for the block<end_line>
Other side you got the soldier getting ready for boot camp<end_line>
They're both at war<end_line>
Stay with us<end_line>

You lost him mama, the war's callin him<end_line>
Feel it's his duty to fall in line with all of them<end_line>
He's a soldier<end_line>
Rose through the ranks as the head of your household<end_line>
Now its time to provide bank, like he's supposed ta<end_line>
Now just remember while he's going to November<end_line>
There's part of him growing up<end_line>
His shirts soaks up your tears as he holds ya<end_line>
Your heart beatin so fast speeding his pulse up<end_line>
Yeah I know it sucks, Life aint a rosebud<end_line>
A couple of speed bumps, you gotta take your lumps<end_line>
Off to boot camp, the worlds facing terror<end_line>
Bin Laden been happenin in Manhattan<end_line>
Crack was anthrax back then, back when<end_line>
Police was Al'Qaeda to black men<end_line>
While I was out there hustling sinning with no religion<end_line>
He was off the wall killing for a living<end_line>

Days turn to nights, nights turn to years<end_line>
Years turn to, "How the fuck we make it in here?"<end_line>
My barracks average couple fights a day<end_line>
Get you locked in a hole wont see the light of day<end_line>
And I feel like I'm just writing my life away<end_line>
I never thought shit could end up quite this way<end_line>
There's a war going on outside no man is safe from<end_line>
I'm here for the good fight only the fakes run<end_line>
I'm here for the purple heart, if I cant take one<end_line>
For my team or my siblings whats my reason for living?<end_line>
I love my niggaz more then anything else<end_line>
This war's about my family, me needin the wealth<end_line>
You dont understand how useless as men we felt<end_line>
Till you become a 5 star general<end_line>
Shout out to my niggaz that's locked in jail<end_line>
P.O.W.'s thats still in the war for real<end_line>

Your baby boy is getting grown<end_line>
So your baby boy is moving on<end_line>
I've gotta chase<end_line>
If I'm gonna make it<end_line>
Your baby boy is getting grown<end_line>
So your baby boy is moving on<end_line>
I'm gonna make it<end_line>
Even if I gotta take it<end_line>
<verse_end>

Mama said pray your sons becoming a man<end_line>
This wars taxin to 'em like Uncle Sam<end_line>
He ain't gon' always make the right choice, understand<end_line>
Every choice that he make he makes it for his fam<end_line>
It's death before dishonor<end_line>
And if hes gone you should honor his memory<end_line>
Don't cry we all gonna die eventually<end_line>
But if he's locked in the penetentiary send him some energy<end_line>
They all winners to me<end_line>
<verse_end>
