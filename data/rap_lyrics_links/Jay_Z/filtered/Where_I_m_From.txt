<verse_start>
I'm from where the hammer's rung, New's cameras never come<end_line>
You and your man houndin' every verse in your rhyme<end_line>
where the grams is slung, niggas vanish every summer<end_line>
Where the blue vans would come, we throw the work in the can and run<end_line>
Where the plans was to get funds and skate off the set<end_line>
To achieve this goal quicker, sold all my weight wet<end_line>
Faced with immeasurable odds still I get straight bets<end_line>
So I felt some more something and you nothing check<end_line>
I from the other side with other guys don't walk to much<end_line>
And girls in the projects wouldn't fuck us if we talked too much<end_line>
So they ran up town and sought them dudes to trust<end_line>
I don't know what the fuck they thought, those niggas is foul just like us<end_line>
I'm from where the beef is inevitable, Summertime's unforgetable<end_line>
Boosters in abundance, buy a half-price sweater new<end_line>
Your world was everything, So everything you said you'd do<end_line>
You did it, Couldn't talk about it if you ain't lived it<end_line>
I from where niggas pull your car, and argue all day about<end_line>
Who's the best MC's, Biggie, Jay-Z, and Nas<end_line>
Where the drugs czars evolve, and thugs always are<end_line>
At each other's throats for the love of foreign cars<end_line>
Where cats catch cases, hoping the judge R and R's<end_line>
But most times find themselves locked up behind bars<end_line>
I'm from where they ball and breed rhyme stars<end_line>
I'm from Marcy son, just thought I'd remind y'all<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I'm from the place where the chruch is the flakiest<end_line>
And niggas is praying to god so long that they Atheist<end_line>
Where you can't put your vest away and say you'll wear it tomorrow<end_line>
Cause the day after we'll be saying, damn I was just with him yesterday<end_line>
I'm a block away from hell, not enough shots away from straight shells<end_line>
An ounce away from a triple beam still using a hand-held weight scale<end_line>
Your laughing, you know the place well<end_line>
Where the Liqour Store's and the base well<end_line>
And Government, fuck Government, niggas polotic themselves<end_line>
Where we call the cops the A-Team<end_line>
cause they hop out of vans and spray things<end_line>
And life expectancy so low we making out wills at eight-teen<end_line>
Where how you get rid of guys who step out of line, your rep solidifies<end_line>
So tell me when I rap you think I give a fuck who criticize?<end_line>
If the shit is lies, god strike me<end_line>
And I got a question, are you forgiving guys who live just like me?<end_line>
We'll never know<end_line>
One day I pray to you and said if I ever blow, Let 'em know<end_line>
Mistakes ain't exactly what takes place in the ghetto<end_line>
Promise fulfilled, but still I feel my job ain't done<end_line>
Cough up a lung, where I'm from, Marcy son, ain't nothing nice<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I'm from where they cross-over and clap boards<end_line>
Lost Jehovah in place of rap lords, listen<end_line>
I'm up the block, round the corner, and down the street<end_line>
From where the Pimps, Prostitutes, and the Drug Lords meet<end_line>
We make a million off of beats, cause our stories is deep<end_line>
And fuck tomorrow, as long as the night before was sweet<end_line>
Niggas get lost for weeks in the streets, twisted off weed<end_line>
And no matter the weather, niggas know how to draw heat<end_line>
Whether your four-feet or Minute size, it always starts out with<end_line>
Three dice and shoot the five<end_line>
Niggas thought they douce was live, now hit 'em with trips<end_line>
And I reached down for their money, pa forget about this<end_line>
This time around it's platinum, like the shit on my wrist<end_line>
And this glock on my waist, y'all can't do shit about this<end_line>
Niggas will show you love, That's how they fool thugs<end_line>
Before you know it your lying in a pool of blood<end_line>
