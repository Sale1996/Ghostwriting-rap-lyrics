<verse_start>
Pops sped off, left mom with a bundle of<end_line>
Joy, ya boy smacked dab in the jungle<end_line>
Took tunnel vision, but he would soon become a mogul<end_line>
But first he brought that crack back like a yo-yo<end_line>
Don't play with my yo-yo, loco niggas in the hood<end_line>
First niggas hating on me, it's all good<end_line>
I'm buying things like my shit don't stink, Gucci links in Gucci goose's<end_line>
Watching too many movies, bulletproof this<end_line>
Had some nerve, like pulling tooth'ses<end_line>
When your 16, coming through roofless<end_line>
Yea your boy "ruthless", like Ice Cube was<end_line>
Turn the whole city on, I'm the new blood<end_line>

You're about to experience someone so cold<end_line>
A journey seldom seen, the American dream<end_line>
From the bottom to the top of the globe they call me Hov<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Now I'm knee deep in the concrete<end_line>
Like a street's made a quicksand, it's beyond deep<end_line>
I got a "chemical romance", two left feet<end_line>
So now I dance with the devil, please G-O-D<end_line>
Save me from the "black parade", release me<end_line>
My life like Grant Theft Auto, PSP<end_line>

So sorry dear momma for your embarrasment<end_line>
But give me a couple years and pray I'll never sin again<end_line>
Got all these rival dealers trying to do me in<end_line>
And all these little rappers don't know how prepared for them I am<end_line>
I'm feelin like the world's against me Lord<end_line>
Call me crazy, but strangely I love the odds<end_line>
<verse_end>

Shooting air-balls at the basket<end_line>
What you call money, I pay more in taxes<end_line>
I got crowned king down in Africa<end_line>
Out in Niger, do you have any idea<end_line>
Sold out shows out in Seoul, Korea<end_line>
Jo'burg, Dublin, Tanzinia<end_line>
Lunch with Mandella, dinner with Cavalli<end_line>
Still got time to give water out to everybody<end_line>
Everybody, fall back<end_line>
Y'all rapping, I'm reenacting<end_line>
CNN, you see it's accurate<end_line>
