Look.. mind state of a gangster from the 40's<end_line>
meets the business mind of Motown's Berry Gordy<end_line>
Turned crack rock into a chain of 40/40's<end_line>
Sorry my jewelry is so gaudy<end_line>
Slid into the party with my new pair of Mauri's<end_line>
America, meet the gangster Shawn Corey<end_line>
Hey young world, wanna hear a story?<end_line>
Close your eyes and you can pretend you're me<end_line>
I'm cut from the cloth of the Kennedy's<end_line>
Frank Sinatra, havin dinner with the Genovese<end_line>
This is the genesis of a nemesis<end_line>
Mother Americas not witnessed since<end_line>
the Harlem Renaissance birthed black businesses<end_line>
This is the tale of lost innocence<end_line>
As the incense burns and the turntables turn<end_line>
And that Al Green plays<end_line>
I see my mother's afro<end_line>
As Mama taps her toes, as she rolls her J's<end_line>
And my papa just left the house<end_line>
in search of the killer of my Uncle Ray<end_line>
And she's trying to calm her nerves<end_line>
As I observe this is just one day<end_line>
And what tomorrow has in store<end_line>
we can never be sure so all we can do is... pray<end_line>

<verse_start>
As I head to my homeroom<end_line>
I observe the ruins<end_line>
Dope needles on the ground<end_line>
I hear a car go, "Vroom"<end_line>
Drug dealer in the BM with the top down<end_line>
As the girls start to giggle<end_line>
I ask, "Why you laugh?"<end_line>
They say, "You're too little"<end_line>
"One day you'll understand<end_line>
when you become a man<end_line>
'bout things you have to get you"<end_line>
Fast forward, freeze frame on my pistol, fistful of dollars<end_line>
Ignorance is so blissful<end_line>
I ain't choose this life, this life chose me<end_line>
Around here it's the shit that you just do<end_line>
I just left school<end_line>
The same BM is pulled over by the boys dressed blue<end_line>
They had their guns drawn<end_line>
Screaming, "Just move"<end_line>
"Or is there something else you suggest we can do?"<end_line>
He made his way to the trunk<end_line>
Opened it like, "Huh?"<end_line>
A treasure chest was removed<end_line>
Cops said he'll be back next month<end_line>
What we called corrupt, he calls payin dues<end_line>
Now when the rules is blurred<end_line>
As they is and were<end_line>
What am I to do.. but pray<end_line>
Pray the Lord forgive me<end_line>
Pray He guides me by for what I'm 'bout to go through... pray<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Geah.. anywhere there's oppression<end_line>
The drug profession<end_line>
flourishes like beverages<end_line>
Refreshing, ahhh! Sweet taste of sin<end_line>
Everything I seen, made me everything I am<end_line>
Bad drug dealer or victim, I beg<end_line>
What came first? <end_line>
Moving chickens or the egg?<end_line>
This I why I be so fresh<end_line>
I'm trying to beat life 'cause I can't cheat death<end_line>
Treat shame with shamelessness<end_line>
And stainless at anuses<end_line>
You know the game this is?<end_line>
Move coke like Pepsi<end_line>
Don't matter what the brand name is<end_line>
I stand behind mine<end_line>
Everything I do, I'm a man behind mine<end_line>
I'm not an angel, I'm sure<end_line>
But every night before I lay<end_line>
I drop my knees to the floor and I pray<end_line>
<verse_end>
