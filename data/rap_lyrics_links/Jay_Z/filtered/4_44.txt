Look, I apologize, often womanize<end_line>
Took for my child to be born, see through a woman's eyes<end_line>
Took for these natural twins, to believe in miracles<end_line>
Took me too long for this song, I don't deserve you<end_line>
I harass you out in Paris<end_line>
Please come back to Rome you make it home<end_line>
We talked for hours when you were on tour<end_line>
Please pick up the phone, pick up the phone<end_line>
Said Don't embarrass me instead of be mine<end_line>
That was my proposal for us to go steady, that was your 21st birthday <end_line>
You mature faster than me, I wasn't ready <end_line>
So I apologize, I've seen the innocence<end_line>
Leave your eyes I still mourn this death<end_line>
I apologize for all the stillborns<end_line>
'Cause I wasn't present, your body wouldn't accept it<end_line>
I apologize to all the women whom I<end_line>
Toyed with you're emotions because I was emotionless<end_line>
And, I apologize, 'cause at your best, you are love<end_line>
And because, I fall short of what I say I'm all about<end_line>
Your eyes leave with the soul that your body once housed<end_line>
And you stare blankly into space<end_line>
Thinkin' of all the time you wasted in on all this basic shit<end_line>
So..... I apologize<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I apologize, our love was, one for the ages and, I contained us<end_line>
And, all this ratchet shit and, we more expansive now<end_line>
Not meant to cry and die alone in these mansions<end_line>
Or, sleep with our back turned<end_line>
We're supposed to, vacay 'til our backs burn<end_line>
We're supposed to, laugh 'til our hearts stops<end_line>
And then we, in a space where the dark stops<end_line>
And let love, light the way<end_line>
And like the men before me  I cut off my nose to spite my face<end_line>
I never wanted another woman to know something about me that you didn't know <end_line>
I promised I cried I couldn't hold<end_line>
I suck at love I think I need a do over<end_line>
I will be emotionally available if I invited you over<end_line>
I stew over, what if?<end_line>
You over, my shit?<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
And if my children knew, I don't even know what I would do<end_line>
If they ain't look at me the same, I would probably die with all the shame<end_line>
You did what with who?<end_line>
What good is a ménage à trois when you have a soulmate?<end_line>
You risked that for Blue?<end_line>
If I wasn't a superhero in your face<end_line>
My heart breaks for the day I had to explain my mistakes<end_line>
And the mask goes away, and Santa Claus is fake<end_line>
And you go online and see<end_line>
For Blue's tooth, the tooth fairy didn't pay<end_line>
<verse_end>
