	Dear God.. how can I explain myself?<end_line>
Oh God bless me indeed<end_line>
	When I'm so confused<end_line>
Enlarge my territory<end_line>
Place your love and protection over me at all times<end_line>
	Help me!<end_line>
Keep me away from evil<end_line>
	Somebody answer me!<end_line>
Allow me not to cause pain<end_line>

Police in the background, screamin put the thing down<end_line>
That's how hard I was trying to put my thing down<end_line>
Si-rens ringin out, old ladies screamin out<end_line>
All this attention for me and I'm barely sixteen now<end_line>
.. it's feelin like a dream now<end_line>
Handcuffed, roughed up, I'm tossed in the bing now<end_line>
I'm lyin next to fiends now, that's the end of the story<end_line>
Let me bring y'all niggaz back to the very first scene now<end_line>
December 4th, a child is born<end_line>
Before I knew it, had my pops trousers on<end_line>
That's how we do it when the man of the house is gone<end_line>
You either, stand or fall, I chose to stand<end_line>
The hawk outside, so I blow my hand<end_line>
It's a cold cold world but I overstand<end_line>
Tryin to stay focused but I feel hopeless damn<end_line>
Can't cope with bein broke, I'm a man - c'mon<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Now the only thing left is more spirit to roam free<end_line>
.. cause ain't no goin home for me<end_line>
It's a cold cold world but I blew my hand<end_line>
I drew first cause I knew that man<end_line>
I knew what he would do if I didn't draw first<end_line>
And I couldn't stand the thought of my momma steppin foot inside a church<end_line>
All I try to do is try to get up out the dirt<end_line>
Guess he's tryin to do the same, told me get up out his turf<end_line>
I wanted to talk to him, but that shit'd never work<end_line>
We was cut from the same cloth and what was under his shirt was his<end_line>
momma's rent, his young brother's clothes<end_line>
My nephew's food, and with that I sqooze<end_line>
.. and with that I froze<end_line>
Now my life is frozen in time behind these iron poles<end_line>
And this story is told, for young soldiers<end_line>
who never choose the life we chose<end_line>
<verse_end>
