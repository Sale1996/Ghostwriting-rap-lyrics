It's the things that you do<end_line>
That make me feel so...<end_line>

You know the flow sicka, know Jigga, mo' sicka now right<end_line>
You know what me and Swizz's shit sound like<end_line>
Crazed and demonic, uh without blazin chronic<end_line>
Product of Reaganomics<end_line>
You know that motherfuckin stoop raised me<end_line>
Ringin in da hoops but I was too lazy<end_line>
School made me sick, teachers said I was too crazy<end_line>
Low and behold, it's the new and improved Jay-Z<end_line>
Let me explain this to you baby<end_line>
I spent nights out, days in<end_line>
Niggaz was blazing, twelve noon where I was raised in<end_line>
I felt caged in but kept roaming<end_line>
Prayed for the Day of Atonement<end_line>
Married to the streets no date of annulment<end_line>
It seems every time it comes up<end_line>
They postpone it<end_line>
So I kept my chrome at the waist<end_line>
Waiting for the omen<end_line>
Savoring the moment and now you know<end_line>
The reason that I flow the way I flow baby<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
You know I move like an ounce<end_line>
Bottled up like crack<end_line>
That's how I make you bounce like that<end_line>
Defy Webster's words they can't pronounce like that<end_line>
That's why no other rapper got a sound like that<end_line>
Trap, trap of my life<end_line>
Flashback, kill niggaz<end_line>
Rap skills unmatched, Jigga man baby<end_line>
I can't entertain it sometimes I can't explain it<end_line>
God given, gifts of a soul for hard living<end_line>
Far be it from me to question Allah's wisdom<end_line>
Could've been lost in the system<end_line>
Instead I'm involved with the rhythm<end_line>
I dodged prison, came out unscathed from car collisions<end_line>
I know I must be part of some mission<end_line>
Shit I used take it for granted<end_line>
Why they placed me on this planet<end_line>
I would ask myself while writin raps to myself<end_line>
But right there under my nose<end_line>
Was the flow of all flows<end_line>
Not a demon but a rose in the cement, come on<end_line>

You know I've traveled through zones<end_line>
Homes spazzed like a bad back<end_line>
I came into this game on Jaz's back<end_line>
I jumped off stood on my own two like boom, that's that<end_line>
Yeah I'm here to show and prove<end_line>
Don't matter to me the Garden or flowin on Clue<end_line>
Whatever niggas wanna do - it's alright with me<end_line>
Whether you big or bossy, jig or flossy<end_line>
Dusty or musty, sober or saucy<end_line>
Broker than Todd Bridges, richer than Bill Cosby<end_line>
Forgive me for my arrogance or you still salty?<end_line>
Past on to the next life and you still haunt me<end_line>
I'mma keep doing me unfortunately<end_line>
I make the club rock, make thugs pop guns<end_line>
Make old folks do the bus stop; can't stop son<end_line>
Shit I give you what's hot and what's not, I never knew<end_line>
