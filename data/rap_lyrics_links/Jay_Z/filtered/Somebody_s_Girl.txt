Ummmmmm.. I don't mean no harm<end_line>
But your boy young Hov' got a mean ol' arm<end_line>
Got all the young ladies wanna lean on him<end_line>
And I don't turn them away, I'm like - bring them on<end_line>
Now - where's her man is not my concern<end_line>
It's not what I'm worried about, I'm just tryin to hurry her out<end_line>
Clear her whole area out<end_line>
And bring this whole party little nearer to my house<end_line>
Now - where's her spouse?  I don't know<end_line>
So, I don't ask, I don't probe<end_line>
I just - get in 6, get out on Rov'<end_line>
Let her, sip on Cris', go out on tours<end_line>
Now - back at the lab, I'm actin bad<end_line>
Cause the, pool is warm, a booze is on<end_line>
Just a - select few, the fools are gone<end_line>
It's slow jams and the grooves is on, groove on<end_line>
<verse_end>

Uhh, is it my fault they call me young heat rock<end_line>
Hardhead, go through walls like sheet rock<end_line>
And she's comin with me, when the beat stop<end_line>
When the party is done, I party with hon<end_line>
Now - is it my fault you neglect your broad<end_line>
and she wanna party with me, no ex at all?<end_line>
No ex-boyfriend, no ex involved<end_line>
Just the highway exit that we exit off<end_line>
And I - fall back, I let her talk<end_line>
I inquire sometime, I admire her mind<end_line>
I - like her wit, I'm lovin her shoes<end_line>
I'm a alternative rap, I'm playin the blues<end_line>
I'm a thorough street nigga never breakin the rules<end_line>
And her man's shortcomin is turnin me into somethin<end_line>
that of which she has never seen<end_line>
So she wanna crossover where the grass is green, knahmean?<end_line>
<verse_end>

The moral of the story if you love your bitch<end_line>
you better - hold your hoe, hug your bitch<end_line>
You better - slow your roll, trick some bread<end_line>
When she wanna go out, you like Craig and 'em said<end_line>
"See ya when I see ya," now she's callin me up<end_line>
And I'm like, "Geah, of course I wanna chill"<end_line>
Now she with the real, and you all fed<end_line>
Like, "I'ma crack her motherfuckin fo'head!"<end_line>
