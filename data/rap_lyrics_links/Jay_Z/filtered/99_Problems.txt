If you havin girl problems I feel bad for you son<end_line>
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one<end_line>
I got the Rap Patrol on the gat patrol<end_line>
Foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed<end_line>
Rap critics that say he's "Money, Cash, Hoes"<end_line>
I'm from the hood stupid, what type of facts are those?<end_line>
If you grew up with holes in your zapatoes<end_line>
You'd celebrate the minute you was havin dough<end_line>
I'm like fuck critics, you can kiss my whole asshole<end_line>
If you don't like my lyrics, you can press fast forward<end_line>
Got beef with radio if I don't play they show<end_line>
they don't play my hits - well I don't give a shit, SO!<end_line>
Rap mags try and use my black ass<end_line>
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads, fuckers!<end_line>
I don't know what you take me as<end_line>
Or understand the intelligence that Jay-Z has<end_line>
I'm from, rags to riches, niggaz I ain't dumb<end_line>
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one - hit me!<end_line>

The year is ninety-four, in my trunk is raw<end_line>
In my rearview mirror is the motherfuckin law<end_line>
Got two choices y'all, pull over the car or<end_line>
bounce on the Devil, put the pedal to the floor<end_line>
And I ain't tryin to see no highway chase with Jake<end_line>
Plus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case<end_line>
So I, pull over to the side of the road<end_line>
"Son do you know why I'm stoppin you for?"<end_line>
Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low<end_line>
Or do I look like a mindreader sir?  I don't know<end_line>
Am I under arrest or should I guess some mo'?<end_line>
"Well you was doin fifty-five in the fifty-four;<end_line>
 license and registration and step out of the car -<end_line>
 are you carryin a weapon on you?  I know a lot of you are"<end_line>
I ain't steppin out of shit, all my papers legit<end_line>
"Well do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?"<end_line>
Well my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back<end_line>
And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that<end_line>
"Aren't you sharp as a tack!  You some type of<end_line>
 lawyer or somethin, somebody important or somethin?"<end_line>
Child I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit<end_line>
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit<end_line>
"Well we'll see how smart you are when the canine comes"<end_line>
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one - hit me!<end_line>

Now once upon a time, not too long ago<end_line>
A nigga like myself had to strongarm a hoe<end_line>
This is not a hoe in the sense of havin a pussy<end_line>
But a pussy havin no God damn sense, try an' push me<end_line>
I try to ignore him, talk to the Lord<end_line>
Pray for him, but some fools just love to perform<end_line>
You know the type, loud as a motorbike<end_line>
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight<end_line>
And only thing that's gon' happen is I'ma get to clappin and<end_line>
he and his boys gon' be yappin to the Captain<end_line>
And there I go, trapped in the Kit-Kat again<end_line>
Back through the system with the riff-raff again<end_line>
Fiends on the floor, scratchin again<end_line>
Paparazzis with they cameras, snappin them<end_line>
D.A. try to give a nigga shaft again<end_line>
Half a mill' for bail cause I'm African<end_line>
All because this fool was harassin them<end_line>
Tryin to play the boy like he's saccharin<end_line>
But ain't nuttin sweet bout how I hold my gun<end_line>
I got 99 problems, bein a bitch ain't one - hit me!<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
