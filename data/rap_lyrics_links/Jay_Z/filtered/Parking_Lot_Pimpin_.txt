Continental T's, no tense like I got a thick stab<end_line>
Big cigar, old money, when I drop it it's so funny<end_line>
Six-four switches, slam doors on 6's<end_line>
Big trucks when I wanna fuck and it's time to get ass<end_line>
I turn automobiles to hotels on wheels<end_line>
I got money for a room it's just the fact that I'm trill<end_line>
Bitches love when I cruise up the boulevard<end_line>
They have contests to guess which car I'ma pull out the yard<end_line>
They know I, come for dolo and pull off with a broad<end_line>
Spin away, spend a day tryin to pull menage<end_line>
Just mackin this gorgeous; sunlight hit the ice it's flawless<end_line>
Run lights like I'm the king of New York, I'm lawless<end_line>
Bitches, they wanna hang like plaques in the office<end_line>
Cause I push black Porsches, Benz's and Jaguars-es<end_line>
When the rag's off it, gat on my lap, I'm that cautious<end_line>
Never trust grimy-ass New Yorkers<end_line>
'Specially when you're sittin on 20's they get nauseous<end_line>
Standin in the Azure with white Air Forces<end_line>

Stash box, push +Hot Wheel+ like +Matchbox+<end_line>
Bitches wanna push my world, they flash box<end_line>

Lookin through the rearview and Mac was wylin<end_line>
