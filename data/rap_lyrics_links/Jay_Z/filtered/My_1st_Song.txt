Uhh, uhh, yes, yes<end_line>
Y'all wanna know, why he don't stop<end_line>
Y'all wanna know, why he don't flop<end_line>
Let me tell you pe-eople why<end_line>
Came from the bottom of the block I<end_line>
When I was born, it was sworn, I was never gon' be shit<end_line>
Had to pull the opposite out this bitch<end_line>
Had to get my ri-ide on<end_line>
Eyes on the prize, Shawn knew I had to<end_line>
Had to had to get these chips<end_line>
Had to make moves like Olajuwon<end_line>
Started out sellin dimes and nicks<end_line>
Graduated to a brick<end_line>
No exaggeration, my infatuation with the strip<end_line>
Legendary like a schoolboy<end_line>
Crushin merely nearly every every chick<end_line>
Heavy shit - that's how schoolboy got whipped<end_line>
And got left on some "Just +Me, Myself and I+"<end_line>
On some Trugoy shit<end_line>
Had your boys threw place up, to a place of no return<end_line>
Had to play with fire and get burned<end_line>
Only way the boy ever gon' learn<end_line>
Had to lay way in the cut, 'til I finally got my turn<end_line>
Now I'm on top in the spot that I earned<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Like I never rode in a limo<end_line>
Like I just dropped flows to a demo<end_line>
Like it's ninety-two again and<end_line>
And I got O's in the rental<end_line>
Back in the Stu' again, no prob' livin was a whole lot simpler<end_line>
When you think back, you thought that<end_line>
you would never make it this far, then you<end_line>
take advantage of the luck you handed<end_line>
Or the talent, you been given<end_line>
Ain't no, half steppin, ain't no, no slippin<end_line>
Ain't no different from a block that's hidden<end_line>
Gotta get it while the getting's good<end_line>
Gotta strike while the iron's hot, 'fore you stop<end_line>
Then you gotta bid it, good riddance<end_line>
Goodbye, this is my second major breakup<end_line>
My first was, with a pager<end_line>
With a hooptie, a cookpot, and the 'CAINE<end_line>
This one's with the stool, with the stage, with the fortune<end_line>
Maybe not the fortune, but certainly the FAME<end_line>
<verse_end>
