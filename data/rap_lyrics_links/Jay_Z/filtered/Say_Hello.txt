I ain't playin, life's short so I aim<end_line>
I ain't waitin 'til lifers start betrayin 'em<end_line>
It's twice as hard to get a job as payin 'em<end_line>
So I ain't payin attention to what you're sayin<end_line>
Raindrops keep fallin on my brain<end_line>
Cousin in the drop all flames<end_line>
I'm so hot even if the weather change<end_line>
I don't have no top, I'm insane<end_line>
'Member dark-skinned Jermaine<end_line>
Who swayed in the rain, we sorta kinda the same<end_line>
'Cept, I'm no lame, and you gonna know my name<end_line>
Before I go the world gon' feel my pain<end_line>
They sayin, I'm a bad guy, why's that?<end_line>
Cause when my back's against the wall, nigga I react<end_line>
Secretly though, I know you admire that<end_line>
You wish you had the balls to fire back, brrrap<end_line>
Say hello, uhh uh, hello, uhh uh<end_line>
You wish you had the balls to fire back, brrap!<end_line>

I ain't no ordinary nigga<end_line>
Look around, this ain't what ordinary gets ya<end_line>
Extraordinary figures<end_line>
I'm an extraordinary nigga<end_line>
Before my name became Jigga<end_line>
Before I sang I had that thang on slippers<end_line>
Can't complain 'bout what they ain't gon' give ya<end_line>
That ain't gon' get ya shit, might as well give up<end_line>
Or get up, get out and get somethin nigga<end_line>
Get a job my nigga, or get to dumpin<end_line>
Only God can judge him, only he without sin<end_line>
Tell me if my means, justified my ends<end_line>
'Til then, I'm just gon' fly in the Benz<end_line>
Wire my friends, through Western Union<end_line>
Shhhhh, suprisin<end_line>
My system knockin, here comes the bad guy again<end_line>
Say hello, uhh uh, hello, uhh uh<end_line>
Hello, uhh here comes the bad guy again<end_line>

... let me tell you what I ain't<end_line>
We ain't thugs for the sake of just bein thugs<end_line>
Nobody do that where we grew at, nigga duh<end_line>
The poverty line we not above<end_line>
So I come to mask and gloves cause we ain't feelin the love<end_line>
We ain't doin crime for the sake of doin crimes<end_line>
We movin dimes cause we ain't doin fine<end_line>
One out of three of us is locked up doin time<end_line>
You know what this type of shit can do to a nigga moms<end_line>
My mind on my money, money on my mind<end_line>
If you owe me ten dollars you ain't givin me nine<end_line>
Y'all ain't give me 40 acres and a mule<end_line>
So I got my glock 40 now I'm cool<end_line>
And if Al Sharpton is speakin for me<end_line>
Somebody, give him the word and tell him I don't approve<end_line>
Tell him I remove the curses<end_line>
If you tell me our schools gon' be perfect<end_line>
When Jena Six don't exist<end_line>
Tell him that's when I'll stop sayin bitch, BEEEITCH~!<end_line>
