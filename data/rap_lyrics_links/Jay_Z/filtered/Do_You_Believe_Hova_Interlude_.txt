Well, I'm the ghetto's answer to Trump<end_line>
I'm cancer to the Hamptons<end_line>
20 million a wop, brand sac and mansions<end_line>
Increase the noise pollution, as soon as I land in<end_line>
Don't even trust uppity white folks<end_line>
Keep the cannon tuck<end_line>
Niggas trying to lean on Jay, shots gonna stand you up<end_line>
Glocks gonna pop, ya not understandin much<end_line>
I hustle for the thuggest<end_line>
Well, now I hustle for the rust, like fuck it baby <end_line>
I just love it<end_line>
Chicks now say they like the way I thug it<end_line>
Since my album dropped,my stock grows like I went public<end_line>
Ladies I love ya<end_line>
But I love my freedom more<end_line>
I love my niggas, love to see them ball<end_line>
I love Bean's and Bleek<end_line>
Them niggas like my Peter and Paul<end_line>
My disciples, and that's right we coming for the title.....<end_line>
Do you believe, it's Hova the God<end_line>
