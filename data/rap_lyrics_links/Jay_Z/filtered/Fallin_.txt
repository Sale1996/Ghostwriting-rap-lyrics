<verse_start>
Said where I would stop be-<end_line>
fore' I even started<end_line>
When I get to one brick<end_line>
Then the game I would depart with<end_line>
Got to one brick then I looked to the sky like<end_line>
Sorry God I lied<end_line>
But give me one more try<end_line>
Got the two bricks<end_line>
New cars new whips<end_line>
But niggas never learn till they<end_line>
End up in the news clip<end_line>
The irony of selling drugs<end_line>
Is sort of like you using it<end_line>
Guess it's two sides to what<end_line>
Substance abuse is<end_line>
Can't stop won't stop<end_line>
Addicted to this new shit<end_line>
Brand new convertibles<end_line>
I'm so roofless<end_line>
Front row fight night<end_line>
See how big my tube is<end_line>
Fuck HD nigga<end_line>
See how clear my view is?<end_line>
... But there's a price for overdoing it<end_line>
Doin' it this big will put you on the map<end_line>
Stick-up kids is out to tax<end_line>
Plus the FBI boys with the cameras in the back<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
When you should've fall back<end_line>

Fallin' and applauding<end_line>
And They screaming at the screen<end_line>
Damn you fucked up like your favorite movie scene<end_line>
Godfather Goodfellas Scarface Casino<end_line>
You seen what that last run did to Denerio<end_line>
And he can't beat the odds<end_line>
Can't cheat the Gods<end_line>
Can't blow to hard<end_line>
Life's a deck of cards<end_line>
Now ya tumbling it's humbling<end_line>
Ya fallin' ya mumbling<end_line>
Under ya breath like you knew this day was coming<end_line>
.... Now let's pray that arm candy<end_line>
That you left ya ex for stay down and come in handy<end_line>
Cause come January it gets cold<end_line>
When the letters start to slow<end_line>
And ya commissary low<end_line>
And lawyers screams appeal<end_line>
Only thinking about a bill<end_line>
And ya chances are nil<end_line>
Damn gravity's ill.....<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
And ya can't get up<end_line>
All you do is push-up<end_line>
Pull-up sit-up<end_line>
Locked down the town now belongs to the squares<end_line>
Who said they won't make the same mistake that got you there<end_line>
And ya arm candy sweet on em'and the women<end_line>
That you left for this heffer got a college degree coming<end_line>
Bad news keeps comin'<end_line>
Hard to keep something on ya stomach<end_line>
Your sick 'bout what ya life is becoming<end_line>
... But your use-to's has-beens<end_line>
Ragging bad 'bout all the new dudes<end_line>
Talking tough on the Youtube<end_line>
Bout what you use to do<end_line>
But that's old school to the new crew<end_line>
They doin' numbers like Sudoku<end_line>
There're the new you<end_line>
And it's damn near inevitable<end_line>
They'll experience deja vu too<end_line>
Fight and you'll never survive<end_line>
Run and you'll never escape<end_line>
So just fall for Grace<end_line>
<verse_end>
