You're my best friend's sister, grown woman and all<end_line>
But you see how I am around girls; I ruin 'em all<end_line>
Plus your mom call me son, around you since I was small<end_line>
Shit I watched you mature - nah, this ain't right<end_line>
But still when your boyfriend ditched you, life's a bitch you cried<end_line>
Over my right shoulder I told you to wipe your eyes<end_line>
Take your time when you likin a guy<end_line>
Cause if he sense that your feelings too intense, it's pimp or die<end_line>
I bought you earrings on your birthday<end_line>
Drove you to college your first day<end_line>
It must be sad, though it hurts to say<end_line>
We could never be a item, don't even like him<end_line>
You deserve better - this is ugly; Gina, please don't love me<end_line>
There's better guys out there other than me<end_line>
Like a lawyer or a doctor with a Ph.D<end_line>
Think of how upset your mother and brother would be<end_line>
if they found that you was huggin me<end_line>
My conscience is fuckin with me<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Man, I look in the eyes of a..<end_line>
this.. a kid that stole life and me together..<end_line>
We're tryin, really tryin to make it work<end_line>
I'm young, and I ain't ready, and I told you<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
It ain't like, I ain't tell you from day one, I ain't shit<end_line>
When it comes to relationships, I don't have the patience<end_line>
Now it's too late, we got a little life together<end_line>
and in my mind I really want you to be my wife forever<end_line>
But in the physical it's like I'ma be trife forever<end_line>
A different girl every night forever; told you to leave<end_line>
but you're stubborn and you love him and,<end_line>
no matter what despite all the fuckin and the cheatin,<end_line>
you still won't leave him, now you're grievin<end_line>
And I feel bad, believe me<end_line>
But I'm young and I ain't ready, and this ain't easy<end_line>
Wasn't fair to tell you to wait, so I told you to skate<end_line>
You chose not to, now look at the shit we gotta go through<end_line>
Doin a fight, throw in a fuss, you the mother of my baby<end_line>
I don't want you to hate me, this is about us<end_line>
Rather me; I ain't ready to be what you want me to be<end_line>
Because I love you, I want you to leave, please<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Mm... listen ma<end_line>
I mean, I seen you workin two or three jobs<end_line>
Daddy left... I I thought I was makin things better<end_line>
I made it worse<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Dear ma, I'm in the cell, lonely as hell<end_line>
Writin this scribe, thinkin bout how you must feel inside<end_line>
You tried to teach me better, but I refused to grow<end_line>
God damn I ain't the young man that you used to know<end_line>
You said the street claim lives, but I wanted things like<end_line>
bling bling ice I was wrong in hindsight<end_line>
Shit we grew apart, try to blame it on your new spouse<end_line>
I know it hurt like hell the day you kicked me out<end_line>
But your house is your house, I ain't respect the rules<end_line>
I brought crack past your door, beefed with rival crews<end_line>
And who wants to be the mother of a son who sold drugs<end_line>
Co-workers saw me on the corner slingin Larry Love<end_line>
Meanwhile, you workin hard like, two or three jobs<end_line>
Tryin to feed me and my siblings, makin an honest livin<end_line>
Who am I kiddin I, call myself easin the load<end_line>
I made the load heavy, I need money for commissary<end_line>
Try to understand, please<end_line>
<verse_end>
