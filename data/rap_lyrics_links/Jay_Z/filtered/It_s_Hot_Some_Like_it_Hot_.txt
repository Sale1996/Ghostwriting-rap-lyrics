Give my ladies dick, my young hoes pee-pee<end_line>
Hits in a row like MJ; "Hee-hee!"<end_line>
Since I was waist height, late night, bustin in the clouds<end_line>
Runnin wild, comin home late, cussin out my mouth<end_line>
Niggaz said, "Bryan leave your cousin in the house"<end_line>
Everytime we play the Dozen, he's buggin out<end_line>
While y'all was playin yo-yo, I was sittin on low pros<end_line>
Dippin the po-po, gettin that dough-dough<end_line>

Give you chest pains, leg sprains absolutely<end_line>

<verse_start>
Thirty-eight revolve like the sun round the Earth<end_line>
Try to play hard get you found round the dirt<end_line>
Six shell casings found round your shirt<end_line>
in surround sound from the hearse<end_line>
Jigga Man, trigger man, hit your man up<end_line>
Six shots, hit the pole, hit the van up<end_line>
Kidnap grown folks get them grands up<end_line>
Timbaland, hot shit, get them hands up<end_line>

Chorus 2X<end_line>
