<verse_start>
We played it cool at the pool of the Canc√∫n, VMA<end_line>
Confidence you exude make the fools stay away<end_line>
Me, I played my room, let the fools have they say<end_line>
Fate, had me sittin next to you on the plane<end_line>
And I knew straight away, uh<end_line>
The next time we would speak was like two years away<end_line>
You had a man, you shut it down until you two had a break<end_line>
... I bet that dude rued the day<end_line>
You kept me up on the phone while you were away<end_line>
You came back, I let you set the date<end_line>
Nobu on the plate<end_line>
I brought my dude to play it cool, my first foolish mistake<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I never knew a lo-, lo-, lo-, love like this<end_line>
Gotta be special for me to write this<end_line>
Queen, I ain't mean no disrespect<end_line>
But the way I network, it's hard for me to connect<end_line>
My first time in the ocean went exactly as you'd expect<end_line>
Meanwhile you goin hard, jumpin off the top deck<end_line>
A leap of faith, I knew I was up next<end_line>
I never told you, but I told a few people we wed<end_line>
Me, I'm off to Rome, you goin back home instead<end_line>
My first time in my life a live nigga felt dead<end_line>
You came back, I had to act like it was cool in my head<end_line>
Thoughts of jumpin the broom, a player never been swept<end_line>
<verse_end>
