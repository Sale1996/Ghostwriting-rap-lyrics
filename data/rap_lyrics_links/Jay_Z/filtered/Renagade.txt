<verse_start>
say that I'm foolish I only talk about jewels<end_line>
Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?<end_line>
See I'm influenced by the ghetto you ruined<end_line>
That same dude you gave nothin, I made somethin doin<end_line>
what I do through and through and<end_line>
I give you the news - with a twist it's just his ghetto point-of-view<end_line>
The renegade; you been afraid<end_line>
I penetrate pop culture, bring 'em a lot closer to the block where they<end_line>
pop toasters, and they live with they moms<end_line>
Got dropped roasters, from botched robberies niggaz crotched over<end_line>
Mommy's knocked up cause she wasn't watched over<end_line>
Knocked down by some clown when child support knocked<end_line>
No he's not around - now how that sound to ya, jot it down<end_line>
I bring it through the ghetto without ridin 'round<end_line>
hidin down duckin strays from frustrated youths stuck in they ways<end_line>
Just read a magazine that fucked up my day<end_line>
How you rate music that thugs with nothin relate to it?<end_line>
I help them see they way through it - not you<end_line>
Can't step in my pants, can't walk in my shoes<end_line>
Bet everything you worth; you lose your tie and your shirt<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I had to hustle, my back to the wall, ashy knuckles<end_line>
Pockets filled with a lot of lint, not a cent<end_line>
Gotta vent, lot of innocent of lives lost on the project bench<end_line>
Whatchu hollerin? Gotta pay rent, bring dollars in<end_line>
By the bodega, iron under my coat, feelin braver<end_line>
Doo-rag wrappin my waves up, pockets full of hope<end_line>
Do not step to me - I'm awkward, I box leftier often<end_line>
My pops left me an orphan, my momma wasn't home<end_line>
Could not stress to me I wasn't grown; 'specially on nights<end_line>
I brought somethin home to quiet the stomach rumblings<end_line>
My demeanor - thirty years my senior<end_line>
My childhood didn't mean much, only raisin green up<end_line>
Raisin my fingers to critics; raisin my head to the sky<end_line>
Big I did it - multi before I die<end_line>
No lie, just know I chose my own fate<end_line>
I drove by the fork in the road and went straight<end_line>
<verse_end>
