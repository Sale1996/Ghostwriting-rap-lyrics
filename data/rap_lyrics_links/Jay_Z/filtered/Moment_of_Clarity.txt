Pop died, didn't cry, didn't know him that well<end_line>
Between him doin heroin and me doin crack sales<end_line>
With that in the eggshell, standin at the tabernacle<end_line>
Rather the church, pretendin to be hurt, wouldn't work<end_line>
So a smirk was all on my face<end_line>
Like damn, that man's face is just like my face<end_line>
So pop, I forgive you for all the shit that I lived through<end_line>
It wasn't all your fault, homey you got caught<end_line>
Into the same game I fought, that Uncle Ray lost<end_line>
My big brothers and so many others I saw<end_line>
I'm just glad we got to see each other<end_line>
Talk and re-meet each other<end_line>
Save a place in heaven 'til the next time we meet forever!<end_line>

Music business hate me cause the industry ain't make me<end_line>
Hustlers and boosters embrace me and the music I be makin<end_line>
I dumbed down for my audience to double my dollars<end_line>
They criticized me for it yet they all yell "HOLLA!"<end_line>
If skills sold, truth be told, I'd probably be<end_line>
lyrically, Talib Kweli<end_line>
Truthfully I wanna rhyme like Common Sense<end_line>
But I did five mill' - I ain't been rhymin like Common since<end_line>
When your cents got that much in common<end_line>
And you been hustlin since, your inception<end_line>
Fuck perception go with what makes sense<end_line>
Since I know what I'm up against<end_line>
We as rappers must decide what's most impor-tant<end_line>
And I can't help the poor if I'm one of them<end_line>
So I got rich and gave back, to me that's the win/win<end_line>
So next time you see the homey and his rims spin<end_line>
Just know my mind is workin just like them...<end_line>
... rims, that is<end_line>

My homey Sig' was on a tear where no tears should fall<end_line>
Cause he was on the block where no squares get off<end_line>
See in my inner circle all we do is ball<end_line>
'Til we all got triangles on our wall<end_line>
Ain't just rappin for the plat-i-num, y'all record<end_line>
I recall, cause I really been there before<end_line>
Four scores and seven years ago prepared the flow<end_line>
Prepared for war, I should fear no man<end_line>
You don't hear me though<end_line>
These words ain't just 'pared to go<end_line>
In one ear, out the other ear, no!  Yo<end_line>
My balls and my word is alls I have<end_line>
Whatchu gon' do to me nigga, scars or scab?<end_line>
Whatchu gon' box me homey?  I can dodge a jab<end_line>
Three shots couldn't touch me, thank God for dat<end_line>
I'm strong enough to carry Biggie Smalls on my back<end_line>
And the whole BK, nigga holla back<end_line>
<verse_end>
