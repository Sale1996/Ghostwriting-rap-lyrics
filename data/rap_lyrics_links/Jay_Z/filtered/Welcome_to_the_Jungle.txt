Black Axl Rose, move halfs and wholes<end_line>
Come down to the jungle, just ask for Hov<end_line>
Move blocks and squares, move apples and pears<end_line>
Work pots and pans, must to cop me some Airs<end_line>
My uncle died, my daddy did too<end_line>
Paralyzed by the pain, I can barely move<end_line>
My nephew gone, my heart is torn<end_line>
Sometimes I look to the sky, ask why I was born<end_line>
My faith in God, every day is hard<end_line>
Every night is worse, that's why I pray so hard<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
My dreams is big, reality set in<end_line>
Let off a clip from a automatic weapon<end_line>
Through shots in the door, it died in Vegas<end_line>
Though it fought so hard, I knew it wouldn't make it<end_line>
I'm a tortured soul, I live in disguise<end_line>
Rest in peace to the leader of the Jackson 5<end_line>
I died in my sleep, I'm still "Big Pimpin"<end_line>
I ball at the mall, beginning of the endin<end_line>
Where the fuck is the sun? It's been a while<end_line>
Momma look at your son, what happened to my smile?<end_line>
My tears is tatted, my rag in my pocket<end_line>
I'm just lookin for love, I know somebody got it<end_line>
Champagne for the pain, weed for the low<end_line>
God damn I'm so high, where the fuck did I go?<end_line>
I'm losing myself, I'm stuck in the moment<end_line>
I look in the mirror, my only opponent<end_line>
Where the fuck is the press? Where the fuck is the Pres?<end_line>
Either they know or don't care I'm fuckin depressed<end_line>
No crying in public, just lyin to judges<end_line>
Riskin my life I'm already dyin so fuck it well<end_line>
<verse_end>
