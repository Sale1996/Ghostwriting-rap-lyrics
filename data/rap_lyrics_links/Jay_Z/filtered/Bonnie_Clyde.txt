Look for me! Young, B<end_line>
Cruisin down the westside - high, way<end_line>
Doing what we like to do - our, way<end_line>
Eyes behind shades, this necklace the reason<end_line>
all of my dates been blind dates<end_line>
But today, I got my thoroughest girl wit me<end_line>
I'm mashin the gas, she's grabbin the wheel, it's true to the heart<end_line>
She rides with me - the new Bobby and Whitney<end_line>
Only time we don't speak is during "Sex and the City"<end_line>
She gets Carrie fever, but soon as the show is over<end_line>
She's right back to being my soldier<end_line>
Cause mami's a rider, and I'm a roller<end_line>
Put us together, how they gon' stop both us?<end_line>
What ever she lacks, I'm right over her shoulder<end_line>
When I'm off track mami is keepin me focused<end_line>
So let's, lock this down like it's supposed to be<end_line>
The '03 Bonnie and Clyde, Hov' and B<end_line>

<verse_start>
The problem is, you dudes treat the one that you lovin<end_line>
with the same respect that you treat the one that you humpin<end_line>
Now they 'bout nothin - if ever you mad about somethin<end_line>
It won't be that; oh no it won't be that<end_line>
I don't be at, places where we comfy at<end_line>
With no be-atch; oh no you won't see that<end_line>
And no, I ain't perfect - nobody walkin this earth's surface is<end_line>
But girlfriend, work with the kid<end_line>
I keep you workin at Hermes, Birkin bag<end_line>
Manolo Blahnik Timbs, aviator lens<end_line>
600 drops, Hercedes Benz<end_line>
The only time you wear Burberry to swim<end_line>
And I don't have to worry, only worry is him<end_line>
She do anything necessary for him<end_line>
And I do anything necessary for her<end_line>
so don't let the necessary occur, yep!<end_line>
