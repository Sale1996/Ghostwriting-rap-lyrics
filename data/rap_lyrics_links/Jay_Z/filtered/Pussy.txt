I know this girl we call her Sweet Cooch Brown<end_line>
Hands down, mami had the bombest pussy in town<end_line>
One dip in the girl pool, that's all it took<end_line>
One sample of the snapple, and ya ass was whupped<end_line>
Have you buyin' Gucci sandals, matchin' pocket books<end_line>
Blowin' up her beeper ringin' her phone off the hook<end_line>
Ball players they spit money, rappers they spit time<end_line>
All a while they both clamin' that they never spent a dime<end_line>
Business guys, she would victimize<end_line>
Have 'em paying rent on condos in the Miami high rise<end_line>
We ask her, who pussy is this look her right in her eyes<end_line>
She said this pussy's yours daddy, tell 'em nothin' but lies<end_line>
They didn't believe it, but they wanted to, needed to<end_line>
She had the type of body, that you didn't want leavin' you<end_line>
So they ignored all her flirtin' ways<end_line>
And put a ring on her finger I'm like, Earth to Dave<end_line>
