<verse_start>
Who be, in a Japanese restaurant, eating sushi<end_line>
Drinking saki, it's me, and my mami with the doobie<end_line>
Cutie, smellin like Tiaka, half-Phillipine thing<end_line>
For now, let's call her Suki, got me this booty bangin<end_line>
Properly, in Versace pants, cocky bow-legged stance<end_line>
A thing of beauty, watch me, body crazy<end_line>
Tits Firm like Nature, Foxy, Nas and AZ<end_line>
Truly reason to bug the toolie and keep laced in jewelry watch me<end_line>
Girlie tried to lure me and lock me you gotta get up early<end_line>
Cause who's gettin played is not me<end_line>
"Surely you jest," she said, "if you thought I was purely<end_line>
out for the bucks you woulda bucked stuck and dropped me"<end_line>
I said maturely, "You right<end_line>
but better safe than sorry, but for the lovebirds<end_line>
can move to the suburbs, I need to double check your story<end_line>
To make sure that you one of a kind<end_line>
And you deserve to be my Sunshine"<end_line>

A year gone, and she seein things most chicks only<end_line>
hear in songskeep in gear phenom<end_line>
Lots of ice in the air, round the neck the charm<end_line>
Risked a four to life bid to keep that shit on her arm<end_line>
Keep her impressed at all times, cats would love to creep<end_line>
just to say they crept with mine, slept with mine, she said<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I ain't deaf nor blind, niggaz stressin<end_line>
Hatin cause they less than mine, they wanna sex me<end_line>
We chose each other, you actin like you chose me<end_line>
They oppose you then, they oppose me<end_line>
We could creep at a low speed, the gat in the hosiery<end_line>
Double cross you they got to triple cross me<end_line>
Uh-huh<end_line>
(One more thing:<end_line>
 If I ever go broke, would you hit the block for me?) Fo' sho'<end_line>
I put that on my life<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
If I needed would you, give me your kidneys?<end_line>
Catch a case you catch it with me?<end_line>
Pawn your jewlery to come get me?<end_line>
Catch me with a chick, forgive me?<end_line>
They spread rumors, will you defend me, tooth and nail?<end_line>
They try to frame me, will you be there, till the truth prevail?<end_line>
(But would you be the same dude, when you blow the roof off sales<end_line>
 that you was, throwin rocks, at the Roof at 12, nigga?)<end_line>
This is the truth I shell, till the loot gets frail<end_line>
I put this on my nephews, from the smallest to the pale<end_line>
Me and you ballin, from the heavens, or the hell<end_line>
Won't let you hit the ground if I'm fallin myself<end_line>
Now picture me leavin you in this cold world, rollin for delf<end_line>
It's me and you in this old girl, we takin the belt<end_line>
From the lows, to the highs, to the foes we shine<end_line>
Just continue to be my Sunshine<end_line>
<verse_end>
