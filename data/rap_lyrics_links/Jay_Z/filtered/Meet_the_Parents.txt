<verse_start>
Woo!  Uhh, uhh<end_line>
It's "The Gift & the Curse"<end_line>
Uhh, uhh yea<end_line>
First they love me then they hate me then they love me again<end_line>
.. they love me again<end_line>
Let's take a trip down.. I gotcha<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Let's take a trip down memory, lane at the cemetary<end_line>
Rain grey skies, seems at the end of every<end_line>
young black life is this line, "Damn - him already?<end_line>
Such a good kid," got us pourin Henn' already<end_line>
Liquor to the curb for my, niggaz up above<end_line>
When it, cracks through the pavement that's my way of sendin love<end_line>
So, give Big a hug, tell Aa-liyah I said hi<end_line>
'Til the next time I see her, on the other side<end_line>
He was just some thug that, caught some slugs<end_line>
And we loved him cause, in him we, saw some of us<end_line>
He walked like ussss, talked like ussss<end_line>
His back against the wall, nigga fought like us - damn<end_line>
Poor Isis, that's his momma name<end_line>
Momma ain't strong enough to raise no boy, what's his father name?<end_line>
Shorty never knew him, though he had his blood in him<end_line>
Hot temper, momma said he act just like her husband<end_line>
Daddy never fucked with him, so the streets raised him<end_line>
Isis blamin herself, she wish she coulda saved him<end_line>
Damn near impossible, only men can raise men<end_line>
He was his own man, not even him can save him<end_line>
He put his faith in a, thirty-eight in his waist<end_line>
But when you live by the gun you die by the same fate<end_line>
End up, dead before thirty-eight and umm<end_line>
That's the life of us raised by winter, it's a cold world<end_line>
Old girl turned to coke, tried to smoke her pain away<end_line>
Isis, life just, ended on that rainy day<end_line>
When she got the news her boy body could be viewed<end_line>
down at the City Morgue, opened the drawer, saw him nude<end_line>
Her addiction grew, prescription drugs, shift and brew<end_line>
Angel dust, dipped in WOO!<end_line>
She slipped into, her own fantasy world<end_line>
Had herself pregnant by a different dude<end_line>
But reality bites and, this is her life<end_line>
He wasn't really her husband, though he called her wife<end_line>
It was just this night when, moon was full<end_line>
And the stars were just right, and the dress was real tight<end_line>
Had her soundin like Lisa Lisa - I wonder if I take you home<end_line>
will you still love me after this night?<end_line>
Mike was the hardhead from the around the way<end_line>
that she wanted all her life, shit she wanted all the hype<end_line>
Used to hold on tight when he wheelied on the bike<end_line>
He was a Willie all her life he wasn't really the one to like<end_line>
It was a, dude named Shy who would really treat her right<end_line>
He wanted to run to the country to escape the city life<end_line>
But I-sis, liked this, Broadway life<end_line>
She loved the Gucci sneakers, the red green and whites<end_line>
Hangin out the window when she first seen him fight<end_line>
She was so turned on that she had to shower twice<end_line>
How ironic it would, be some fight that<end_line>
turned into a homicide that'll alter their life<end_line>
See Mike at thirty-two was still on the scene<end_line>
Had a son fifteen that he never saw twice<end_line>
Sure he saw him as an infant, but he dissed on him like<end_line>
"If that was my son, he would look much different.<end_line>
See I'm light-skinnded and that baby there's dark<end_line>
so it's, momma's baby; poppa's maybe."<end_line>
Mike was still crazy out there runnin the streets<end_line>
Had his old reliable thirty-eight gun in his reach<end_line>
It's been fourteen years, him and Isis ain't speak<end_line>
He runnin around like life's a peach, 'til one day<end_line>
he approached this thug that, had a mean mug<end_line>
And it looked so familiar that he called him "Young Cuz"<end_line>
Told him, get off the strip but the boy ain't budge<end_line>
Instead he pulled out a newer thirty-eight snub<end_line>
He clearly had the drop but the boy just paused<end_line>
There was somethin in this man's face he knew he seen before<end_line>
It's like, lookin in the mirror seein hisself more mature<end_line>
And he took it as a sign from the almighty Lord<end_line>
You know what they say about he who hesitates in war<end_line>
He who hesitates is lost<end_line>
He can't explain what he saw before his picture went blank<end_line>
The old man didn't think he just followed his instinct<end_line>
Six shots into his kid, out of the gun<end_line>
Niggaz be a father, you're killin your son<end_line>
Six shots into his kid, out of the gun<end_line>
Niggaz be a father, you killin your sons<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Meet the parents..<end_line>
