I heard motherfuckers saying they made Hov<end_line>
Made Hov say, "Ok so, make another Hov"<end_line>
Niggaz wasn't playing they day role<end_line>
So we parted ways like Ben and J-Lo<end_line>
I shoulda been did it but I been in a daze though<end_line>
I put friends over business end of the day though<end_line>
But when friends, business interests they go<end_line>
Ain't nothing left to say though<end_line>
I guess we forgot what we came fo'<end_line>
Shoulda stayed in food and beverage<end_line>
Too much flossing<end_line>
Too much Sam Rothstein<end_line>
I ain't a bitch but I gotta divorce them<end_line>
Hov have to get the shallow shit up off him<end_line>
And I ain't even want to be famous<end_line>
Niggaz is brainless to unnecessarily go through these changes<end_line>
And I ain't even know how it came to this<end_line>
Except that fame is<end_line>
The worst drug known to man<end_line>
It's stronger than, heroin<end_line>
When you could look in the mirror like, "There I am"<end_line>
And still not see, what you've become<end_line>
I know I'm guilty of it too but, not like them<end_line>
You lost one<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I don't think it's meant to be, be<end_line>
But she loves her work more than she does me<end_line>
And honestly, at twenty-three<end_line>
I would probably love my work more than I did she<end_line>
So, we, ain't we<end_line>
It's me, and her<end_line>
'Cause what she prefers over me, is work<end_line>
And that's, where we, differ<end_line>
So I have to give her<end_line>
Free, time, even if it hurts<end_line>
So breathe, mami, it's deserved<end_line>
You've been put on this earth to be<end_line>
All you can be, like the reserves<end_line>
And me? My time in the army, it's served<end_line>
So I have to allow she, her, time to serve<end_line>
The time's now for her<end_line>
In time she'll mature<end_line>
And maybe we, can be, we, again like we were<end_line>
Finally, my time's too short to share<end_line>
And to ask her now, it ain't fair<end_line>
So yeah, she lost one<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
My nephew died in the car I bought<end_line>
So under the belief it's partly my fault<end_line>
Close my eyes and squeeze, try to block that thought<end_line>
Place any burden on me, but please, not that lord<end_line>
But time don't go back, it goes forward<end_line>
Can't run from the pain, go towards it<end_line>
Some things can't be explained, what caused it?<end_line>
Such a beautiful soul, so pure, shit!<end_line>
Gonna see you again, I'm sure of it<end_line>
'Til that time, little man I'm nauseous<end_line>
Your girlfriend's pregnant, the lord's gift<end_line>
Almost lost my faith, that restored it<end_line>
It's like having your life restarted<end_line>
Can't wait for your child's life, to be a part of it<end_line>
So now I'm child-like, waiting for a gift<end_line>
To return, when I lost you, I lost it<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Lose one, let go to get one<end_line>
Left one, lose some to win some<end_line>
Sorry I'm a champion, Colleek, you're a champion<end_line>
You lost one<end_line>
<verse_end>
