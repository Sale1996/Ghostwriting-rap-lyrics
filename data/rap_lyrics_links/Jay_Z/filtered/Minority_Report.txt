People was poor before the hurricane came<end_line>
When the downpour poured it was like when Mary J. sang<end_line>
Everyday it rained, so everyday the pain<end_line>
But ignored 'em, and showed 'em the risk was to blame<end_line>
But life is chain, cause and effected<end_line>
Niggaz off the chain, because they affected<end_line>
It's a dirty game, it's whatever is effective<end_line>
From weed to sellin' 'caine, gotta put that in effect<end_line>
Wouldn't you loot? If you didn't have the loot<end_line>
Baby needed food and you was stuck on the roof<end_line>
And helicopters swoop down just to get a scoop<end_line>
Through his telescopic lens, but he didn't scoop you<end_line>
For the next five days, no help ensued<end_line>
They called you a refugee because you seek refuge<end_line>
And the Commander-in-Chief, just flew by<end_line>
Didn't stop, 'though he had a couple seats<end_line>
Just proved Jet blue, he's not, jet flew by the spot<end_line>
But if he ran outta jet fuel and just dropped<end_line>
Huh, that'd've been somethin' to watch<end_line>
Helicopters doin' fly-bys to take a couple shots<end_line>
Couple portraits, then ignored him<end_line>
He'd be just another Bush surrounded by a couple orchards<end_line>
Poor kids, just 'cause they was poor kids<end_line>
Left them on they porches, same old story in New Orleans -<end_line>
Silly rappers, 'cause we got a couple Porsches<end_line>
MTV stopped by to film our fortresses<end_line>
We forget the unfortunate<end_line>
Sure, I ponied up a mil' but I didn't give my time<end_line>
So in reality I didn't give a dime<end_line>
or a damn, I just put my monies in the hands<end_line>
of the same people that left my people stranded<end_line>
Nothin' but a bandit, left my folks abandonned<end_line>
Damn, money we gave just a band aid<end_line>
Can't say we better on than we was before<end_line>
In synopsis, this is my Minority Report<end_line>
Can't say we better on than we was before<end_line>
