Geah.. whassup?<end_line>
Where's all my street niggaz, project niggaz<end_line>
Real niggaz, worldwide<end_line>
Let's reflect.. e'rybody got a story<end_line>
We all ghetto B - here's mine <end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
See I was -- born in sewage, born to make bomb music<end_line>
Flow tight like I was born Jewish<end_line>
Used the streets as a conduit - I kept arms <end_line>
38 longs inside my mom's Buick<end_line>
At any given moment Shawn could lose it, be on the news<end_line>
Iron cuffs - arms through it; or stuffed with embalmin fluid<end_line>
Shit, I'm goin through it - mom dukes too<end_line>
Tears streamin down her pretty face, she got her palms to it<end_line>
My life is gettin too wild<end_line>
I need to bring some sort kinda calm to it<end_line>
Bout to lose it; voices screamin "Don't do it!"<end_line>
It's like '93, '94, bout the year <end_line>
that Big and Mag dropped; and "Illmatic" rocked <end_line>
outta every rag drop, and the West had it locked<end_line>
Everybody doin 'em, I'm still scratchin on the block<end_line>
like "Damn; I'ma be a failure"<end_line>
Surrounded by thugs, drugs, and drug - paraphenalia<end_line>
Cops courts, and their thoughts is to derail us<end_line>
Three time felons in shorts with jealous thoughts<end_line>
Tryin figure where your mail is, guesstimate the weight you sellin<end_line>
So they can send shots straight to your melon; wait!<end_line>
It gets worse, baby momma water burst<end_line>
Baby came out stillborn, still I gotta move on<end_line>
Though my heart still torn, life gone from her womb<end_line>
Don't worry, if it was meant to be, it'll be -- soon<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
This can't be life..<end_line>
