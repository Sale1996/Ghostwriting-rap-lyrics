Two little niggaz bakin, talkin bout whippin cakes<end_line>
Get clothin and big cheddar, hopin it gets better<end_line>
We had no knowledge of this shit we just was with whatever<end_line>
In front of your buildin clockin, thought I was makin a killin<end_line>
Right in front of your children, eightball in my side pocket<end_line>
They was corrupt too, disrespectin the fiends I used to<end_line>

Parallel lives and jew-els held high<end_line>
To the Range, to the Rove, get exchanged, for your souls<end_line>
You know how the game goes, slang to get G's<end_line>

Get your shit scarred fuckin with my sick squad<end_line>
