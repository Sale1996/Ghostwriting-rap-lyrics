I storm in, she storm out<end_line>
It's like the "War of the Roses" goin on in my house<end_line>
It's a little seperation but I know how to fix the situation<end_line>
Mami just sufferin from love deprevation<end_line>
So I gotta give her thug reperations<end_line>
Put it in the life until love leg is shakin<end_line>
Slow and passionate, 'til we forget what happens<end_line>
Then we laughin and we back friends<end_line>

Girlfriend didn't believe me when I said I'd be back in a little<end_line>
Cause I had the Chris T on with the crease in the middle<end_line>
Plus a fresh cut and the freezin icicles<end_line>
on my wrist, on my hand, that's when shit hit the fan<end_line>
Said, "You never spend timey, what's up with that?"<end_line>
Translated it means<end_line>
Hit it hard from the back<end_line>
Yeah she hid my car keys<end_line>
And forced me to fall asleep to her heartbeat<end_line>

Sex so intense, all that's on my mind<end_line>
It ain't feel this good since the very first time<end_line>
I'm pullin her close, she's pullin away<end_line>
I'm tryin to kiss her mouth but she keeps turnin her face<end_line>
Cute sex game like our very first date<end_line>
We ain't know each other well enough, we had to wait<end_line>
But oh!  I know just where your hot spot at<end_line>
You can not deny that, so do not try that<end_line>
I do not buy that..<end_line>
<verse_end>
