Life is but a dream to me<end_line>
I don't wanna wake up<end_line>
Thirty odd years without having my cake up<end_line>
So I'm about my paper<end_line>
24/7, 365,366 in a leap year<end_line>
I don't know why we here<end_line>
Since we gotta be here<end_line>
Life is but a beach chair<end_line>
Went from having shabby clothes<end_line>
Crossing over Abbey Roads<end_line>
Hear my angels singing to me<end_line>
Are you happy HOV?<end_line>
I just hope im hearing right<end_line>
Karma's got me feearing life<end_line>
Colleek are you praying for me<end_line>
I got deamons in my past<end_line>
So i got daughters on the way<end_line>
If the prophecy's correct<end_line>
Then the child should have to pay<end_line>
For the since of a father<end_line>
So i barter my tommorows<end_line>
Against my yesterdays<end_line>
In hopes that she'll be OK<end_line>
And when im no longere here<end_line>
The shade of face from the flare<end_line>
I'll give her my share of Carol's Daughter<end_line>
and a shiny new beach chair<end_line>

Life is but a dream to me<end_line>
Gun shots sing to these<end_line>
Other guys but lullabys<end_line>
Don't mean a ting to me<end_line>
I'm not afraid of dyng<end_line>
I'm afraid of not trying<end_line>
Everyday hit every wave<end_line>
Like im Hawaiian<end_line>
I don't surf the net<end_line>
No i never been on myspace<end_line>
Too busy letting my voice vibrate<end_line>
Carving out my space<end_line>
In this world of fly girls<end_line>
Cutthroats &  diamond cut ropes I twirls<end_line>
Benzs round corners<end_line>
Where the sun don't shine<end_line>
I let the wheels give a glimpse<end_line>
Of hope of one's grind<end_line>
Some said HOV, how you get so fly<end_line>
I said from not being afraid to fall out the sky<end_line>
My physical's shell<end_line>
So when i say farewell<end_line>
My soul will find an even<end_line>
Higher plane to dwell<end_line>
So fly you shall<end_line>
So have no fear, just know that<end_line>
Life is but a beach chair<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Life is but a dream can't mimic my life<end_line>
I'm the thinnest cut slice<end_line>
Intercut, the winner's cup<end_line>
With winters rough enough<end_line>
TO interrupt life<end_line>
That's why I'm both<end_line>
The saint & the sinner<end_line>
This is Jay everyday<end_line>
No compromise<end_line>
No compass comes with this life<end_line>
Just eyes<end_line>
So to map it out<end_line>
You must look inside<end_line>
Sure books can guid you<end_line>
But your heart defines you<end_line>
You corason is what brought us home<end_line>
In great shape like Heidi Klum<end_line>
Maricon, I am on<end_line>
Permanent Vaca<end_line>
Life is but a beach chair<end_line>
This song is like a Hallmark card<end_line>
Until you read each here<end_line>
So till she's here<end_line>
And she declaired<end_line>
The aire<end_line>
I will be prepared<end_line>
A blueprint for you to print<end_line>
A map so you can back<end_line>
A guide for your eyes<end_line>
And so you won't lose scent<end_line>
I'll make a stink for you to think<end_line>
I ink these verses full of prose<end_line>
So you won't get connect out of 2 cent<end_line>
My last will and testament I leave my heir<end_line>
My share of Roc-AFella Records and a shiny new beach chair<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I hear my angels sing<end_line>
<verse_end>
