We treat this rap shit just like, handlin weight<end_line>
What they want we give it to em, what they abandon we take<end_line>
Hit a rapper with consignment, let him know it's at stake<end_line>
Put his ass in the studio, let him cook up a cake<end_line>
When it's hot, get on my money spot in every state<end_line>
Like the wiz in Camelot, the mom-and-pop's is the gate<end_line>
But first we scope shit, advertise in every area<end_line>
Let the fiends know hey, we got some dope shit<end_line>
Gon' need a middle man, so we look to radio<end_line>
Let em test the product, give em a promo show<end_line>
Just a breeze, not enough to catch a real vibe<end_line>
Then we drop a maxi single and charge em two for five<end_line>
Ain't tryin to, kill em at first just, buildin clientele<end_line>
So when the album drops the first weeks it's on sale<end_line>
But when demand grows it's time to expand yo<end_line>
You don't want no garbage papi it's ten grand per blow, fo' sho'<end_line>

You need another fix, you better cop these last two bricks<end_line>

Never pitchin for a label, Jigga's the hook-up<end_line>
You know my shit is fish scale, y'all niggaz is cook up<end_line>
Just blow up, scream my name from Brooklyn to Da-kota<end_line>
They know my shit stretch without the baking soda<end_line>
Went from an eighth, to a quarter, to a half a key<end_line>
Priority's work wasn't right so I switched factories<end_line>
