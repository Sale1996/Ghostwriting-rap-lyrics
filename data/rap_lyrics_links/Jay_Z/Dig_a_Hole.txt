[Jay-Z]
Dig a hole bury yourself nigga
Go ahead, keep going I got some nice dresses for you guys

[Hook: Sterling Simms] and (Jay-Z)
Told you to get your money when you see a boss coming (Yes)
Thought shit was funny but what you see now (what you see now)
Nothing left to accomplish I done came out of Compton (kingÂ… Compton)
And what's that you talking 'bout we gon' see now (we gon see now)

Dig a hole (dig a hole)
Dig a hole (dig a hole) go ahead
Dig a hole (dig a hole) motherfucker
Dig a hole (dig a hole) bury yourself
Dig a hole
Dig a hole
Dig a hole

[Verse 1]
I'm still here mon frere I know the cross I bear
They like, that's why they call you Hov I'm like yea
I'm like air, little shots go through me, won't tear
Want tissue no tears, no tissue not an issue
Don't cry for me I peep these niggaz from deep
Got a front row seat even if you don't speak
Silent partner I hear you loud and clear
You left your fingerprint you aint got to be there
I'm just waiting till you dig a hole big enough to put your whole body in
then I'm gon' body them
Its nothing but a hobby to him
Simple as serve and volley to him
Niggaz like, "Hov, why don't you get at old boy?"
Why kill a puppet and leave Gepetto alive?
Why not wait to catch 'em all together?
This way you dig one big hole, one time

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
How's niggaz dissing me? (I made it possible)
For niggaz to make history (How is this possible)
Please explain the shit to me (How is it logical)
Have we forgotten our history (Let's open our Bibles)
It's like the disciples dissin Jesus becoming his rivals
Shunning the one thing that they owed their life to
You let that man hype you to go against your idol
Knowing good and goddamn well this what I do
Think I'm in the office I'm off my grind
That's how kids become orphans (you lost your mind?)
I keep my enemies close, I give 'em enough rope
They put themselves in the air I just kick away the chair

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Hov gon' get you I ain forget your lil' disrespect
No ho, Daddy gon' spank you for that shit you said
It's hard to do when you got nothing to prove
Everybody know you better you in a lose lose
Cuz even when you win ultimately you lose
Real niggaz like, "Why Hov talking to dude?"
You selling little tools, only time you went plat
My chain was on your neck, that's a natural fact
So I'm praying that it spills outside of the booth
That's when ya'll niggaz outside of your truth
Outside of your league that's not what you do
Niggaz throwing Roc signs outside of your coupe (hah)
Don't look at Hov like he done something wrong to 'em
Cuz he's onto 'em, he just took what belonged to him
Niggaz playing checkers with chess playing Hov
This game is over I don't know if you know
You in a Hole!

[Hook]
