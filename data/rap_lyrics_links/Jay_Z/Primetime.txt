[Intro: Jay-Z]
We havin the time of our lives babe
Turn the music up
Prime time
Uhh

[Jay-Z]
Yeah, prime time, beat by Dion
Our third eon, that's what the fuck we on
Mo' money, forty year old phenom
Our fifteen minutes of fame has stretched beyond
At forty-two be better than twenty-fours
I carried the four-five, mastered forty-eight laws
Still wearing my twenty-three's they can't fuck with the boy
As far as them 16's, I'm +23+ of it all
Prime time, ridin that six deuce
The nine-eleven, I only subtract the roof
Started in eighty-eight, got warm in ninety-two
I landed in ninety-six, that's the year I came through
I hit the club, ordered some Grey Goose
Switched it for Ciroc to give Puff's stock a boost
New money, I found the fountain of youth
I'm headed to Miami to fuck up the Fontaine Bleu
A case of Ace, make it two
Nigga we rollin, beat the deuce
The night is young, what the fuck we gon' do? (Ooh)

[Chorus: Kanye West]
The night is young, what the fuck you wanna do, huh?
The night is young, what the fuck we gon' do, huh?
The night is young, what you really wanna do, huh?

[Kanye West]
Prime time, baskin in the lime
Cassius in his prime, colorin out of the line
Cause they don't want nobody that's colored out of the lines
So I'm late as a muh'fucker, colored people time
Damn Yeezy, they all gotta be dimes?
Well, Adam gave up a rib so mine better be prime
Niggaz gon' kill me, I swear they better be lyin
I never live in fear, I'm too out of my mind
Prime time, never hit these heights
I mean it's like, it's like our first first class flight
I'm trippin on it, socks on marble floors I'm slippin on it
Champagne, I'm sippin on it, shit taste different don't it?
You know what... you right~!
It's like the best damn champagne I had in my life
"When you comin home?" That's a text from my wife
I told her, run a bubble bath
And float in that motherfucker like a hovercraft
And soak in that muh'fucker til I call you back
I mean who says shit like that, and doesn't laugh? {Baby}

[Chorus]
