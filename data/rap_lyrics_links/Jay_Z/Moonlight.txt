[Intro: Jay-Z]
Yeah, got a lil' cold so bear with me
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
We stuck in +La La, Land+
Even when we win, we gon' lose
We got the same fuckin' flows
I don't know who is, who
We got the same fuckin' watch
She don't got time to choose
We stuck in +La La, Land+
We got the same fuckin' moves

[Jay-Z]
Y'all fuck the same fuckin' chicks
I'm in the skrt with ya - yeah, right
I'm in the skrt with ya - cool story
I'm on the 'ja - 'nough of this
Look, I know killers, you no killer, huh?
Bathing Ape maybe not a gorilla, huh?
Glorified seat filler, huh?
Stop walkin' around like y'all made "Thriller", huh?
Fake Dracos all in the videos
We show 'em, we shoot 'em in my city though
I don't post no threats on the Internet
I just pose a threat, blame Lenny S. for that
I don't be on the 'Gram goin' HAM
Givin' information to the pork, that's all +spam+
Please don't talk about guns
that you ain't never gon' use
Y'all always tell on y'all self
I'm just so fuckin' confused~!

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
Y'all stuck in +La La, Land+
Even when we win, we gon' lose
Y'all got the same fuckin' flows
I don't know who is, who
We got the same fuckin' watch
She don't got time to choose
We stuck in +La La, Land+
We got the same fuckin' moves

[Jay-Z]
Y'all niggas still signin' deals? Still?
After all they done stole, for real?
After what they done to our Lauryn Hill?
And y'all niggas is 'posed to be trill?
That's real talk when you behind on your taxes
And you pawned all your chains and they run off with your masters
And took it to Beverly Hills while, we in Calabasas
And my head is scratchin' cause that shit is backwards
And that shit ain't right
Lucian is cool but Lucian don't write, Doug ain't this tight so
Fuck what we sellin', fuck is we makin'?
'Cause their grass is greener cause they always rakin' in mo'
Nah nah nah nah
Nah, nah
