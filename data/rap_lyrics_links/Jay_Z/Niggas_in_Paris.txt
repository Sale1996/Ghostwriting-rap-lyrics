{*slowed*} Ball so hard muh'fuckers wanna fine me

So I ball so hard muh'fuckers wanna fine me, but first niggaz gotta find me
What's 50 grand to a muh'fucker like me? Can you please remind me?
Ball so hard - this shit crazy, y'all don't know that don't shit phase me
The Nets could go, 0 for 82 and I look at you like "This shit gravy"
Ball so hard - this shit weird, we ain't even 'posed to be here
Ball so hard - since we here, it's only right that we be fair
Psycho, I'm liable to go Michael, take your pick
Jackson, Tyson, Jordan, Game 6
Ball so hard - got a broke clock, Roleys that don't tick-tock
Audemars that's losin time, hidden behind all these big rocks
B-Ball so hard - I'm shocked too, I'm supposed to be locked up too
You escaped what I escaped, you'd be in Paris gettin fucked up too
B-Ball so hard - let's get faded, Le Meurice for like six days
Gold bottles, scold models, spillin Ace on my sick J's
B-Ball so hard - bitch behave, just might let you meet 'Ye
Chi-Town's, D. Rose; I'm movin the Nets, to B.K.

[Jay-Z] Ball so hard muh'fuckers wanna fine me
[Kanye] That shit cra'y, that shit cra'y, that shit cra'y
[Jay-Z] B-Ball so hard muh'fuckers wanna fine me
[Kanye] That shit cra'y, that shit cra'y, that shit cra'y

[Kanye West] + (Jay-Z)
She said, "'Ye, can we get married at the mall?"
I said, "Look, you need to crawl 'fore you ball"
Come and meet me in the bathroom stall
And show me why you deserve to have it all
(Ball so hard) That's shit cra'y {that shit cra'y} ain't it Jay?
(Ball-ball so hard) What she order? {What she order?} Fish filet
(Ball-ball so hard) Yo' whip's so cold {whip's so cold} this old thang
(Ball so hard) Act like you'll ever be around motherfuckers like this again
Bougie girl, grab my hand, fuck that bitch she don't wanna dance
Excuse my French but I'm in France, hehe, I'm just sayin
Prince William's ain't do it right, if you ask me
Cause I was him I woulda - married Kate and Ashley
What's Gucci my nigga? What's Louie my killa?
What's drugs my dealer? What's that jacket, Margiela?
Doctors say I'm the illest, cause I'm sufferin from realness
Got my niggaz in Paris, and they goin gorillas
Huh~!

[Interlude: sample from "Blades of Glory"]
"I don't even know what that means!"
  "No one knows what it means, but it's provocative."
"No it's not, it's gross!"
  "It gets the people GOING."

[Jay-Z]
Ball so hard muh'fuckers wanna fine me...

You are now watchin the throne
Don't let me get in my zone {*3X*}

Actin like the summer ain't mine
(I got that hot bitch in my home)
You know how many hot bitches I own?
Don't let me get in my zone {*4X*}
The stars is in the building
They hands is to the ceiling

How you know? I got that feelin
You are now watchin the throne

[Jay-Z + Kanye]
