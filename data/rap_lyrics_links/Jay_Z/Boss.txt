[Intro: Beyonce]
Mmm, mmm

[Chorus: Beyonce]
Ain't nothin to it, real one
Ain't nothin to it, boss
Ain't nothin to it (nothin to it) real one
Ain't nothin to it (there's nothing) boss

[Beyonce]
Heh, I paid the cost
Who gon' take it off? (take it off)
I record then I ball (then I ball!)
I ignored a lot of calls (click, click)
You ain't talkin 'bout nothin, I ain't got no time
Got that dinero on my mind
Ohhh, I got real problems just like you (bitch!)
Tell that bitch, "I don't like you" (I don't fuck with you!)

[Chorus: Beyonce]
Ain't nothin to it, real one
Ain't nothin to it (nothin to it) boss
Ain't nothin to it (nothin to it) real one
Ain't nothin to it (nothin to it) I boss
Ohhhh, real one
Uh, I'm a boss
Oh, oh oh oh ohhh
Oh yeah

[JAY-Z] + (Beyonce)
Let me get 'em B, yeah
Hundred million crib, three million watch, all facts
No cap, false nigga, you not a boss; you got a boss
Niggaz gettin jerked, that shit hurts, I take it personally
Niggaz rather work for the man than to work with me
Just so they could pretend they on my level, that shit is irkin to me
Pride always goeth before the fall, almost certainly
It's disturbin what I gross (what I gross!)
Survey says you not even close (not even close)
Everybody's bosses 'til it's time to pay for the office
'Til them invoices separate the men, from the boys
Over here we measure success by how many people successful next to you
Here we say you broke if everybody is broke except for you
Boss!

[Chorus: Beyonce]
Ain't nothin to it, real one (real one)
Ain't nothin to it (nothin to it) boss (boss, boss, boss)
Ain't nothin to it (nothin to it) real one (real one)
Ain't nothin to it (nothin to it) I boss
Ohhhh, real one
Uh, I'm a boss
Oh, oh oh oh ohhh
Oh yeah

[Beyonce]
Ain't nothin to it, I boss so I bought my momma a whip
My great-great-grandchildren already rich
That's a lot of brown chil'ren on your Forbes list
Probably lookin around my compound on my fortress (boss boss boss boss)
Ohhh, I be ridin 'round with my seat reclining
Droppin my daughter off at school every morning
We slammin car doors
I be true ballin on these bum whores
You ain't talkin 'bout nothin
I ain't got no time, boss
Chill, tell them paps they gotta relax (you tried it)
Toes in the sand, momma gettin fat (snacks)

[Chorus: Beyonce]
Ain't nothin to it (nothin to it) real one (real one)
Ain't nothin to it (nothin to it) boss (boss)
Ain't nothin to it (nothin to it) real one (real one)
Ain't nothin to it, I boss
Ooh ohhh, real one
Ohhhhh, I'm a boss
Oh oh oh oh ohhh
Oh yeah

[Outro: Beyonce] + (Blue Ivy)
Ooooh, ohhh I'm a boss
(Shout out to Rumi and Sir, love, Blue)
