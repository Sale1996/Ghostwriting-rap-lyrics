[Intro: Sample of "Four Women" by Nina Simone]
Skin is, skin, is....
Skin black, my skin is black
My, black, my skin is yellow

[Chorus: Jay-Z]
Light nigga, dark nigga, faux nigga, real nigga
Rich nigga, poor nigga, house nigga, field nigga
Still nigga.....still nigga
I like that second one.....
Light nigga, dark nigga, faux nigga, real nigga
Rich nigga, poor nigga, house nigga, field nigga
Still nigga.....still nigga

[Verse One: Jay-Z
O.J. like...I'm not black,I'm O.J.!!!Â…...Okay!
House nigga, don't fuck with me
I'm a field nigga, with shined cutlery
Gold-plated quarters, where the butlers be
I'm a play the corners, where the hustlers be
I told 'em, please don't die over the neighborhood, that your mama rentin'
Take your drug money and buy the neighborhood, that's how you rinse it
Uh! I bought every V12 engine
Wish I could take it back to the beginnin'

[Interlude: Jay-Z
I could've bought a place in Dumbo before it was Dumbo...for like 2 million
That same building today is worth 25 million, and guess how I'm feelin'? 
Dumbo! 
 
[Chorus: Jay-Z]
Light nigga, dark nigga, faux nigga, real nigga
Rich nigga, poor nigga, house nigga, field nigga
Still nigga.....still nigga
Light nigga, dark nigga, faux nigga, real nigga
Rich nigga, poor nigga, house nigga, field nigga
Still nigga.....still nigga

[Interlude: Jay-Z]
You wanna know what's more important than throwin' away money at a strip club? Credit
You ever wonder why Jewish people own all the property in America? This how they did it

[Verse Two: Jay-Z]
Financial freedom my only hope
Fuck livin' rich and dyin' broke
I bought some artwork for one million
Two years later that shit worth  two million
Few years later that shit worth eight million
I can't wait to give this shit to my children
Y'all think it's bougie I'm like, it's fine
But I'm tryin' to give you a million dollars worth of game for $9.99
I turned that two to a fo', fo' to a eight 
I turned my life into a nice first week release date
Ummm! Y'all out here still takin' advances huh?
Me and my niggas takin' real chances uh!
Y'all on the 'Gram holdin' money to your ear
There's a disconnect we don't call that money over here 
Yeah!
 
[Chorus: Jay-Z]
Light nigga, dark nigga, faux nigga, real nigga
Rich nigga, poor nigga, house nigga, field nigga
Still nigga.....still nigga
Light nigga, dark nigga, faux nigga, real nigga
Rich nigga, poor nigga, house nigga, field nigga
Still nigga.....still nigga
