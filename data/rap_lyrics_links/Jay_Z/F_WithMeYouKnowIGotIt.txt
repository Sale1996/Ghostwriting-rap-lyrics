[Intro: sample of Pimp C talking]
Little over a year ago I was in bondage
And now I'm back out here reapin the blessings
and gettin the benefits that go along with it
Everything that's out here for kings like us
The reason why we like this-this jewelry and this diamonds and stuff
They don't understand, is because we really from Africa
and that's where all this stuff come from
and we originated from kings, youknow'msayin?
So, don't look down on the youngsters cause they wanna have shiny things
It's in our genes, know'msayin?
We just don't all know our history so...

[Chorus 2X: Rick Ross]
Fuck with me, you know I got it
Fuck with me, you know I got it
Sexy bitch, I hope she 'bout it
Come fuck with me, you know I got it

[Rick Ross]
I just landed in Europe, nigga
Shoppin bags, I'm a tourist, nigga
Money talk I speak fluent, nigga
Reeboks on, I "just do it," nigga
Look at me, I'm pure, nigga
I bet the hoes on my tour, nigga
I don't bop, I do the money dance
My bitch whip cost a hundred grand
Red 'vert, you see me slide
Sexy bitch, I hope she 'bout it
Sexy bitch, I know she 'bout it!
Fuck with me, you know I got it

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z]
Hov just landed in Rome, nigga
All hail, Caesar's home, niggaz
Chin don, ciao bella
Come money dance with the +Good+ +Fellas+
Hov keep gettin that dinero/De Niro, got it?
Even if a nigga gotta rob it/Robert, get it?
Black Jack in a +Casino+, a nigga got unlimited credit, uh
A nigga got a lot of vendettas, uh, but we the black mob, we gon' set it, uh
Peel off in a Lamborghini Countach, 200 in the dash we gonna rev it - skerrt!
Lucky Luciano is what that call me, Paisano
A hundred keys/ki's at the piano, plays across the Verrazano
El Pa-drino, in the villa in Venice sippin vino
Not bad for a Mulignano, y'all know, like we know
I got it~!

Fuck with me, you know I got it
Fuck with me, you know I got it
Bad bitch, I hope she 'bout it
Fuck with me, you know I got it
Fuck with me, you know I got it
Fuck with me, you know I got it
Bad bitch, I hope she 'bout it
Bad bitch, I know she 'bout it!
