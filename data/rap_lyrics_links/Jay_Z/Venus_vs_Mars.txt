[Jay-Z]
If Hov's a Blackberry Bold, then shorty is a Sidekick
She used to have a man, I used to have a side chick
Shorty got wind, I had to blow the chick off
We got rid of him, they both took the shit hard
Shorty played the piano, me I play with white keys
Shorty from the South  oh, I think she like me
Shorty like 'Pac; me? Big Poppa
She screamin "Hit 'Em Up", I'm screamin "Who Shot Ya?"
I'm on that red wine, shorty like white
Same shit different toilet, we both gettin nice
Me I'm from the Apple which means I'm a Mac
She's a PC, she lives in my lap

[Chorus: Jay-Z] + (Beyoncé)
Shorty get it in (but daddy go hard)
Shorty get it in (da-d-daddy go hard)
Shorty get it in (but daddy go hard)
Shorty get it in (da-d-daddy go hard)
Shorty get it in (but daddy go hard)
Shorty get it in (da-d-daddy go hard)
Shorty get it in (but daddy go hard)
Shorty get it in, Venus vs. Mars

[Jay-Z]
Whether black or white, we both like Mike
We both like Jordans, we both feels Nikes
I finish my breakfast, shorty's out to lunch
Yeah we both eatin, it's better than brunch
Shorty like Pepsi, me I'm the Coke man
Body like a Coke bottle, I crush it like a Coke can
Started at the +window+, end up at the +wall+
The Ying to my Yang, I +skeet skeet+ off
Then it's salt-n-pepper back, shorty like the front
The Bonnie to my Clyde, both ridin shotgun
Both covered in gold, like C-3PO
James and Florida Evans  let the +Good Times+ roll (yeah)

[Chorus]

[Jay-Z]
Thought shorty was the truth  found out she was a cheater
We were supposed to "Takeover"  I caught her bumpin "Ether"
I thought shorty like Mike, found out she like Prince
Thought she was Adrian, it's been +Rocky+ ever since
My dollars was down, she left me for some euros
Took my whole flavor, I call her Coke Zero
We were co-MVP's, like Kobe and Shaq
Left me for the +Heat+, we were winnin back-to-back
Said I party too much, shorty got fed up
Shorty got Britney, shaved her whole head up
We used to make out, kissin each other's face off
Went for the Ponzi scheme - damn shorty just made off

[Chorus]
