[Intro: Frank Ocean]
Ready for it
I'm ready for it
Yeah, ahh

[Jay-Z]
Eastside nigga with the feets high
Nigga with that Lisa, uh
Talkin' about that Lisa nigga with that Westside nigga
With that Eastside (that dance, uhh)

Your eyes speak the truth when everything else lies
May pretend that we kin but the vibes don't fly
Bruh, I survived readin' guys like you
I'm surprised y'all think you can disguise y'all truths
I seen eyes wide as they're about to shoot
You can be a hairpin off or you can trigger your roots
I wave to these haters, don't give me dap
You know the world can see just how phony you act
Bruh, y'all body language is all remedial
How could you see the difference between you and I?
My crash course was much tougher
'Round friends who kill they friends then hug their friends' mothers
and show up at the funeral complete with blank stares
Invisible ink, I had to read things that wasn't there
Memories may sneak down my cheek
But I could see a side-eye in my sleep
Uhh, uhh

[Chorus: Frank Ocean]
Ready for it, deep breath fill up the void
Eyes open them up, check off the coins
Still stingin' from tears, they try to see you
I'm ready for Earth, ready for real
Solipsistic, admit it, I see you there
So it seems, so you seem
I can't tell if you're image or are just the flare
In my dreams, in my dreams

[Jay-Z]
Uhh, I sat down with Prince eye-to-eye
He told me his wishes before he died
Now Londell McMillan, he must be color blind
They only see green from them purple eyes
They eyes hide, they eyes high
My eyes wide shut to all the lies
These industry niggas, they always been fishy
But ain't no Biggie, no lazy eye, huh
This guy had "slave" on his face
You think he wanted the masters with his masters?
You greedy bastards sold tickets to walk through his house
I'm surprised you ain't auction off the casket
Don't big bro me, don't big homie
I've seen pure admiration become rivals
I've been to Paris at least two times
I've seen the Eiffel, I've seen a eyeful

[Chorus]

[Frank Ocean]
Hopin' I could touch what I feel (hopin', what)
I've been ready for this for real
Hopin' I could touch what I feel (hopin', what)
I've been ready for this for real

[Interlude]
"Look, you've done enough
 Have you no sense of decency, sir?
 At long last, have you left, no sense of decency?"

[Outro: Jay-Z]
Eastside nigga with the feets high
Nigga with that Lisa, uh
Talkin' about that Lisa nigga with that Westside nigga
With that Eastside, uhh
