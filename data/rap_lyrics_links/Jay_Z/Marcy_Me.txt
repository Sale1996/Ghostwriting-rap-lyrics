[Intro: Jay-Z]
Yeah! Live from Bedford-Stuyvesant the livest one 
Representin' B.K. to the fullest
Bastards duckin' when Hov be buckin'
Chickenheads be cluckin'

[Verse One: Jay-Z]
Uh! Back when ratchet was a ratchet and a vixen was a vixen
And Jam Master Jay was alive, I-I-I was mixin'
Cookin' coke in the kitchen back when +Rodman+ was a +Piston+
+Mike+ was losin' to +Isiah+ but he soon would get his sixth one
Gave birth to my verbal imagination assume a virtue if you have not
Or better yet here's a verse from +Hamlet+
Lord, we know who we are yet we know not what we may be
So, maybe I'm the one or maybe I'm crazy
I'm from, +Marcy+ Houses where the boys die by the thousand
Back when Pam was on +Martin+ Yeah that's where it all started
When Denzel was blottin' carpet, I'll pack a 
Nine millimeter when Slick Rick made +Mona Lisa+
When Lisa Bonet was Beyoncé of her day I had divas y'all
Think I just popped up in this bitch like a fetus? Nah
Pregnant pause, give you some second thoughts
There's room on the bandwagon don't abort
Marcy me
 
[Verse Two: Jay-Z]
Marcy me, streets is my artery
The vein of my existence I'm the Gotham City heartbeat
I started in lobbies, now parley with Saudis
I'm an, Sufi to goofies, I could probably speak Farsi
That's poetry reek of coca leaf in my past
Came through the bushes smellin' like roses I need a trophy just for that
Old Brooklyn, not this new shit, shift feel like a spoof
Fat laces in your shoe I'm talkin' bustin' off the roof
Hold a Uzi vertical, let the thing smoke
Y'all flirtin' with death I be winkin' through the scope
Shout out to all the murderers turned murals
Plural! Fuck the Federal Bureau!
Shoutout to Nostrand Ave., Flushing Ave., Myrtle
All the County of Kings may your ground stay fertile
Shoutout to +Big Poppa+ +Daddy Kane+ heroes
Thus concludin' my concerto,  Marcy me

[Outro: The-Dream]
Must be in the air! Ohhhhh!
Can't walk away I know (I know)
Just the way I'm raised I know (I Know I know!)
Oh Marcy, Marcy me
Just the way I am, always gonna be
I ain't gonna change, no
Marcy, Marcy me, just the way I am
Ain't no changing no! Ain't no changing no! 
No! Whoaaaaa!!!
You couldn't change me if you wanted to!
You couldn't change me if you wanted to!
I'm a take this with me to the moon!
