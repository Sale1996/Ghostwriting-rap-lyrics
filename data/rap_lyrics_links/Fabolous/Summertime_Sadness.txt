[Intro: sample of Lana Del Rey's "Summertime Sadness"]
"Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby you're the best"

[Fabolous]
Nothing more stressful than buryin' your best bull 
Feelin' empty make you keep that Smith & Wes' full 
I realized that it's more snakes and less wolves
So me and my trey pound like KD and Westbrook 
We just tryna get up out that cesspool 
We just tryna eat, not up in no mess hall 
My old head that used to rob dropped the best jewels 
He said "Your failure's gonna teach you to be successful" 
I'm rocking carrots/karats but I never ate my vegetables 
I'm playin' festivals, I used to play the vestibules 
Stuntin' every day, my schedule was flexible 
VIP sectionals, grabbin' on my testicles 
Got an extra full clip for that extra bullshit
Nigga you gotta give us some answers, you're doin' questionable shit 
Your old lady showed me +Good Times+ on some Esther Rolle shit 
We live in a cold world, I'm on my eskimo shit
It's sad 

[Chorus: sample of Lana Del Rey's "Summertime Sadness"]
"Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
Baby you're the best
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
S-s-summertime, summertime sadness
Got that summertime, summertime sadness, ohh"

[Dave East]
I was born in the summer 
Malik died in the summer 
It get live in the summer...

Head to Brooklyn, I'm knockin' this Bobby Shmurda in my G-Stars
Free my GS9 niggas, throw Rowdy on and breeze off 
Since a rookie shootin' like Ray Allen in that 3-4
when he was a Milwaukee Buck, not whisperin', I'm talkin' up
Look, I can't be worried about ISIS, my life is triflin'
Affordin' dollar slices, just prayin' they don't indight us 
Keepin' both my fists raised up, I'm like the fightin' Irish
Had molly sales at Notre Dame when ain't nobody know my name 
Remember givin' caine out, remember all the misses givin' brain out 
Remember when Fab was spellin' his name out 
Before I bought the foreigns, took the train route 
When Cam had that pink Range out, it was Reggie, wasn't no paint out
Vegas nights, sky dweller Rollie look like a Vegas light 
Was tryna pitch an eighth of white just to go eat some steak and rice 
I know you hate this life, jeweler actin' nervous tryna break the ice
{"Nothing scares me anymore"}
I love Red Bottoms but really hate the spikes
It's sad

[Chorus]

[Outro: sample of Lana Del Rey's "Summertime Sadness"]
"Ohh-oh oh-ohh...
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby you're the best
I got my red dress on tonight
Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight
Got my hair up real big beauty queen style..."
