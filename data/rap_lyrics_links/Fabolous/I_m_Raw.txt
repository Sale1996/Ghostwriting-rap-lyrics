Bitch I'm raw
So hearing that any nigga out cook me
Is suspect as R. kelly with girl scout cookies
When you talking to a pro watch ya mouth rookie
Go in ya shIt have ya teeth playin mouth hookie
Nice, you nIggas must of heard me wrong
I blame them horses when I turn that Porche turby on (vrrrrm)
My engine gettin his Kentucky derby on
Seats is brunette... paint is dirty blonde
Speaking of dirty blonde... say hi to curvy don... Fergie john
With the body movement of a turbion
I just watch ha it's been a hectic year... so I sit and get fried
Call the weed electric chair
But ya'll on death row... one request left
U looking for ya girl oh she just left
Her and my dIck just became BFFs
Then I threw her out like Jazzy J.E.F.F
I'm raw dawg ya'll safe sex
You dIcks belong in latex not tape decks
You can't see me
Neither can the flunkies under you
My shIt bananas like a monkey number 2
I'm bigger than that
More like guerrillai though
Nick name funeral got that from ths killer flow
Err things still a go my pockets be extra fat
Big money on deck like A Rods next to bat
Shit, somebody contact the tabloids
I'm a big deal like a contract from bad boy
Yeahh... it's all good baby baaaby
My swag plays a big part so it's all gravy
We hit the club like Nino in the C.M.B
Pretty mixed b-tch I just call ha P.M.B
Watch ya step baby gettin out that G.M.C
You bust yo ass girl we both gon be on T.M.Z
Don't be shy let them cameras expose you
The worst that can happen is I Amber Rose you
People running up like damn I knows you
Hey ain't you? yeah I am that b-tch
6 feet deep nigga yeah I am that ditch
Throw it in the bag in a recession, I am that rich
I'm under close watch nIggas got binoculars
I ain't what's poppin bItch I'm what's popular
If I'm the one to go at nIggas what's stopping ya
I call my gun Nadia and I be finger poppin ha
Keep that bitch comming like blakka blakka
Go to ya head like a shot of vodka
Rock a sick fit call a doctor potnah
You think I had a Gucci deal, Waka Flocka
yeahh I am tooo fucking raw...
Yeah you heard me I am too fucking raw
