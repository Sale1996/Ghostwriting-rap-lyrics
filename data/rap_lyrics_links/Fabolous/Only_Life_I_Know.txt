[Intro: Troy Ave]
Powder

[Chorus: Troy Ave]
She said I wanna hold you down but we ain't never 'gon be right (Never 'gon be right)
'Cause you too caught up in the street life (Caught up in the street life)
But that's the only life I know oh oh oh oh!
She said them niggas that's around you they ain't never 'gon be right (Never 'gon be right)
'Cause everybody wanna be Mike (Everybody wanna be Mike)
Instead of focusin on they own, own, own, own dough
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Powder!
But this the only life I know oh oh oh oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Powder!
But this the only life I know oh oh oh oh!

[Verse One: Fabolous]
They say a woman cancel dates 'cause she has to
And a man cancel dates 'cause he has two
Well I got two dates, one with destiny
I need more baby don't think any less of me
Tryin to juggle, slowly became a struggle
Sometime I wanna hug the block sometime I wanna hug you
Sometime it's 'bout the check, sometime it's 'bout checkin that
Dinero said you gotta leave in thirty seconds flat (Word!)
When the heat's comin even if you meet someone
Leave it in the rear view don't look back keep runnin
Left her in the passenger, with the jeep runnin
Hazard lights blinkin and the beat bumpin
Ear to the streets I hear the sweeps comin
Ear to yo' chest so I hear a beat from it
She fell in love with a street nigga
Tattoo my name on her petite figure

[Chorus: Troy Ave]
She said I wanna hold you down but we ain't never 'gon be right (Never 'gon be right)
'Cause you too caught up in the street life (Caught up in the street life)
But that's the only life I know oh oh oh oh!
She said them niggas that's around you they ain't never 'gon be right (Never 'gon be right)
'Cause everybody wanna be Mike (Everybody wanna be Mike)
Instead of focusin on they own, own, own, own dough
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Powder!
But this the only life I know oh oh oh oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Powder!
But this the only life I know oh oh oh oh!

[Verse Two: Fabolous]
There's always money to be made that you can't deny
I always made mine never one who can't decide
I'm only human so if I don't eat I can't survive
And mama said your not a man if you can't provide
The son must know a shortcut it beats me whole
I work so hard to get here now it keep me gone
By the time I get in what she made to eat be old
When I slide in bed she complain my feet be cold
'Caught up in the street life just like my bitch said
I love the game I love the hustle just like Mitch said
Yeah I could leave the game, but is they still 'gon love me?!
And when that new nigga come, they 'gon stop thinkin of me
Shorty watch the hustler movie she can never get
How they make so much money, but they never quit
I tell her quit for what that's the only life they know
The streets a dirty hoe, niggas try to wife it though

[Chorus: Troy Ave]
She said I wanna hold you down but we ain't never 'gon be right (Never 'gon be right)
'Cause you too caught up in the street life (Caught up in the street life)
But that's the only life I know oh oh oh oh!
She said them niggas that's around you they ain't never 'gon be right (Never 'gon be right)
'Cause everybody wanna be Mike (Everybody wanna be Mike)
Instead of focusin on they own, own, own, own dough
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Powder!
But this the only life I know oh oh oh oh!
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Powder!
But this the only life I know oh oh oh oh!
