[Fabolous]
You know them hoes don't want to see you happy baby
Yeah...

Make sure you tell em every detail 
Make sure you see see/CC 'em on that email 
Talk how that Mercedes gettin' detailed 
Mention that new C.C. back at retail 
Them hoes be jeal', never wish me well 
Told my lady that I'm leggin' bitches like I'm Miguel 
Big mouth bitch we just call her Gmail
You know everybody had her Gmail 
My nigga Craig said "Deebo, that's a female" 
I say she fuckin like a nigga, that's a she-male 
Every crew have a +Shady+ one just like D-12 
All she ride is dick, you ridin' that V12 
In that S6, talkin' on a 6S 
Not no gossip, just makin' moves at success 
These bitches flexin' on a baller alert
Guess they don't know, that's a bitch who need a baller allure (oh you ain't know)
Gossip just a broke people sport (oh you ain't know) 
Deep pockets, even deeper thoughts (oh you ain't know)
Snakes in the grass, keep it short (oh you ain't know)
Free Wi-Fi and it's cheap to talk, so, go 

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Go tell your friends about it (about it)
Go tell your friends about it (about it)
Go tell 'em what you know
What you seen, how I roll, how I be on the low (whoooa ohh-whoa)
Go tell your friends about it (about it)
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair, singin' 'bout poppin' pills
Fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill

[Fabolous]
She don't want the key to your heart, she want the key to your whip 
If she had the key to your heart, she'll prolly key up your whip
I'm tellin' her, egos trip but the humble doesn't stumble baby
You feelin' yo'self, I'm the one that numb you baby
I seen it come together and I seen it crumble baby 
Let them keep score, we just do our numbers baby
Everybody talkin', I feel like a trendin' topic
#Ibetyourmouthbiggerthanyourpocket 
I got you and your bag, new CÃ©line 
Got you Young Fly, +FawwwkUMean+
Let them groupies chat in the group chat
Niggas tryna shoot, they shot but don't know where the hoops at 
Bitch you know I'm ballin', if you smart, you would recruit that
Niggas catchin' plagues, ask me where the alley-oops at
Man you know this game is vicious, all they want is fame and riches 
Wifin' up the lamest bitches and they tellin' same as snitches
So...

[Chorus]

[Interlude: woman] 
Listen, me and my bitches are like sisters
So of course, we give our opinion on everything, okay cool, granted
I'm never the type of female that'll call my bitches haters
if they give they opinion on my relationship if my relationship is fucked up
But bitch, if I tell you I'm happy with my relationship
If I tell you I'm happy with my nigga, just be happy that I'm happy
Bitch I ain't gotta lie to you, I'm grown
And they always wanna bring up what ya nigga did in the past
Okay cool, you was a hoe in past, bitch I still got you 

[The Weeknd]
My cousin said I made it big and it's unusual
She tried to take a selfie at my grandma's funeral 
Used to roam on Queen now I sing Queen street anthems 
Used to hate attention now I pull up in that wagon
And I was broken, I was broken, I was so broke
I used to roam around the town when I was homeless
Me and Lamar would rob a nigga for his Jordans
And flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix 
Now we get faded when we want girl, we got choices
Lay them on the fuckin' table, we got choices
And if they wanna fuck my niggas, they got choices
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless 
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless

[Chorus]
