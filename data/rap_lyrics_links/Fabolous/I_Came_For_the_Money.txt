[Intro]
I heard this nigga be right here man
Up in some bitch crib up here man on third floor
{"Gangsta..."} Yeah he come out this building
{"Gangsta..."} I'ma warm his ass up
So this nigga playin with the money man, the fuck?
This nigga been duckin me all fuckin week man
{"Gangsta Grizzill!"}

[Fabolous: repeat 2X]
I'm waitin on my green like I'm sittin at a red light
Yeah the big nigga better have my bread right
Heard if the head right, nigga there e'ry night
Saw him outside in the ride, no headlights

[Fabolous]
(Turn the engine down man) Got the semi 9 with the red light
He gon' give me mine, or he dead aight?
It's a dead night and nobody on the block
(There's nobody out here and shit man)
In the morning John Doe body on the block
(Leave these nigga right here)
I went crazy on the day I got the fuckin call
This nigga and his bitch shoppin in the fuckin mall
(WHAT~?! The fuck he doin in that, fuckin mall?)
I'm blowin up his phone, pussy nigga duckin calls
(This nigga owe me)
Spendin my money on his slut who suckin balls
(I'm killin this nigga man!)
Heard the nigga club poppin bottle after bottle
Whatever car he in, that's what Rollo have to follow
Can't wait to walk up, pop him hollow after hollow
Pass me that shit son, now here this nigga go

[Chorus: repeat 8X]
I came for the money - I ain't here to play wit y'all

[Fabolous]
I caught him walkin out the building slow, quickly I draw the toast
Shoulda saw his face, looked like he saw a ghost
He kept backin up, I'm tryin to draw him close
He's sayin "Chill! I know what I got for you Los'"
"Give me a little time, a nigga got jammed in jail"
"You know my fam Jamel, look like Sam Casell"
"Got an op with like 900 grams a scale"
"On 7-5 North, Alabama sale"
I don't know the nigga, don't give a damn as well
You no +Negotiator+ and I ain't Samuel
I squeeze two then the chamber got jammed with shells (fuck!)
And they say life is a gamble well
(Fuck this shit I'ma kill this nigga man)
Guess today was his lucky day
He gotta move now, I know where the fuck he stay
Taste his little chicken fried the Kentucky way
Bet if I flash that, she know where the stash at

[Outro]
That bitch know where that money at man {"Gangsta..."}
That's what we gon' do, we gon' lay on this bitch
This nigga gon' come through here {"Gangsta..."}
That's it man, this nigga playin with the money
{"Gangsta Grizzill!"}
