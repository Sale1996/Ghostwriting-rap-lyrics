I am logged on to FuckNiggas.com
And I am everything these fuck niggas not Dram'
Must be some confusion you niggas are not me
I am an illusion really what you can not see
So picture me like a paparazzi 
H dot N dot I dot C
We don't play when we roll no Yahtzee
And I hate you niggas no Nazi
But this the Holocaust rap genocide
Ike Turner take that bitch slaps in the ride
My shawty tellin' me "Kill the competition boo"
And I be tellin' her "There is no competition to"
NICE There Is No Competition 2
It's good to wake up look in the mirror
And the only competition's you
And even that nigga ain't seein' me
My reflection have a hard time being me
So the tryin' to do me shit it's time to dead it
I'm what you don't do even if Simon said it
I kill em with this shine give these black diamonds credit
And my watch is sick but I have no time for medics
Black ice in the Audemars this is custom order brah
First I call a jeweler up then I call the coroner
My car is a foriegner my bitch is from Florida
I killed the pussy lastnight so now her man is mourning her
Good morning sir I good night niggas
Y'all on Death Row I Suge Knight niggas
Time to depart I book flights nigga
Whassup son what it look like nigga
Black dress black suits black shades black boots
Black trucks black coupes guns blow black flutes
Black card black jewels black party bag
Black Friday throw it in a body bag
Black Barbie thats what I call my black broad
African plug thats what I call a black cord
Get your sharps get your flats thats the black keys
Gettin slicker get your hoes and your black tees
Black limos black town cars black hearses
Black register books signed in black cursive
Black tears white tissues out of black purses
Thats procedure when I'm sendin' back verses
