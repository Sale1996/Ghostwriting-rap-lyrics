[Lil' Mo]
You are now tuned in to WFAB radio

[Fabolous]
Yo. Baby Girl where you at?

[Lil' Mo]
Right here, Right here, Right here baby, uh, here's another one

[Fabolous]
You need to holla at somebody real, such as myself
Won't nobody do as much as myself
And it's so real, I hop out and get the Duchess myself
For a pretty girl such as yourself
Cuz I'm a busy man and don't see too much for myself
and sometimes it be hard to get in touch with myself
But I, make the time when I have to
Learn to take my time and be careful when dealin'
With women there's some who be wheelin' and schemin'
And dive in to relationships cuz I got a million to swim in
They'll throw it to you faster than Schilling and Clemens
But feelings ain't the only thing that you can catch now
Some do lawyers that you hopin' ?they fed styles?
Others pass diseases that you could catch now
But in my minutes alone I think about this crazy world
And don't wanna live in it alone cuz

[Chorus: Lil' Mo]
I'll give you all my love and you can always trust
my loyalty, honesty and security
I'll never leave can't none of these other chicks
(fuck) with me so holla at somebody real
Cause I'm so real

[Fabolous]
I'm searchin' for real love like J. Blige in '92
But I pray I would find you
They say weather the storm and leave the gray skies behind you
The fake may try to blind you
That's why I stay fly like I do
And no I can't trust everybody that I say "Hi" and "Bye" to
First I need a girl that may die as my boo
Then I may try the "I Do's", but I refuse
to be tricked or used by a chick
who get amusement and kicks out abusing my dick
When it's real I'm all in it
But I don't want the scars of love that you get when you fall in it
Before it didn't matter who
Now I look for some with a little attitude
I could chill to chatter to, good looking but witty and compatible
Long hair with a fatty too, and that'll do

[Chorus]

[Hook: Lil' Mo]
No I'm not trying to pressure you
But my loves too incredible, far too great, (right in front of your face)
And I'll give you something you can feel
To let you know that I really need somebody real

[Fabolous]
I need to holla at somebody real, could that be you
The feelings that I feel, could that be true
Most cats lay where the hood rats beat boo
But I'm the kinda cat that strays away
That's till somebody real sways my way
Then I might spend some days away, on an Asia Bay
Eatin' food made the Cajun way, and sippin' a little sake
Boilin' a little broccoli
But this world is full of floozies that bullshit usually
I pull them choosy
Cuz on this joint, and at this point
I know I have to holla at somebody real, for real

[Chorus] - repeat to fade
