Its no love for the other side fuck those tricks
pop a glove on the side and buck them pricks

I been one of them boys since way back when
this was way before a nigga brought weight packs in
so if I spray mac 10's 
bet you niggaz lay back like you in the Maybach Benz
yea I make crack grands
but ain't a damn thing funny
I keep a pocket full to do the damn thing money
I keep it comin wit bottles of champagne honey
so keep it bouncin till you pull a hamstring honey

I got them tricks standin like dey gotta problem wit me 
I got them boys slangin rocks in the lobby for me
I'm rich bitch, ballin just a hobby for me
 
[Chorus]
Gotta Pocket full of money
