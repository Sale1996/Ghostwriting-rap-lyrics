[Intro: Latif]
Here on the Eastside, we be paper touchin
It all started out in Brooklyn
Yeah, but the kid kept it movin
Uhh, I came along way from hustlin
Now it's worldwide paper touchin {"Gangsta Grillz"}
Here on the Eastside, we be paper touchin
("You know the cheese to the sky all day e'ry day")
Here on the Westside, we be paper touchin
{"Gangsta..."}

[Red Cafe]
Uh, the Big Wills sittin on big wheels
Brooklyn's back, imagine how Big feel
(What else?!) Yeah I am a big deal
Tell 'em keep the change, when I break big bills
Talk is cheap, everyone could afford it
This for the hustlers, everyone should applaud it (uhh)
Get'cha camera phone, everyone should record it (ahh)
I'm the pizza man, I delivers the orders (woo)
Arm &, Ham-in-mer-ham-and-the-grits
Homey I'll cut your wrist off, put your hands on my grits
See I'll be the convict, I am fully committed
Took my shoes off and laughed, they couldn't fit it
(What else?!) If I don't do nuttin I'm a ball
Fall through your city, shut down the mall
(That all~?!) I'm Tupac with it, I got the "Juice"
Soldier, but only the gangsters I salute

[Chorus: Latif]
It all started out in Brooklyn
Yeah, but the kid kept it movin
Uhh, I came along way from hustlin
Now it's worldwide paper touchin
Here on the Eastside, we be paper touchin
Here on the Westside, we be paper touchin

[Red Cafe]
She's sick of that song, how it's so long
since she met a G like me
First it was Kane, then it was Big, then it was Jay
And she love the homey F-A-B, now meet me
(It's R) Flow-riffic, white flower I whip it
Spin it round and round, stand on my pivot (voila)
Keep that white girl, Christina Aguilera
I seen the king soon as I got a mirror
(What else?!) Gettin fresh and lettuce be my fetish
Retired with the chip like Je-rome Bettis
I wonder, if I stacked Bread like Wonder
Would my Woman's first name be Wonder?
When it come to me they are Stevie Wonder
They can't see I, I am B.I.G.'s student
Make 'em holla it's movin
Make 'em light up and get to boozin

[Chorus]

[Outro: Red Cafe] + (Latif)
Hey zukon you know I gotta diddy bop to this one
(Paper touchin)
Why not? {"My nigga Red Cafe!"}
(Paper touchin)
