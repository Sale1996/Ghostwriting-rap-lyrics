[Intro: Josk K]
You used to, yeah...

[Chorus: Josh K]
You used to call me on my trap phone
Late night when you need those drugs
Call me on my trap phone
Late night when you need those drugs
Cause I know when that trapline bling
That can only mean one thing
Cause I know when that trapline bling
That can only mean one thing 

[Josh K]
Ever since I left the city, you
You got a new connect now
Say you got that work and you got pounds now
I see you +Charged Up+ cause you the plug now 
Ever since I left the city, you
Started gettin' money, now you got hoes
Spendin' hella bands at the new store
Hangin' with some lames I've never seen before

[Chorus]

[Fabolous]
Trapline bling
Mean one thing

When the pay callin', that's bae callin', I played the field now I'm play callin'
In the old days, it was Jays callin', now it's Lenny sayin "Jay's callin'"
And them some old hoe just hit this number, want the wood, tryna get this lumber 
Got me soundin' like X in Belly, "How the fuck did you get this number?!"
Know these girls love a street mogul that catch plays and eat noble
With the Balmains, knees ripped open, and the burnout, that flip open
Trap king need a trap queen, we call that trap royalty
If we lick together, we'll be rich forever, call that trap loyalty (wooo)
So stay down, I'ma hit you back, got one, tryna get two back
Whip a Benz, tryna get two back, let a real nigga sit you back
Fly you in then get flew back, got your ex tryna get you back
Grab the mic, tell that bitch move back
I would like to make a shout out to
All my hustlers out here that just love to grind
You gon' have to call me back another time
Bitch I got El Chapo on the other line
So only call me on my trap phone 
Late night when you need those drugs

[Chorus] - minus first two bar lines

[Josh K]
Can you tell me something? Why you all on my line 
Tellin' me that I'm a liar?
Thinkin' I'm out with these hoes
When I'm, really at the studio
I'm out here in these streets riskin' my freedom just to
Give you a better future
Shawty I'm out trappin'
Which means I'm, takin' risks and prosperin'

[Chorus]

[Josh K]
You used to call me on my trap phone
