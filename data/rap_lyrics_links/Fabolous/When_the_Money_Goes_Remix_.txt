[Chorus - Jay-Z]
When the money goes, will the honeys stay?
When the gray skies replace the sunny days
(Hey), hey, (hey), hey, (hey), hey, (hey), uh
When the money goes, will the honeys stay?
When the gray skies replace the sunny days
(Hey), hey, (hey), hey, (hey), hey, (hey), uh

[Verse 1 - Fabolous]
It was all good, just +A Week Ago+
Shoe box full, no sneakers though
Just moved in, it's been a week or so
Brand new coupe, so that she could go
White Bent' (white Bent'), light tint (light tint)
Ridin like "what the fuck is an indictment?"
Spend ten thou' for excitement
That's how the day goes, that's how the nights went
Louis bags, Balenciagas
The ones talked about by the fashion bloggers
You know me, I'm a Murci√©lago
In the same lime green as the Air Max joggers
But if it wasn't here, will she wanna go?
You don't wanna ask but you wanna know
Will my baby weather the storm?
Stick around 'til the weather is warm, hey

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Fabolous]
She likes shopping but never trendy
A little Gucci, maybe Fendi
Island hoppin, the west Indies
Diddy said that +It's All About The Benjies+
Ki Tao (Ki Tao), Phillipe Chow (Phillipe Chow)
Reservations, we could sleep now
Ask how much, I don't allow such (naw)
Pull a Air Max out ya reptile clutch
But who knew that the sky
 get cloudy?
I bought a Ford Range, didn't think she'd be outtie/Audi
Huh, the game's over, seized my Range Rover
Feds said somebody gave my name over
Now I'm inside, she's outside
What should you do?  How about ride
Guess nothin last forever
I thought we could watch these clouds pass together - but hey

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Fabolous]
You can't ride big, on little rims
You wanna do it B.I.G., you need a Lil' Kim
Raise her hand high, look in the man eye
I don't know 'em your honor, can't lie
Money comes (money comes), money goes (money goes)
So you need to blow it like a runny nose
On a lady who ain't turn 180
Place no one above ya, +Sweet Sadie+
Sun stop shinin, she never got shady
She could of watched 'em box you in like a Brady
But she stood up, like "what up?"
It's a cold world, zip the coat, put the hood up
That's some sick shit, that's a ill bitch
When you dead broke, she make you feel rich
See mama, you're my Rihanna
Pull a +Umbrella+ when you see drama, hey

[Chorus]
