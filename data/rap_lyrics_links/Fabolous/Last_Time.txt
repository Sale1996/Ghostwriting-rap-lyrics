[Chorus - Trey Songz]
(This is the last time), I know I'm about to drive you crazy
(Last time), but I gotta see my baby
I know I swore that I never break your heart no more
(Try to walk) but I just can't leave her alone, girl
She keep callin me, callin me
I try to leave her alone but, she keep callin me, callin me
And I gotta go

[Verse 1 - Fabolous]
Damn, here we go again
I just came back, girl don't make me go again
She said you been in the streets, you was with that ho again
Money wrapped in rubberbands, what ya sellin blow again?
How she got you holdin guns but you call that ho your friend?
You ainít 'posed to bring her home, what you do? You show her in
I was like show her in? Never that, oh no
Anybody in the streets know that that's a "no no"
So no I would never ever, ever, ever
Baby I'm a G, yeah that's right, the seventh letter
See one thing about the streets, I know where that heffa at
And I bet she always be exactly where I left her at
But you know we had a bond, no ring, no paper
And I don't hear this shit when I bring home paper
My ears to the streets (streets), what you gon' tell us? (tell us)
You keep talkin down girl, you sound like you jealous

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Fabolous]
"Hi hunnie, I'm home"
She looked at me and said "it's 520somethin in the morní
You smell like you've been drinkin, the vibe from ya is strong"
I said "baby that's cologne", she said "nigga that's PatrÛn
If you wanna keep with them bad habits, that's fine
You think I'm with it, then you out your rabbit ass mind
They say Trix/tricks are for kids, most chicks would of slid
But who ain't miss a visit through the six that you did?
I be damned if I do another six withís some kids
Who only see their daddy in them flicks on the fridge
Them niggaz that ya think are in the mix with ya shit
They the same reason Michael Vick's doin bids
I say "hold up, I met you, I was thuggin back then
And you was ridin with me holdin on a MAC-10"
"But that was back then, you ain't give a what
Now you standin here, tellin me to give a hug"

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Fabolous]
Hold on baby please
You can't leave now, no John baby please
We goní get you to a hospital, as quickly as possible
Life is full of obstacles, we goní get you through this one
You looked me in my eye (eye), when you told you was done
I played her for a fool but I guess I was the foolish one
Remember when she told me that she know how this dream ends
Late night phone call from one of my close friends
Tellin you that we are, rushin to the ER
By this time tomorrow, we were supposed to be in D.R.
Me blowin a cigar, you sippin a 'tini
I told her pack her bags=2
0and don't forget her bikini
Then just like Houdini, it all disappeared
The escape to Paradise didn't end like this I swear
Sorry baby girl, I tried the best I could
If I can't be in the streets, I guess heavenís just as good

[Chorus] - w/ ad libs until the end
