Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus: Fabolous]
Tell me what you know about this
Tell me what you know about that
Tell me what you about risk
What you know about getting back
Them niggaz don't live what they rap
Them boys ain't been in no trap
Them niggaz don't know about this
Then boys don't know about that
Ayy, you don't know 'bout it
You don't know 'bout it
Tell me what you know 'bout that
You don't know nothing
You don't know nothing
You don't know nothing
Tell me what you know 'bout that

[Verse 1 - Fabolous]
Hol' up, stop the shit
That's word to that red sign
Don't think cause I'm laid up
I wont flatline your redline
My niggaz tuck guns in
Catch you slippin it's bedtime
Gotta kill you by a certain time
Now that's what I call a deadline
Deadline, deadline
Can't call it like a deadline
When they hit little homie up, I was in Miami getting fed prime
Got my bitch in the studio
She the best, superheadline
Call her my little ghost rider
She help me come with them headlines
headlines, headlines
Put your name in them headlines
Niggaz beefin thats cool
Just give me mine with some red wine
Shouts out to my big homie
When he left he said grind
My nigga move so much Britney Spears
They gave that boy Kevin Fed time
Fed time, fed time
Locked down all day
Real nigga, by myself, Kevin Hart wit it all day
Niiiice
Whoever gon night night nigga
Don't look at that white light nigga
I'm back on this dark shit
If you scared get a night light nigga

[Chorus]

[Verse 2 - Meek Mill]
Crutching all of these bitches
Stuntin' on all of these niggaz
Fifty racks in my pocket
Or on the way to go get it
Northside yeah we poppin'
Now, is never scared of no nigga
Catch me deep down in that jungle
With them lions, snakes and gorillas
I be ridin' round in 4 wheelers
Drop tops and no ceilings
And I ain't talkin' bout Tunechi bitch
Ball hard but can't hoop for shit
Thank God for this?, cause jail cells tuna fish
They locked me down in that hell hole
On state roll like a lunatic
Tell me what you know about this
Tell me what you know about that
Tell me what you know about bricks
32 racks I get you that stamped
Them boys ain't totin' no straps
Them boys ain't up in that trap
Them niggaz ain't bout that life
Tell you 'bout that white and I'm like where it's at?
Nigga

[Chorus]
