Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
It's one o' clock in the morning, still up and I'm yawning
It's obvious that I'm tired, not as much as I'm horny
There's a sign on my dick and it says "Help Wanted"
Told shorty if she want the job fall through and get on it
Fall through and get on it
Fall through and get on it
Know you got that work
I'ma fall through and get on it
Fall through and get on it
Fall through and get on it
Know you got that work
I'ma fall through and get on it

Going through my iPhone, full of girls that I bone
Bunch of niggaz I fuck with, couple of niggaz that I don't
Never mind them lames though, that ain't what a nigga came for
It's about this call of duty, and this shit ain't no game ho
I should call one named Jo, that's short for Joanna
That too legit to quit shit, this bitch just go hammer
Should dial up Dominique, her name should be Dime-I-Freak
Was supposed to be training me, instead we fuck a few times a week
In this corner  Jasmine, on the score card, I give the ass ten
Last time, we went two rounds in the front seat of my Aston
And Brittany like her hair pulled, she crazy, she dareful
That "Nah, we can't do this", turned to "OK but be careful"

[Chorus]

Hit me on my BBM, that D turn into an R if
She ain't trying to come fall through, I leave her on that [?]
Mia like to be comfortable, t-shirt, no drawers and
She call me Ike Turner because I beat her in the car
Beat her in the studio, even hit her friend too
So what, I got out of? Know what we got into
Tiff got them D's on her  daredevil
Down to take her top off wherever
However, Jessica get so wet
Few bottles of Moet, she ain't told me no yet
My Dominicans be the baddest ones
Que tú hace mami? Now come give daddy some

[Chorus]
