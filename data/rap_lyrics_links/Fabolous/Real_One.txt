[Intro: Fabolous]
One time {"Automatik"}
One time
You just need a real one, one time
You just need a real one, ay

[Fabolous]
Heard she in between dudes, just like Lauryn 
Go to work everyday, take the bus like tourin' 
She be curvin' all the locals, must like foreigns 
And this is when I had the Martin, I was just like Lawrence 
So wassup? {"Wassup?!"} Dark windows on the Aston
Who else pull a big daddy up on Mother Gaston?
I'm like "Collar on, it's hard to get role lastin'"
She said "I don't know, it depends who's askin'" 
"Look, I'm Young OG, but you can call me Yogi
You say how real I am but when you do it sound bogie 
So why don't you get to know me? I'll remind you of the homie
And make you forget about everybody that's before me"
She said "I hope so cause them other niggas flow be
Had me gettin' hurt all the time, I'm like Kobe" 
So I be with Adobe, M.I.A like SoBe
All these nigga tryna hit it, even bitches on the low be 
Brooklyn like "Nah son", Harlem like "Yo, B"
It's wet like the ocean, well, +Dick+ like Moby 
We need to stick together, real ones click together
Since we both gettin' to it, we can hit that lick together 
Get that money 

[Chorus: Fabolous + Jazzy]
You just need a real one one time (get that money)
Stack up to a million one time (where we at?)
Back up in the building one time (one time)
Shout out to the real ones one time (ay)
Said you might have had some but you need a real one (ay)
You might have had some but you need a real one (ay)
You might have had some but you need a real one
Said you might have had some but you need a real one {one time}

[Fabolous]
Funny how money change a situation 
Real one come through, make a +Lituation+
When you work for me, it come with vacation 
Trip to LA just to hit crustaceans 
Everybody eats, had the crab with the noodles 
Too busy doin' me to be mad at what you do 
The big dozas out, better grap up your poodles 
Don't let em work that magic cause Fab got that voodoo
Look, Fab go that voodoo, yeah Fab got that voodoo
Stick the pen in your doll, stab up your booboo 
She might have had some but she need a real one
And she a bad one, realest in the building 
And I'm a +Bad Boy+, I Diddy bop on Biggie block 
Bad bitches can't really rock with any thot 
Gotta ball, we really jocks up in the spot
I'm so Brooklyn, I Milly Rock on any block, ahh

[Jazzy]
Y'all need a real one one time
I know 'em when I see 'em one time
Kill 'em, it won't breathe 'em one time
But bae I'll never leave ya one time
You know I'm the type to ride with ya
Sit back late, gettin' high with ya
Kick back, bump this vibe with ya
Baby I just gotta be alive with ya
You complete me baby
So much, listen to me, but boy you fill me up
And I know you need me baby
You know I'm down and know just how to lift me up
So tell me the truth
Is you rockin'? Cause I'm into you
Boy this parkin', I'm not timin' you
Boy come clock in and it's all on you
I'll come knockin', baby I'll be back in no time
Soon as we pause, we hit the rewind
Go back in time, slow down, 69
187, baby you are big crime
And for you I'll do time, for you I'll do time
Long as you repay me with wine and dine
Anything you ask for with me is fine
I'll be your star baby, you my sunshine

[Chorus: Jazzy] + (Fabolous)
(Tell me what you need) I just need a real one one time
(Get that money) Stack up to a million one time
(Where we at?) Back up in the building one time
(One time) Shout out to the real ones one time
(Ay) You might have had some but you need a real one 
(Ay) You might have had some but you need a real one 
(Ay) You might have had some but you need a real one
... One time
