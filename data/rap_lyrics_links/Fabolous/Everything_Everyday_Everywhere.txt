[Intro - Ryan Leslie - talking] (Fabolous)
One, two, R-Les, Loso, we do it like (hey!)
(Yeah! Let's go R-Les)
Just rock with me now (yeah!)
(Yeah, ohh)
NextSelection (ohh)
Haha

[Verse 1 - Fabolous]
Same shit different day, just ride through the city, lookin pretty as the usual
(This what I do)
It's the same old thang, got the name on the chain, just to let 'em know, who's who
(In case you ain't know so)
And they know I've over here, so they come and find me right after they lose you
(What took y'all so long? Haha)
For you niggaz in the way, we can let the guns say - excuse you
(Pardon you lames)
At the end of the day, we just tryin find our way and I might be a come up (nice)
And baby you can hitch a ride but you gotta know how to do more than keep a thumb up
(You ride stick girl?)
It's so incredible that it ain't edible but they know the cake's real
(I'm the Pillsbury Dough Man)
Yo, I couldn't even say, ask these other silicon niggaz how being fake feel

[Chorus - Keri Hilson & Fabolous]
Yay, everyday is my day, I'm a do it my way, everyday, yeah
Everything about me, what they love about me?  Everything, yeah
Everywhere that I be, feel VIP baby, yeah, baby
And everybody's cool, but y'all, just, ain't, me

[Verse 2 - Fabolous]
Somebody better tell 'em that we in this bitch like an unborn baby (hey!)
See we be everywhere and they ain't never there, couldn't tell you where they be
(Where you at baby?)
And you already know you ain't gotta ask me you can see that everything is up
(What's up son?)
And I'm so about my money, you ain't talkin about no money
you ain't even gotta bring it up (Huh?)
And I hope you don't think me give a sugar honey iced tea or a middle finger up (haha)
I just stay sucker free, leave the lames where they be and I let my chips Pringle up
(That means stack)
Everybody calm down, there's enough to go around, you just gotta say how much you want
(Talk to me)
Don't know what you're lookin for, unless it's a problem, I promise this ain't what you want
(Nigga)

[Chorus]

[Break - Keri Hilson - harmonizing for 18 seconds] - w/ ad libs

[Verse 3 - Fabolous]
(Hey!), can you do me this favor?
Answer this question (huh?) - y'all gon' try who? (please)
See the shoes by Gucci, bag by Louie, the hatin'll be by you (hater)
And I appreciate the love, thank the man above
cause a nigga feel so blessed (thank God)
Yeah and I ain't gonna stop, better get 'em Red Bulls
I don't give these haters no rest (yeah)

[Chorus]
