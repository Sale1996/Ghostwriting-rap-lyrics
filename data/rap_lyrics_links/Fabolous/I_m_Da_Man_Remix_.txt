[Intro: DJ Drama]
Street Fi-di-di-di-damn!
{"Gangsta Grizzill!!"}

[Chorus: Red Cafe]
Excuse me! I happen to be the boss man
Excuse me! I happen to be the weatherman
Excuse me! I happen to be the ice man
Excuse me! I happen to be the dopeman
And I'm the man - yes, shorty I'm the man
I'm the man - yes, shorty I'm the man
And I'm the man - yes, shorty I'm the man
I'm the man - yes, shorty I'm the man

[Fabolous]
The motherfuckin man 'Loso
Even better than the past, the present is ours

[Red Cafe]
Yes, UHH~! The man of the hour just fell through
I'm the man with the flour, who the hell are you?
If you need it for cheap, I'm "The Best Man"
like Taye Diggs and you, you just a yes man
I'm the take a nigga bitch man
Buck fifty on the face of a snitch man
I'm paid, I just do this shit for kicks man
If I ain't wearin the Gucci I'm into Richman
Damn! Weatherman, the ice man, the boss man
Bling blaow beotch, Jack Frost man
And I'm a Brooklyn nigga man
I stays off the good dark liquor man
Convict, shakedown, Street Fi-di-di-damn
Good as the yay without the Arm & Hammer man
Blue bandana, red bandana man
Fuck it, snap you a shot like you the camera man

[Chorus]

[Freck Billionaire]
They need a armored car to bring the man jewelry in
Top +Candidate+, call me +Manchurian+
Every stone that's on this man cool
Ain't no Frecks in the streets like a man who
the young bitches say "Let me hold a stack man"
They heard I eat across the board like Pac-Man
I brought some cash up in this bitch like a banker man
Plus I got the news for you, call me anchor man
Drop guap' on the bling no damn delay
I lay money in the ring like Mandalay
She says she left him at home, I said man he sweet
Cause the pussy on this bitch was magnifique
Quick to tell her boyfriend I don't know her man
I just cut the bitch, call me +Lawnmower Man+
If she choosin you should let her off the leash man
All you do is cuff 'em up like police man

[Chorus]

[Paul Cain]
Yeah, yes
If you lookin for the man then you just found him
Touch thousands - I cop, y'all just browsin
Hundred plus Continental spur flyin man
The fireman, I suggest you don't try him man
I keep a back up, just in case the iron jam
I stay strapped, Tony Starks call me +Ironman+
Excuse me, I happen to be the boss man
I get your wings clipped no matter what it cost man
I keep a Ruger, but I ain't gotta shoot a man
Like Pacino with the shooters I'm the recruiter man
Rap's my new hustle, I no longer move the grams
I hit the booth for the change like Superman
The Breitling on right hand is lightning
The bright man like Chris Ayre, the ice man
Light tan on G4 the flight man
The kush keep me high even with the flight lands

[Chorus]

[Fabolous]
Yeah... I'm the man - yes, shorty I'm the man
Lookin for some good shit, then I'm your man
Just say my name three times like Candyman
I pop up, fix it up like a handyman
You know how the man do, Coupe is all mad new
Ginoblis, but the truck is on Kobes
Through the bulletproof when you're in the Sport man
The slugs come through your window like grown man
Aww man~! There go your man again
I fifth him up, stiff him up like a mannequin
I ain't trippin but dude think he the Man of Steel
He slippin up and he don't even see banana peels
And one night I made plans to do him
The bitch is so easy a caveman could do it
She know I'm the man of the da-da-da-da-damn
But F-Y-I, let me tell you who I am (BITCH!)

[Chorus]
