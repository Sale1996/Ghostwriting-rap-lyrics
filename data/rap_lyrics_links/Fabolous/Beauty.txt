[Intro: Fabolous]
This just feels, beautiful

[Verse One: Fabolous]
Beauty's when you just got out the shower
Hair still drippin wrapped up in the towel
Beauty's when you ready in a hour
Them long legs I call them the Twin Towers
You put that arch in it, put that hand on 'yo hip
Put yo' hair in a bun, and you handle the shit
Beauty's when the strut compliments ass
You know yo' beauty look good with yo' confident ass
Shit! Straight up! But the rest work
You know it's beauty when her smile is her best curve
That's real beauty, no makeup shit
The girl you dream about, and wanna wake up with
Wait until I'm lookin and you throw it at me
Go down on me then you look up at me
Awww man that shit right there!
Probably give yo' ex nightmares

[Interlude: Wale]
Miss Brooklyn New York, I give you whatever to get to your heart
Know your worth baby girl, love
The Soul Tape shit, nuff to make shift
All natural, put it down, Young Ralph, let's get it

[Verse Two: Wale]
Beauty is knowin nobody real as you (WOO!!!)
Truly condolences for that pair of shoes
Killin the scene this type of love will make you complete
Now roll the weed and get the munchies she be in cuisine
I'm in her jeans and still in tuned with her inner being
Her inner thoughts her worst fears she give to me
Beauty is loyalty to the fullest
'Cause Cupid made me your target for she ever see the bullet
For she a get super deep maybe speed out before pull out 
If sex is a weapon, her beauty don't need a bullet
Beauty, is the beauty, that her mother gave her
May you be brought about God me and grandmama's angels
It's God given, never complicated
Alot of niggas talkin that don't got the heart to say it
Now I can tell you I see potential in how you do it
I pray you know your worth when niggas don't notice your beauty
Truly! Ralph!

[Outro: Fabolous]
You see beauty isn't rushed, it's a process 
Sometimes it's slow, yeah
I mean it's beauty in everything you know
You just gotta recognize it
Shoutout to the people who do, and I feel sorry for the people who don't
