[R-Les]
All my ladies killin em get your hands up
All my ladies killin em get them hands up
If you really killin' em keep them hands up
Keep them hands up, up

(If you killin em)

Get your hands up
All my ladies killin em get your hands up
And if you really killin' em keep them hands up
If you killin em

[Fabolous]
You be killin' 'em
Girl you be killin' 'em
That girl bad, I mean badder than villian
I'm a let you know girl, that's how real I am
Swagga on a hundred thousand trillion
Girl I mean look at you
I'm not gon' judge, cause I woulda thrown the book at you
See a murder case every time I take a look at you
Where the ladies who be killin em

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
When you put that over me
Hard that I can see baby?
It's damn, girl look at you
Girl you fly as fly can be
And nothing I can say baby
It's damn, look at her
Girl you look incredible
(So good you killin em)
Flawless girl from head to toe
Girl you killin em
Ain't nobody touch you know
Ooh girl you killin' em
Girl you are

Girl you be killin em
You be killin em

[Fabolous]
You be killin that
Girl you be killin that
She do it with no hands and I be feelin' that
Then she yellow tape anywhere she chillin' at
You need tear drops baby, killer tatts
From New York to Cali, back down to Florida
Her shoes made by a foreigner, call the coroner
They should arrest you, at least isssue you a warrant for they way you be killin' em
Ne-Yo bring the chorus bru...

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]

[R-Les]
All my ladies killin em get your hands up
All my ladies killin em get them hands up
If you really killin' em keep them hands up
Keep them hands up, up

(If you killin em)

Get your hands up
All my ladies killin em get your hands up
And if you really killin' em keep them hands up
If you killin em

[Chorus: Ne-Yo]
