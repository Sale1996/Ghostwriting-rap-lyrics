[Fabolous]
She callin' me Fablo, she think that I'm Pablo (Esco)
She watch too much "Narcos", she think I'm the narco (let's go)
I buy 'til the bar close, I hit Neiman Marcus (blow that)
Fuck a Wells Fargo, it's stacks in my cargos (you know that)
Griselda Blanco, she got the donk though (okay)
Whippin' that foreign, like it's the Bronco (okay)
I'm on the highway, like I caught a body (woo!)
Me and compadre, smokin' beats by Dre
Loud to the head (head) takin' loud to the head (head)
First we count up the blessings (blessings) then we count up the bread (bread)
I can count on the squad (squad) I can count 'em like one two three (ay)
Everything gotta run through me (ay) you know Jefe the one to see, yeah
Don't you get comfortable nigga cause that's when they come for you nigga 
Not here to comfort you nigga, lay you like comforter nigga, you know where I come from my nigga 
I am from the iron jungle my nigga, I done seen the lions rumble my nigga
Listen up you Brian Gumbel ass niggas, Young OG is back to humble you niggas
Plug

[Chorus: Fabolous]
I got what you want, I know what you waaant (I know what you want)
I got what you need, I know what you neeeed (I know what you need)
I got what you like, I know what you liiike (I know what you like)
I got what you love, I am your plu-u-u-ug
She fell in love, she fell in lo-o-o-ove
She want the plug, she want the plu-u-u-g
She fell in love, she want the plu-u-u-ug
She fell in love, she want the plu-u-u-ug 

[Fabolous]
She givin' me besos, she feelin' my dress code
I blame Ernesto, it's your fault Ernesto 
Took me to the West Coast, linked me with Nate Dogg 
I gotta cook up now, ain't no marinate dawg
It's no time to wait dawg, wait dawg, wait dawg
We done sellin' weight dawg, weight dawg, weight dawg
If I fell away dawg, they feel a way dawg
They come with AK's dawg, like it's Kuwait dawg
All we, know is, B.I.T.E., we a-ggressive, sharks 
Don't you, ask us, nothin', fuck a, question, mark
Flyest, nigga, in it, spit the, freshest, bars
This is, "Narco", swag, call me, Freshco-bar 

[Chorus]

[Fabolous]
Leave me some head, she need a plu-u-u-ug
Fuckin' me good, she need a plu-u-u-ug
Holdin' me down, she be the plu-u-u-ug
Whatever I need, she be the plu-u-u-ug
