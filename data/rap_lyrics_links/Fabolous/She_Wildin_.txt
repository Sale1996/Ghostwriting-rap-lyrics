[Chris] Ooh she wildin' wildin' {*2X*}

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
(Ooh she wildin') Ooh she wildin' wildin', she do her thang thang (yeah)
Ooh she wildin' wildin', she do her thang thang (yeah)
(Ooh she wildin') Ooh she wildin' wildin', she do her thang thang (yeah)
Ooh she wildin' wildin', she do her thang thang (she wildin')
She just wanna shake something
Girl that ass gon' make money
(Ooh she wildin') Ooh she wildin' wildin', she do her thang thang 
Ooh she wildin' wildin', she do her thang thang (she wildin' wildin')
Said she like it raw, beat that pussy up
You ain't never fuck a thug, you gon' fall in in love
A bottle of that liquid courage on the way now
All my ladies takin' shots, I know that they down (she wildin' wildin')

[Fabolous]
I said ooh she wildin' wildin', she do her thang thang
Lames get shot down, she do a bang bang
She attract rappers and the ones who do the same thang
Playas in the league and the dope boy who slang thangs
All tryna pull up on her, all she do is lane change
They be all in the air, 100 be the main thing
Tryna lock her down, she ain't with the Chain Gang
Wanna make her wifey but, no name change
She be on that Brikin to Chanel type of name change
She be stuntin', she be on her Jackie Chan thang
Big set Rollies in the sky, let your thang swang
Might wear the iced out, might Plain Jane
Either way you know what time it is, gotta maintain
Mr. Chows' girl, not a PF Chang thang
Whole crew bad, it's a Pretty Gang thang
Long hair, don't care, let it hang thang - ooh 

[Chorus]

[Fabolous]
I said ooh she pop a molly and do her thang thang
Take the grapefruit and do that brain thang
Man, that ruby red, that shit done changed things
I'm about to bust, but before I go bang bang
Hold up, she climb up on it like she King Kong
Back and forth on that table like she ping pong
She tell me "Play the dirty version, not the clean song"
She tell me fuck her in the dark with my bling on {*echoes*}
And she do this thing to me she know I like (yeah)
She need no one to check, she know that mic (yeah)
She like when Spider-Man climb up them walls (ooh)
She be so wet, feel like you in The Falls (ooh)
She like Niagara, man fuck your Viagra (whoa)
She make you cum fast and fuck up your swagger (whoa)
She make you come back, like that boomerang (nice)
Ooh she be wildin' when she do her thang
... When she do her thang
... When she do her thang
... When she do her thang
Ooh she be wildin', when she do her thang

[Chris Brown]
Ooh she wildin' (yeeeah-eah, yeah)
Ooh she wildin' - Ohh nooo, ooh she

[Chorus]
