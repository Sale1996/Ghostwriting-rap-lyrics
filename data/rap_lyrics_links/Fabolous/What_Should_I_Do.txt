[verse 1]
dear fab
I wrote this letter in confidence you will read it
I suceeded getting my collage education completed
smart girl not conceded I'm used to being treated anyway
but anyway
your advice is needed
I'm 22 years old
with a beautiful daughter
by a dead beat who wouldnt give a quarter to support her
my money was gettin low
and my patience was getting shorter
heard about his new gf and all the shit he brought
so I caught, fought her, heard she had restraining orders
I still grabbed her pony tail and held her under water
so right now I'm sorta locked up for manslaughter
missing every minute I can't spend with my daughter

[chorus]
does anyone care (anyone care)
please tell me
I'm alone and scared (alone and scared)
please help mee
what should I do (what should I do)
what should I do (what should I do)
what should I do
please tell me
please tell me

[verse 2]
loso
I know you hold profession as a lyricist
but you probly never had depression as severe as this
your music, its like a session with a therapist
I asked the lord to send me any blessin if his hearin this
I'm stresssin sumfin serious
pressin on delirous
a smart man always ask's questions if he's curious
I believe in god, but I don't understand his plan
why send a spanish man, way up to afganistan?
hand this man a rifle
suit me up in camoflauge
I salute the hand of sarge
he is not a man in charge
I'm fightin this war
don't kno who I'm fightin it for
might be goin awol anyday ya'll

[chorus]
does anyone care (anyone care)
please tell me
I'm alone and scared (alone and scared)
please help mee
what should I do (what should I do)
what should I do (what should I do)
what should I do
please tell me
please tell me

[verse 3]
dear fabolous
I'm such a fan
I don't have much demands
but I'm really hopin that you will keep in touch with fans
cause see
I know your probly busy kickin it with one of them pretty girls from on
television shaking it
my vision ain't mistaken, I can see you wasnt faking
so I hope, that you can help me with some good decision making
i've been thinkin a lot, so much I havn't slept in days
my mother and father about to go there seperate ways
I'm a teen in the cross of a painful divorce
I love my mum and she thinks I'm an angel of course
I love my dad too
I feel tangled and lost
who's side should I be on?
your friend deon

[chorus]

yeah this song is dedicated to anyone who find theyself in a place where they
need

some advice
you may not always find that person in the physical form
but theres someone you can trust in
who listens when everybodies ears are shut
who sees when everybodies eyes are closed
who speaks when everybodies voices is silent
put your faith in god
the man will take you from there
loso

cause not a day goes by, that I don't wonder why
and what should I do
