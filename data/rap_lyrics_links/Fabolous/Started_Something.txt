[Chorus: Daphne Larue]
Understand me, you fuckin' with the family
You know who my man be - niggas done started somethin'
Ungrateful, I see what the hate do 
Even though we made you - niggas done started somethin'
If you try to play me 
You crazy, you crazy - niggas done started somethin'
If you try to play me 
You crazy, you crazy - niggas done started somethin'

[Fabolous]
Yeah...
You bit off more than you can chew, ain't much more that I could do 
than go look for you niggas, I got a warrant for your crew 
Y'all done got me started, put me in this position
Pushed my buttons, put the key in my ignition 
Nigga once the engine runnin', I'm comin' to injure somethin'
Fuck me like I'm sex, promise revenge is comin'
Sometimes, can't wait for karma to get 'em back 
And momma said "If they hit you, you better hit 'em back"
See, that's how I was raised, that's how I'm not phased
Cause I'm worth too much nigga, that's how I appraise 
I done cut off the frauds, disappeared enemies
I'm not a fan of phony vibes and weird energy
Even a friend of me, started hatin' on a G
It seem petty like Bruce spelling his Kaitlyn with a C 
Man I see it all, if he tazed me, it wouldn't shock me
Dawg I heard it all, if you Jay-Z, you couldn't rock/Roc me
Couldn't +Knock+ me, so they had to go another route
White sheets over you, for helpin' undercovers out 
Like Thanksgiving day, slide through your mother house
We gon' pull them muffins out, blow a nigga stuffin out 
Shorty you know nothin' 'bout, finishin' games
This the flow that blemish yo name, deminish yo fame
Boy your whole style is trash, your image is lame
I'll set yo' ass on fire, then extinguish yo' flame (woo!)
From start to finish, I finish then I start again
Ran into yo broad again, I met her at the Party Inn
Fed her that Bacardi then, spread it like acordians 
Then she made it clap for me, better than the audience
She say you keep callin', tryna get her into arguments
How you was cool but now you sweater like a cardigan
Once you get a real nigga, get rid of the fraudulent
I can handle that baby, tell me where he at baby

[Chorus]
