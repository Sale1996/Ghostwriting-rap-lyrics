[Intro: Fabolous]
I see dead people, I see dead people
I look in my pocket and I see dead people
I see dead people, I see dead people
I look in my pocket and I see dead people
One, two, three, body count
One, two, three, e'rybody count
One, two, three, body count
I check my other pockets, more bodies found

[Fabolous]
Mo' bodies, I'm back for mo' bodies
The competition is a skinny bitch, no body
I'm runnin and I knows it, that's why I'm so snotty
You little boys sit yo' ass down, go potty
I see dead people, I see dead people
I look in my pocket and I see dead people
One, two, three, body count
I check my other pocket, more bodies found

[Fabolous]
Let's keep it a hundred, that's word to Ben Frank
Money's what you can count on when your friends ain't
Grass green over here, green like the kushes
I got Presidents in my jeans like the Bushes
And we don't chase money - we chase dreams
Rub this money in your face - face cream
Doctors say I have a problem I see nuttin but the bread
Told me close my eyes "what you see," y'all know what I said!

[Chorus]

[Fabolous]
And if I go, make sure the family gets the cash
And at my funeral there's only one wish I ask
Give the haters a chance to see me cause this they last
Turn me over and one by one let 'em kiss my ass
I see dead people, I see dead people
Pocket full of ego, big head people
One two three, body count risin
Now e'rybody got their hand out, fuckin Heisman
Your boy just convinced her that she gorgeous
Must have took a couple thousand of them Georges
They call me Funeral, they call us broadtrich
Face on point, they should call us swordfish
He got a gang of money, you can't stop his drive
He in the blue six screamin out stop it five
Black out jewelry, you still see it though
I make a movie in the club, gotta see it yo

[Chorus]
