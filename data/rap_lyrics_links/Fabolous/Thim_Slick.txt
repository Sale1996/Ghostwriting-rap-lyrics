[Fabolous]
Sometimes I like slim, sometimes I like thick
Sometimes I combine them and I like thim slick
Thim slick probably went over your head
Couldn't lay up, I just went over for head
Made a change of plans when she bent over the bed
Now she on the balcony pint over the ledge
Been a few days, but I sent over some bread
It can get rough with tuition and ran over your head
Not to save hoes or rescue anybody
But a nigga know what stress do to the body
And I done seen you in your best shoes buzzin' naughty
Shit be lookin' like fresh shoes on Bugatti's
... And I don't who invented high heels
... But I swear we all on one
... And if you do know that man, girl
... I be like ''where you know him from?''
You so slick, so small, curvy
Teeth all pearly, hair all curly
Was a tomboy, now you all girly
Never look tired, but you wake up all early
Hit the gym, keep it toned up
Progress pic, holding your phone up
Aw shit, waist getting smaller
Niggas on Instagram like ''Damn, I need to call her''

[Chorus: Jeremih] + (Fabolous)
That body's, per-fect, in, my, eyes
No matter what they say, everything lookin' just fine
You got that, blessing, in dis-guise
You wouldn't know... girl you got it
(Thim slick girls get me every time) Girl you got it
(Thim slick girls could get every dime) Girl you got it
(Thim slick girls get me every time) Girl you got it
(Thim slick girls could get every dime) Girl you got it

[Fabolous] + {Jeremih}
She like ''Hold up, let me throw on something light'' (damn)
Bitch really went and threw on something tight (haha)
Came downstairs in her Superwoman tights like
''Dida dida, dida dida dida''
Damn, I ain't know you was holding like that
I ain't know brown skin Kelly Rowland like that
Never knew you had it with your sneaky ass
She said ''I never seen you looking with your peaking ass''
34, 24, 36
Finally got a selfie after taking thirty pics
36, 24, 40
D-cupa caption, double cup shorty
And it's angles to this shit, angles to this shit
Gotta hold her phone up and put the angle on the pics
And then they poke it out and put an angle on that hip
Having thirsty niggas come from every angle at that bitch
Lord, Heard when they thinner you get deeper in her
They say when they thicker they make you cum quicker
{Thim slick girls get me every time}
{Thim slick girls could get every dime}
That ass in the gym; squat life
Gotta show 'em love in the era of the shot life
This is all from my mama, this is not knife
Niggas love her shit, give a fuck about likes

[Chorus]
