Ha ha ha ha ha<end_line>
See ma, I think you took it <end_line>
I think you took it wrong like<end_line>
You got it misunderstood or something<end_line>
You got it confused<end_line>

<verse_start>
I'm thinking about the one night we have spent together<end_line>
That I'd cherish the love I thought would last forever<end_line>
Call meee<end_line>
Call meee<end_line>

Girl, that was a one night fling<end_line>
You was turned on by the moonshine and the sunlight bling<end_line>
You kept licking your tongue at me, knowing how quick that this young'n be<end_line>
To pull out his dick from his dungarees<end_line>
Besides, we had enough liquor and jungle trees <end_line>
That both of us woulda got sick or had lung disease<end_line>
I remember every gesture made<end_line>
During the escapade<end_line>
In the back of the Escalade<end_line>
When it come to tricks, I have some up my sleeve<end_line>
But Shorty dived in head first and didn't come up to breathe<end_line>
I usually don't get to rag em<end_line>
But it's so real, I made the caddy chauffer hop out and get the magnums<end_line>
We getting close the Park of Meridian<end_line>
She pulling her skirt down<end_line>
And tucking her titties in<end_line>
I'm walking this biddy in<end_line>
Caressing her pretty skin <end_line>
She said "I love the video that you and P. Diddy in"<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Now I aint seen Shorty since the spot last summer<end_line>
And she still calling and paging<end_line>
I don't even know how she got my numbers<end_line>
But I been hiding<end_line>
Cuz, this girl looking for the kid like Bush was searching for Bin Laden<end_line>
Before I didn't care if she where I be<end_line>
But now I mean it be scaring me<end_line>
To get year of free therapy<end_line>
She said her heart broken; it caused her to start smoking<end_line>
And the hours of deep thinking, making her keep drinking<end_line>
Since Hiedi started stalking me<end_line>
I hadda get body guards to walk with me<end_line>
If you wanna get Fabolous, that's on you, that's on you<end_line>
Long as you know they at on you<end_line>
I'm looking at her ways and reactions<end_line>
Hoping that this don't turn into a fatal attraction<end_line>
She screaming "fabolous give me one more chance<end_line>
Fabolous give me one more chance" PLEASE?!<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I'm thinking about the one night we have spent together<end_line>
That I'd cherish the love I thought would last forever<end_line>
Call meee<end_line>
Call meee<end_line>
