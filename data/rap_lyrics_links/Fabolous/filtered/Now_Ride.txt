Niggaz ain't gon' be happy till I click on a rage<end_line>
Pick up a gauge, and it's my face, that they stick on front page<end_line>
Gotta be careful, I could pull a thick of the age<end_line>
Chick on the stage, and winde up, sick in a cage<end_line>
When I come through, it's usually in Dickies that's beige<end_line>
Pushing a "Eleanor", like I'm Nicholas Cage<end_line>
And it's funny how a few bucks can<end_line>
Get you put under a white sheet, like you in the Ku Klux Klan<end_line>
It's Street Fam' for life, we ride to the death<end_line>
We play hard dog, don't cry to the rest<end_line>
I don't know you, please move to the left<end_line>
Or stay here and get introduced to the tefs<end_line>
I'm riding till the wheels come off it<end_line>
Grindin till a mil' come off it<end_line>
This is my plate, I eat every meal from off it<end_line>
Why y'all try and steal crumbs off it, jump!<end_line>

<verse_start>
Now when I spray wit the sauer, I gotta spend a day wit the lawyer<end_line>
Worryin bout, who say that saw ya<end_line>
Keep yay wit the oyers, two kids on the block<end_line>
Like when Mourning and Mutumbo, used to play wit the Hoyas<end_line>
I'ma boss, that you can never upstand<end_line>
Or get a red dot on you, like a 7Up can<end_line>
Some of y'all caught feelings from way back<end_line>
Others waited till I came through, short willing the Maybach<end_line>
But I'm still bucking like, five, duce, four, trey<end_line>
Still tucking and letting the fo' spray<end_line>
Still ducking where ever the po's lay<end_line>
And still fucking, and making them hoes say, WHOA!<end_line>
...And I know Fed's seen<end_line>
The old school Chevy, with the dope head lean<end_line>
Y'all love the way I R-I-D-E<end_line>
Call my D.E., and put you on a R.I.P.T., ghetto<end_line>
