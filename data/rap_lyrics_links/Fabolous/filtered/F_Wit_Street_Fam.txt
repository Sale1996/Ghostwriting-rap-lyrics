I tell it like it is, motherfuck how it was<end_line>
The shit a coward does won't fuck up my sour buzz<end_line>

Back from the future, on some Party McFly shit<end_line>
The doors go up, and lord knows I shit<end_line>

You don't wanna see me reachin where that trunk switch is<end_line>
We in the club with the black and white skunk riches<end_line>

I make them hoes throw it up like drunk bitches<end_line>
If not, "Walk it Out" like Unk bitches<end_line>
Two-step your ass on<end_line>
You missed the knock, oppurtunity done passed on<end_line>

You wanna hate us, take a number and get in line<end_line>
These niggaz start throwin shade when you gettin shine<end_line>
And I'm gettin mine, like southern Cal<end_line>
Too hot to touch, just came out the oven style<end_line>
Ask my momma, I came out the oven wild<end_line>
My flow is city slick, slow it down Southern style<end_line>
Two fingers up, two fingers down<end_line>
If ya like your chick nigga don't bring her 'round<end_line>
The Bob Barker king in town<end_line>

Baby come on down - wait!<end_line>
