<verse_start>
Uhh, playa, playa<end_line>
First you tell the jeweler to Audemar Piguet ya<end_line>
Then you tellin' waitresses to Rose her<end_line>
Bumpin VIP and you meet your first Draya<end_line>
In the strip club, ones in the air-ya<end_line>
Nothin' but attention that they wanna pay ya<end_line>
Dancers tryna welcome to L.A. ya<end_line>
Shake it like a polaroid picture, +Hey Ya+<end_line>
Let 'em know you ballin', you that nigga playa<end_line>
And you run the city you the new mayor<end_line>
Tonight is full of hoes and the flyest playas<end_line>
Can't forget the jackers and the playa haters<end_line>
And shady hoes can't wait to be-tray ya<end_line>
It's hard to tell which one is here to slay ya<end_line>
Nigga be that pretty redbone lay up<end_line>
Texting to the niggas that are tryna lay her<end_line>
The lights is coming on and you drunk as sailor<end_line>
Shawty like where the after party playa?<end_line>
You grab her by the hand and tell her I'ma take ya<end_line>
Shawty rollin' with it she is not a faker<end_line>
Now you with your wheel like a roller skater<end_line>
Pullin' out the lot you tell your homies "Later!"<end_line>
Stopping at the light corner of La Brea<end_line>
Niggas ride up on ya like a escalator<end_line>
Wearin' all-black Oakland Raider<end_line>
Screamin' run your shit 'fore they AK ya<end_line>
Begging for your life hopin' they don't spray ya<end_line>
Shoulda left that balla shit for the Lakers, yeah<end_line>
<verse_end>
