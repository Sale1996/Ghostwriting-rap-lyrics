<verse_start>
Who want to bet us that they can't fuck with us?<end_line>
Stack cheddar forever, live treacherous, all the etceteras<end_line>
Until the death of us, me and my confidantes, we shine<end_line>
We make the ambiance, you niggas just rhyme<end_line>
You little niggas need guidance, you barkin' up the wrong trees<end_line>
Pissin' on the wrong hydrants; I'm a high fence<end_line>
I grew up around violence, you grew up playin' violins<end_line>
In your hood - silence; where I'm from - sirens<end_line>
They just killed this vibe, they just killed this vibe<end_line>
There's something about killin' shit that makes us feel alive<end_line>
We feed off your energy, we see you on that Kenny G<end_line>
Just tooting your own horn, do your thing my N-I-G<end_line>
Whenever you "ven aqui" to that mighty NYC<end_line>
We gon' check that name you claim, bring yourand I.D<end_line>
We take it the wrong way, all gold, everything<end_line>
One gold watch, two gold chains, give me all those - everything<end_line>
Y'all don't want to bump heads -- Ocho, Evelyn<end_line>
Them boys will leave you butt naked, the mall closed and everything<end_line>
The Streets Is Watching, asking if you gon' reply to them<end_line>
Seems like I woke up sleeping giants - Eli and them<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I'm like Nino with the uzi back of the motorcycle heading<end_line>
to get back at them Italians who killed Keisha at the wedding<end_line>
I'm like Doughboy lookin' for Ricky's killer - one last soldier<end_line>
Niggas who turn they backs on me turn your punk ass over<end_line>
Y'all smoked my cousin Harold, now I'm in the Camaro<end_line>
Loving and Happiness playin', me and my dog with this double barrel<end_line>
38, 40 belows, live or die motherfucker<end_line>
I'm Pac, you Radames "Riverside Motherfucker~!"<end_line>
The get back everybody better get back, tell my niggas in the jet black<end_line>
Until the seats let back on your jet back, if you're a gamblin' man you could bet that<end_line>
It's a "sure thing not just a New York thing or a rich or a poor" thing<end_line>
It's a "lace your boots pull your drawstring who want to go to war" thing<end_line>
It's a "who gon' protect your thing who really want it more" thing<end_line>
"Puttin' legends in coffins and some bullet holes in the door" thing<end_line>
It's a "nobody saw things, street cold not a law" thing<end_line>
It's "kids that wasn't taught things, old ladies like poor" thing<end_line>
Poor thing and the get back is impor-tant<end_line>
Poor thing for the dead homies, we pour 'pagne<end_line>
Like what you say while it's cocked back to him<end_line>
Guess what goes around comes around got back to him<end_line>
<verse_end>
