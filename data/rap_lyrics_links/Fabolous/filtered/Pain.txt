<verse_start>
I'm old enough to know better, young enough to not give a fuck<end_line>
Rather hold my high and die then live and duck<end_line>
If you're cool being taken down and giving up<end_line>
Your lifestyle's a blow job, the way you're living sucks!<end_line>
I done felt pain, waited but no help came<end_line>
Went through some crazy shit still kept myself sane<end_line>
You ever been dying of thirst and smelt rain<end_line>
Ever been told "go to hell" and felt flames<end_line>
The water's to your neck and only gets deeper<end_line>
Its all down hill and it only gets steeper<end_line>
Gotta get over it, be a hurdle leaper<end_line>
It cost to be the boss, it ain't get no cheaper<end_line>
But there's a man above that we all under bro<end_line>
No bread truck but he work wonders though!<end_line>
After you wake up, everything is wonderful<end_line>
You can overcome anything you undergo<end_line>
As an artist I'm just tryna paint the perfect picture<end_line>
But see where tryna wait for somebody that's perfect gets you<end_line>
That usually lead to nothing like virgin kisses<end_line>
And I be tryna cut, surgeon bitches<end_line>
Dreams of splurging riches, pretty but curvy misses<end_line>
Chef to serve the dishes, driving to swerve the ditches<end_line>
I'm just another kid on the purple wishes?<end_line>
And the streets is tough, on the verge of viscious<end_line>
So I sold weed and crack, business<end_line>
That white girl helped a nigga, Fergalicious<end_line>
But getting money bring jealousy and verbal disses<end_line>
So when you killin' shit watch out for the murder witness<end_line>
An old head told me, let nothing disturb your business<end_line>
Beef is only good when you in the burger business<end_line>
So I chilled, but loaded up the steal<end_line>
Like I wish a nigga would, But I know a nigga will<end_line>
But for real you loaded up to kill<end_line>
Cause soon as a nigga could the sooner a nigga will<end_line>
And I don't owe these niggaz nothing<end_line>
Put that in a nigga will<end_line>
<verse_end>
