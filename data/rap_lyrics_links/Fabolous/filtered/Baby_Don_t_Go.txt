Now I'm better than your ex, gon' be better than your next<end_line>
Baby Screwed Up so you better be from Tex-as<end_line>
Can't seem to doubt that I creamed her out<end_line>
Now you dream about how I turned Nieman out<end_line>
Nothin to scream about just back your Beemer out<end_line>
Pack it up in the trunk, go back to Kima house<end_line>
Cause I can play cool, but I can't play fool<end_line>
There's options in break up, you ever play pool?<end_line>
Better do you cause I damn sure does me<end_line>
And what your buzz be is only because of me<end_line>
The wifey, hus-by, never was me<end_line>
I does me, trust me<end_line>

But I got another boo, on the side, bay-bay<end_line>

<verse_start>
Through the time I been alone, time I spent on phones<end_line>
Know you ain't lettin them climb up in my throne<end_line>
Now, baby that lime with that Patron<end_line>
Have me talkin crazy, it's time to come on home<end_line>
Now, I talk with someone above<end_line>
It's okay to lose your pride over someone you love<end_line>
Don't lose someone you love though over your pride<end_line>
Stick wit'cha entree and get over your side<end_line>
We break up to make up at Jacob's baby<end_line>
Her parents fought too, I'm the makeup baby<end_line>
Wake up baby, love'll have you open though<end_line>
I mean you seen Tom Cruise on the Oprah show<end_line>
So I just can't bet on the next hand<end_line>
There's too much in this pot just to give to the next man<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Now if you ain't never went through it you ain't really into it<end_line>
The neck scratches show you I really been through it<end_line>
Every other day I'm givin the love away<end_line>
That's what your friend's sister or little brother say<end_line>
If I'ma do somethin, it's the undercover way<end_line>
When them hatin ass watchdogs look the other way<end_line>
And others may not see that we need each other<end_line>
But if we on the same page we can read each other<end_line>
They should learn us, instead of try to turn us<end_line>
Mr. and Ms. Smith, we both got the burners - UP~!<end_line>
If you love your baby then turn this up<end_line>
Know we keep this hot like a Thermos cup<end_line>
Relax, don't be tryin to perm us up<end_line>
We already straight - yesss<end_line>
