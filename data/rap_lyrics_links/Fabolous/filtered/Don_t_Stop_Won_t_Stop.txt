<verse_start>
It's been a year and some change<end_line>
And I've been hearin' some things<end_line>
That there's some motherfuckers tryin' to be me<end_line>
But ain't none of these motherfuckers tryin' to see me<end_line>
So I won't stop, and I don't stop, yeah<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
It's like everywhere I look and everywhere I go<end_line>
I'm hearin' muh'fucka's tryin'a steal my flow<end_line>
But it ain't no thing cause see my nigga J.O<end_line>
Put me up on the game when I stepped through the do'<end_line>
Now I done been so many places and seen so many faces<end_line>
But none of these motherfuckers do it like me<end_line>
Don't no motherfuckin' click do it like we<end_line>
Guess I'm doin' the right thing like Spike Lee<end_line>
See they talk like they some ho's, I walk like I'm supposed<end_line>
But if they get in the way they get stepped on<end_line>
It's the hundred-thou with the bling kept on<end_line>
Dippin' on my semi-automatic weap-on<end_line>
I ain't playin' no games, and I ain't sayin' no names<end_line>
Nigga put the shoes on if they fit you<end_line>
Well there's two things that I'm gon' admit to<end_line>
That I won't stop, and I don't stop<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I take whatever come wit the wealth, and even humble myself<end_line>
But I ain't the kinda nigga you can style on<end_line>
I got a coupe that I'm finna' put some miles on<end_line>
And I ride on these niggaz wit a smile on<end_line>
See I'm 'bout stackin' money but when they start actin' funny<end_line>
I fall back and all a man do is laugh<end_line>
I'm the kinda player that ain't gotta do the draft<end_line>
Buncha hits, couple plaques nigga do the math<end_line>
But a nigga must be gone for gettin' his hustle on<end_line>
So I had to come through and take the corner back<end_line>
And I'm back wit the rubber bands on a stack<end_line>
Nigga quit or take what I give on a pack<end_line>
Girls still think I'm fly<end_line>
Blow kiss and wink the eye<end_line>
And tell me they wanna go somewhere and freak off<end_line>
I tell 'em I would love to stop and take the week off<end_line>
But I won't stop, and I don't stop<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I listen to niggaz flippin' my lines<end_line>
And be grippin' my nine<end_line>
Like damn niggaz flip and only spit game<end_line>
Niggaz comin' at me tryin' to get names<end_line>
Niggaz lookin like me tryin' to get fame<end_line>
See first it didn't matter, and I was a little flattered<end_line>
But now these young boys they gettin' too grown<end_line>
Like I ain't show 'em how to rock jewels two toned<end_line>
But it won't stop, and it don't stop<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
It's like everywhere I look and everywhere I go<end_line>
I'm hearin' muh'fucka's tryin'a steal my flow<end_line>
But it ain't no thing cause see my nigga J.O.<end_line>
Put me up on the game when I stepped through the do'<end_line>
<verse_end>
