They call me Paperman, Paperman, in that brand new Chevy Sedan<end_line>

This player is good at home, like Kobe in Staples man<end_line>

Even if they don't understand the flow, bet them hoes understand the dough<end_line>
Every motherfucker on this planet know, money keeps the world on spin<end_line>
If I put the spur on in, ain't no doubt yo' girl gone grin<end_line>

Don't slip, don't trip cause the tips are hollow<end_line>
