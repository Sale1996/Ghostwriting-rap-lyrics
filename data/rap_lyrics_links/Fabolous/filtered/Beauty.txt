<verse_start>
Beauty's when you just got out the shower<end_line>
Hair still drippin wrapped up in the towel<end_line>
Beauty's when you ready in a hour<end_line>
Them long legs I call them the Twin Towers<end_line>
You put that arch in it, put that hand on 'yo hip<end_line>
Put yo' hair in a bun, and you handle the shit<end_line>
Beauty's when the strut compliments ass<end_line>
You know yo' beauty look good with yo' confident ass<end_line>
Shit! Straight up! But the rest work<end_line>
You know it's beauty when her smile is her best curve<end_line>
That's real beauty, no makeup shit<end_line>
The girl you dream about, and wanna wake up with<end_line>
Wait until I'm lookin and you throw it at me<end_line>
Go down on me then you look up at me<end_line>
Awww man that shit right there!<end_line>
Probably give yo' ex nightmares<end_line>
