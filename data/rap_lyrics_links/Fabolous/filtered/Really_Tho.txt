Me and my niggaz talkin' shit at the pool table<end_line>
Wanna know who sat these nerds at the cool table?<end_line>
Who let these unimportant hoes in the VIP?<end_line>
Who let these little niggaz in? I need to see ID<end_line>
Real real real re really tho<end_line>
These lames never paid attention so they really owe<end_line>
I know some R&B bitches that can really blow<end_line>
Turkey burgers and hot chocolate, really ho?<end_line>
When shit get real now then it's "I'm just playin'"<end_line>
When people hating now then it's "I'm just sayin'"<end_line>
Fake this and fake that got you feeling yourself?<end_line>
You can't be real with me, you ain't even real with yourself<end_line>

Me and some fly girls chillin' where the bar is<end_line>
Wanna know when y'all gon' stop treasuring garbage?<end_line>
When they gon' get they own and stop minding our biz?<end_line>
When these Bride of Chucky Dolls became Barbies?<end_line>
Real re re re I'm really certain<end_line>
If everybody a boss, then who's really workin'?<end_line>
If they say they got that raw shit, that really mean<end_line>
Them white squares is stepped on, Billie Jean<end_line>
Rather a real enemy than a fake friend<end_line>
Rather know for sure, than be mistaken<end_line>
One thing you should know, when you play the game<end_line>
Lies always change, the truth stay the same<end_line>
