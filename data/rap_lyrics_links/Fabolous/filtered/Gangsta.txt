I'm still living la vida loca<end_line>
Where hoes sell prices on weed or coke-a<end_line>
For the hustlers, for the customers, trust the buzz<end_line>
It's have you makin' one of the sounds that Busta does<end_line>
They love me just because<end_line>
I'm in the gallardo, laughing like Ricky Ricardo<end_line>
With the 4-pounder, pretty gangsta nigga<end_line>
I'm the co-founder, I know the difference between pimps and hoe-hounders<end_line>
I can tell when they ain't learn to lean<end_line>
They gold cups missing stones, turning green<end_line>
I roll up wrist in chrome, burning green like what's good<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
God was in a good mood, on the day he made me<end_line>
I'm from the projects, it's the way it made me<end_line>
And I wouldn't change it for nothing<end_line>
I stay on point, that's 'cuz I know the danger of stuntin'<end_line>
But the aim is like I'll be at the ranges or somethin'<end_line>
It takes a gangsta, to know a gangsta<end_line>
That's why we look at you like a stranger or somethin'<end_line>
'Cuz we can tell by the body language you frontin'<end_line>
And it take a little more than lettin' ya pants sag<end_line>
Ya sand bag, tryna jump on the band wag<end_line>
I'll put the red dot on you like a Japan flag<end_line>
You need some high heels and a handbag<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I'm in the ten minutes to nine, leanin' on 'em<end_line>
Like I'm ten minutes behind, fuck a hundred shots<end_line>
Give me a .40 cal wit' ten in it, I'm fine<end_line>
Just spray, and shit'll get you ten minute of shine<end_line>
Keep a friend in it, that's ten cented for mine<end_line>
Keep the rims in it, that spin in it for mine<end_line>
Can't see him in it, I been tinted up mine<end_line>
But you know a nigga look oh so gangsta<end_line>
Oh no thank ya, I earned my key<end_line>
My name'll get you fucked up, and burners tee<end_line>
That's gangsta love, from the heart<end_line>
Yo I told y'all from the start<end_line>
And now<end_line>
Keep it G'd up, I can't slow down, these creep's speed up<end_line>
Cali bringin' peeps and weed up<end_line>
I'm coming through with a bunch of girls that'll deep a seed up<end_line>
<verse_end>
