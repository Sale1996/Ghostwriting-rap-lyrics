I assume I'm so into you<end_line>
Cause even before we hit the bedroom I was friends wit you<end_line>
If they ask, I ain't got to say "whom?" in them interviews<end_line>
My sweet thing never believe the rumors, that been ain't true<end_line>
The fact I had numerous friends is true<end_line>
But you was wifey, could change me to a groom in a minute boo<end_line>
Maybe, my sense of humor gets into you<end_line>
But girl, they could make a perfume from the scent of you<end_line>
I wanna take you where it feel like June and December too<end_line>
So what you think about Cancun 'til the winter boo?<end_line>
I don't know what the other consumers you been with do<end_line>
I put a day aside, to go to Bloomy's and spend with you<end_line>
Like any other man, I wanna zoom to the clinic too<end_line>
but I wanna see if me and my junior's identical<end_line>
A dude put a wound on the skin of you<end_line>
I swear to everything, that same afternoon, I'll be in the news<end_line>
feel me?<end_line>

Well this newcomer's known, to move with the seasons<end_line>
couple winter lodges, few summer homes<end_line>
I'm there for every "ooh", "um", and moan<end_line>
and make sure when the new Hummer roams, the shoes come in chrome<end_line>
I ain't new at buying white, yellow, and cucumber stones<end_line>
that send chills through a woman bones, but life gets gruesome alone, <end_line>
even though I got the kinda bread that won't matter if a few crumbs are blown<end_line>
flights, I done flew some alone, <end_line>
now I wanna wake up everyday with you in a new number zone<end_line>
Mama mia, it's you I'ma phone, <end_line>
just to erase all the negative views from your dome<end_line>
and I promise this fellas G, it's so gangsta it'll calm all that jealousy<end_line>
and drama you tellin me, so mama come yell at me<end_line>
so I can put the top down, and we can "Cruise/Cruz" like Tom and Penelope<end_line>
my charm is a felony.......<end_line>
