<verse_start>
It's not real, yeah...<end_line>
Look, the saddest story comes from those who once had the glory<end_line>
Had the foreigns, diamond watches and the baddest shorties<end_line>
Now they in their latter 40s, bunch of kids, scattered shorties<end_line>
No respect from the neglect, they call they daddy Corey<end_line>
I'm from a different cloth, that ain't the pattern for me<end_line>
There's levels to this shit, it's different categories<end_line>
Can't be like these niggas out here, lookin' fat and gaudy<end_line>
They ain't never won no rings, but be mad at Horry<end_line>
Talkin bout "Man that nigga don't deserve that shit"<end_line>
Like "I was really in these streets, I used to serve that shit"<end_line>
We started from the bottom, had to topsy-turn that shit<end_line>
Get it while the gettins' good, after that preserve that shit<end_line>
My ex texted me last night, but I curve that shit<end_line>
Coulda end up hittin' it, be too late to swerve that shit<end_line>
That's a young mistake, Lord knows I made me some<end_line>
I love gettin' brain, that never made me dumb<end_line>
All that did was made me cum, swear these hoes made me numb<end_line>
Only feelings for this bitch, you been shoulda gave me some<end_line>
I knew some niggas who had some bread never gave me crumbs<end_line>
Drink the whole fuckin' juice and never saved me some<end_line>
I know how young niggas feel, I had to live through shit<end_line>
See the world as constipated, nobody gon' give you shit<end_line>
I learned that niggas gon be niggas, yeah we shouldn't do it<end_line>
But hoes gon' be hoes, they just ain't admittin' to it<end_line>
Where I been? Gettin' to it, goin' through and gettin' through it<end_line>
Runnin' round killin' shit, tellin' cops, "I didn't do it"<end_line>
That's why they call me Young OG<end_line>
And I'ma spit this dope shit until my tongue OD<end_line>
I flew my shorty in from Cali and she brung OG<end_line>
She got me chillin' in my city but my lungs OT, yeah<end_line>
And fuck them niggas online, reply why<end_line>
Broke niggas talkin' cause it's free wifi<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Yeah, haha<end_line>
My son gon' be a king, I tell him every morning<end_line>
I put my chain on his neck, right now it's heavy on him<end_line>
One day it'll all be his, so I'm forever on him<end_line>
I test him all the time and I never warn him<end_line>
I pop quiz him like stop listenin' and drop wisdom<end_line>
Pops vision; the bottoms crowded, the top isn't<end_line>
We talk guap missions, cops prison<end_line>
I help him see it clearly, I'm his life optician<end_line>
Could learn from my experience but youngin' gotta live<end_line>
Cause not with that mentality then something gotta give<end_line>
Cause that's how we grew up, probably should of picked for boogers<end_line>
Nah we was on them streets, juggin for that mugger<end_line>
Still, scared that you could get killed<end_line>
That fear that you feel, was that real<end_line>
But I'm there like "I will not get killed"<end_line>
So that fear that I feel, is not real boy<end_line>
I'ma true king, tryna raise a new king<end_line>
I wanna show him stuff, teach how to do things<end_line>
How to ride a bike, how to tie shoe strings<end_line>
How to be a man, how to treat his boo thing<end_line>
Gotta have a OG, to give you that "Go 'head"<end_line>
I don't blame you niggas, I blame your old head<end_line>
I know all about that, my poppa wasn't down<end_line>
Poppa used to come through, poppa doesn't now<end_line>
Shoulda' protected me but poppa wasn't 'round<end_line>
So now I got this 9, that pop-a-dozen round<end_line>
Them kids grow up quick, usually grow you up too<end_line>
Turn you to a big dog, that's what havin' pups do<end_line>
Did a lot, but I know that I ain't done yet<end_line>
Before it goes down, I make sure that my son set/sunset<end_line>
You made so strong, you made this whole song<end_line>
You made me Young OG, love you Johan<end_line>
