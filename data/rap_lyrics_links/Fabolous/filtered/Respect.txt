Yea, I ain't scared of you motherfuckers<end_line>
I ain't no killer right<end_line>
But y'all niggaz gon' make me one<end_line>
For real.. leave me alone, shit<end_line>
You fuckin with the wrong one brotha<end_line>
I'm telling ya<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I'm sittin in the crib dreamin 'bout killin ya<end_line>
with machine guns shotties, desert Eag' dillingers<end_line>
putting a bullet as big as a battery through a niggas anatomy<end_line>
and watchin him die slow<end_line>
you need full clips to push up in the joint<end_line>
when you in the kinda truck that I push up to the joint<end_line>
cuz theses motherfuckas will push him to the point<end_line>
that you'll end up locked down doin push ups in the joint<end_line>
but they'll box you in the corner<end_line>
and you can throw ya fists up and act like you a boxer on his corner<end_line>
ride wit ya gun in your glove box instead of on ya<end_line>
you'll be six feet deep in one of them boxes if you wanna<end_line>
not me, I squeeze the clips drop from the handle<end_line>
till your remains is in a urn on top of the mantle<end_line>
till everybody scramble off the block like they Randall<end_line>
till there's a mural on your block and some candles<end_line>
who wanna die?<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
my teflons will have you screamin like Wyclef Jean <end_line>
but if they ever get the watch on my left arm<end_line>
ima have Marburythan that guy Stephon<end_line>
first, they put that white sheet over you brother<end_line>
then the newspapers put you all over the cover<end_line>
then you in a suit one hand cross over the other<end_line>
last you in the earth with the dirt over you brother<end_line>
a tinted hearse is what most men leave in<end_line>
followed by a limo full of family and close friends greavin<end_line>
one pull of marijuana<end_line>
ima wanna kill you as bad as The Terminator wanted Sarah Connor<end_line>
but, I'm loosin my patience<end_line>
fuck it, send me to the island I could use a vacation<end_line>
now it's easy for me to understand<end_line>
how you could just kill a man<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I'd rather be, <end_line>
judged by twelve than carried by the six<end_line>
My gun ain't on my man or carried by my chicks<end_line>
My gun ain't in my crib or carried in the six<end_line>
If I'm right here nigga then its right here nigga<end_line>
Picture me put in my hearse<end_line>
like I ain't gotta clip full of hollow tips to put in these jerks<end_line>
I might as well put in the work<end_line>
Spit 'em up outta here then get 'em up outta here<end_line>
I got the juice, like bishop had wit him<end_line>
That just don't give a fuck, semi<end_line>
Like ol' dog had wit him<end_line>
I'm sayin prayers for my enemy<end_line>
I hope god bless him, before the fucker run into me<end_line>
I dunno what the fuck has got into me<end_line>
But I know I don't want them slugs goin into me<end_line>
I'm just tryin to live my life<end_line>
So niggas better give me my respect or give me life<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Look what you made me do man<end_line>
Look what you made me do man<end_line>
I didn't want it to come to this, right<end_line>
But fuck it..<end_line>
Niggaz will push you to that point man<end_line>
Niggaz will play with you so fuckin much man<end_line>
Aggravate you so fuckin much man<end_line>
That you wanna kill a nigga man<end_line>
<verse_end>
