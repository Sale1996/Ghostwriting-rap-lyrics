Ain't no tellin' what this hypno' will do to me<end_line>
I'm feelin' like I can do what I want now<end_line>
Dip-low immunity<end_line>
Shorty! just shake your hips slow and move wit me<end_line>
Take a hit a this and sip slow and thoroughly<end_line>
You're sneakin' out on your man, tip-toein' to the V<end_line>
Cause I know you got him whipped though like wannabe<end_line>
Let's put on a live strip show just you and me<end_line>
But girl, I'm lookin' at them lips though like who is he?<end_line>
They ain't never seen a whip, clothes or jewelry<end_line>
So when I ask "you wanna leave the zip-code?"<end_line>
Say "sure" and be me<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
We gon' party, till we laid in graves<end_line>
Sweat out our doobie braids and waves<end_line>
Then scream "hey-hey-hey yo"<end_line>
That groupie made a wave<end_line>
Cause when she seen the whips and chains<end_line>
She started talking 'bout she ready to be made a slave, c'mon<end_line>
<verse_end>

All the glasses got liquid that blue in it over here<end_line>
Cigars got somethin' sticky that's glueing it over here<end_line>
Ladies movin' it over there, movin' it over here<end_line>
I can fit a few in a Rover's rear<end_line>
We havin' a good time, don't ruin it overs this<end_line>
You see why we asks is to see ID<end_line>
Cause girls will do anything for some VIP access<end_line>
Me I relax this<end_line>
Cause I'm used to ballin'<end_line>
You could tell that these guys need practice<end_line>
But if it was a problem then I would confront you<end_line>
You saying "no" but ya eyes say you want to<end_line>
But a pitcher that probably slugs, pitches and talk a put<end_line>
I ride wit the top down and switch to the top-up look<end_line>
Would you believe most these bitches go bop up shook<end_line>
Their asses pokin' out like them pictures in pop up books<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Oh yea! We's off the Richter Scale<end_line>
Hate will get you, put in coffins quick as hell<end_line>
If the ladies would show it off and thick as hell<end_line>
For my hustlers knockin' off them bricks as well<end_line>
And everybody, up north that's sick in jail<end_line>
I probably feel y'all, send you all of the flicks in mail<end_line>
The Street Family speed off in six SL's<end_line>
To all them chicks that yell "hey-hey-hey-hey yo"<end_line>
Shake your glasses back and forth to mix it well<end_line>
Shake your ass back and forth as quick as hell<end_line>
And just from lookin' at them thighs from the front view<end_line>
Girl I know that these guys say they want you<end_line>
If I wake up in the sand, clothes from yesterday<end_line>
Same hoes from yesterday <end_line>
Lightin' clips to the same dro' from yesterday<end_line>
Her hang-overs yesterday<end_line>
You ain't mistaken we in Benz's today<end_line>
But we had them Range Rovers yesterday<end_line>
<verse_end>
