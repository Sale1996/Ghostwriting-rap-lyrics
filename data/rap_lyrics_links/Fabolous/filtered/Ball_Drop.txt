"Well in just about 15 seconds from now, it'll be 1990<end_line>
We're gathered down below as we say goodbye to 1989<end_line>
The ball is moving, the crowd sees it, you can hear 'em - oh can you ever hear 'em<end_line>
They know when it hits the bottom it'll be 1990; goodbye to the 80s."<end_line>

This the New Year resolution<end_line>
We gotta be the winners cause the rest is losin'<end_line>
I told 'em get money, that's the best solution<end_line>
When you do, wear your +Rocket+ like you rest in Houston<end_line>
When niggas stole my style, I ain't stress the boostin'<end_line>
It's time to make more money, less excuses<end_line>
My old bitch on death row, it's time for execution<end_line>
My new bitch is +Bad Azz+, she the best since Boosie<end_line>

Cuttin' off hoes when the ball drop<end_line>
Ridin' with my woes 'til the casket drop<end_line>
Quiet 'fore you suckas hear a pin drop<end_line>
I buy this motherfucka like the price drop<end_line>
Shawty bag it up, let that ass drop<end_line>
Mommy killin' em, tat a tear drop<end_line>
Bitch I'm on fire, need to stop drop<end_line>
Nigga this the flow that got your artist dropped<end_line>
Heard he was a rat, heard he dime dropped<end_line>

Dollars comin' down like rain drops<end_line>
New year, new money, nigga ball drop<end_line>
