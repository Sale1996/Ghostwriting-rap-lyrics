Thinkin' 'bout Sent from my iPhone<end_line>
Left me for some light-skinned cat with a Mercedes<end_line>
Back then I didn't have no whip, had to upgrade me<end_line>
Now I got those white boy M's, she ain't as shady<end_line>
Well karma is a bitch baby<end_line>
Oh you wasn't tryna chill hoes?<end_line>
One day karma kicks you in the ass<end_line>
And I hope she wearin' steel toes<end_line>
Tried to have my head all twisted, won't let 'em braid me<end_line>
I just gotta be who I be, don't let it jade me<end_line>
Life gave me lemons, it's time to lemonade me<end_line>
Music to my ears, the lies just serenade me<end_line>
And what they done to me, I done done it to the next<end_line>
What goes around is comin' to you next<end_line>
I dress like I'ma run into my ex<end_line>
And every time I run into her flex, uh<end_line>

Your boy tried to fuck me over, thought we was homies<end_line>
Guess he was a h-o-e when I said homies<end_line>
Niggas get some money then act like they don't know me<end_line>
Got a new phone, cut off the old phonies<end_line>
They ain't never pick up for me when I used to call<end_line>
And they ain't never pass the 'Roc when they used to ball<end_line>
And they ain't never help me up when I used to fall<end_line>
Kept tryna do it big, fuck gettin' used to small<end_line>
After the success it's like yes they used to know me<end_line>
Now it ain't no 'Neneh nigga, I got Naomi<end_line>
Shoulda paid attention before you nigga owe me<end_line>
Since you down there on your knees, go ahead and blow me<end_line>
Suck a dick, tell a hater suck a dick<end_line>
Just a hood nigga that hit a fuckin' lick<end_line>
I keep my head up and I ain't never duckin' shit<end_line>
I'm self made, I don't owe a motherfucker shit, boy<end_line>
