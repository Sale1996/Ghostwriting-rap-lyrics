Uh, Uh, Uh<end_line>
Baby girl<end_line>
You know my situation<end_line>
And sometimes I know you get impatient<end_line>
But you don't put on a show to get ovations<end_line>
Take it to court and go through litagations<end_line>
And I respect you gangsta<end_line>
Treat you like a princess<end_line>
And put something on your neck to thank you<end_line>
She's my pinch hitter<end_line>
When the startin lineup ain't playin right<end_line>
I come off the bench with her<end_line>
It might sound like I'm gassin you<end_line>
But it take time to get from the back seat to the passenger<end_line>
We been creepin and sneakin<end_line>
Just to keep it from leakin<end_line>
We so deep in our freakin<end_line>
That we don't sleep on the weekend<end_line>
Wifey's a little bit uptight<end_line>
Wonderin why I keep coming home in the middle of the night<end_line>
It'll be alright if y'all bump heads it'll be a fight<end_line>
But I said it'll be alright<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
You ain't never step out of line<end_line>
Or get out a pocket<end_line>
So I made sure canary sent out your locket<end_line>
To protect you I'll get out and cock it<end_line>
And you know the barrel of my gun is big enough to spit out a rocket<end_line>
Oh, you gone play dumb if cops do come through<end_line>
I gotta keep the top up if my drop do come through<end_line>
But I know the boutiques and the shops you run through<end_line>
So I cop her one and cop you one too<end_line>
You always get a daily page weekly ring<end_line>
Plus you ain't too shy to do them freaky things<end_line>
I ain't gotta put a band on your finger<end_line>
Or worry about you tellin the whole world I'm your man while I spring her<end_line>
At first you was somethin I denied<end_line>
Something I would slide<end_line>
Just to do somethin in the ride<end_line>
But shorty, there's something you provide<end_line>
Cause the entre ain't as good without somethin on the side you know?<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Uh oh, I might be leavin the earth soon<end_line>
My girl gone kill me if she smells the scent of your perfume<end_line>
It's gonna be a clip tossed if I go back<end_line>
With stains of your lip gloss on my throwback<end_line>
She won't care if I'm a platinum rapper<end_line>
If she catch me with an empty Magnum wrapper<end_line>
So keep it on the down low call the car celly<end_line>
You seen what happened with Mr. Big and R Kelly uh<end_line>
<verse_end>
