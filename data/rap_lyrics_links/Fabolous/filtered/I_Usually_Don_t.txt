I beep my horn and they come to the car<end_line>
Damn right, they come to a stall<end_line>
That's right, it come with the car<end_line>
Now tell your boss, you cant come in tomorr<end_line>
My dro come by the jar<end_line>
They bring me drinks, why come by the bar?<end_line>
Nah nigga I ain't come here to spar<end_line>
These hallow tips will come where you are<end_line>
I stomp through smooth with the soldiers<end_line>
Two steppin and movin my shoulders<end_line>
Now the money's rollin in<end_line>
We got bottles lined up like bowlin pins<end_line>
Mami, you standin with a slouch<end_line>
Starin at me, while I'm standin on the couch<end_line>
Come and get in the blue flames<end_line>
Have a sip of this blue shit and lets rock!<end_line>

<verse_start>
Now.. Who's hot? Who's not?<end_line>
I can take the few shots you've got<end_line>
I can burn a few knots you've got<end_line>
I can blow the few spots you've got<end_line>
But, I chill, I will<end_line>
Get it to poppin whenever I feel<end_line>
I still shut it down<end_line>
And I white and yellow stud it down<end_line>
Watch them pretty girls strut it 'round<end_line>
Take the birdies and putt it down<end_line>
Like Tiger Woods did it, but I'm hood with it<end_line>
You've never seen a thug look as good with it<end_line>
And I promise that<end_line>
Fuck with me, you better move where 'sama's at<end_line>
You see I'm in here with the white ones on<end_line>
Tryin to get fucked up 'for the lights come on<end_line>
