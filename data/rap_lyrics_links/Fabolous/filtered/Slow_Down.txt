Yea, Slow down baby, let me be your yellow light<end_line>
The way we met was wrong, let me say hello right<end_line>
You need a mellow night, a break from this ghetto life<end_line>
The way I roll make them haters wanna yellow dice<end_line>
She say what matters is that you keep them stilettos nice<end_line>
And when you slap this ass, it shake like Jello, right?<end_line>
Well alright, roll them cigarellos tight<end_line>
I nicknamed her bape chicken and yellow rice<end_line>
Pretty brown skin, long blonde hair<end_line>
And she know they talking but she never gon' care<end_line>
Cause when you balling trash-talk is what you gon' hear<end_line>
I can't imagine what a fall upon LeBron's ear<end_line>
Always been the girl that didn't have to wait in line<end_line>
Niggas buy her watches just for making time<end_line>
Fake say "give it up" never had to ask<end_line>
They call her the stick up girl that never wore a mask<end_line>
Baby, ain't you tired of life in this fast lane?<end_line>
Packing luggage, rushing, trying to catch that last plane?<end_line>
There's some dudes who take pride in trying to gas dames<end_line>
The same dudes will see her and give they last name<end_line>
Funny how I became the apple of her eye<end_line>
The game went South and I'm a rapper from NY<end_line>
Don't get me wrong: lil mama love "Trap or Die"<end_line>
But through it all she kept her watch on the dapper guy<end_line>
And fell in love with a 2009 verse<end_line>
She said before we met, I fucked her in her mind first<end_line>
We crossed paths, a mixture of karma and luck<end_line>
I walked in strong, mentally palming my nuts<end_line>
I got em swarming and stuck, she calm in the cut<end_line>
You know me? I can spot a Swan from a Duck<end_line>
My approach? Smoother than an Armani tux<end_line>
The diamonds going off, like the alarm on a truck<end_line>
The small talk, warming her up, she palming her cup<end_line>
She told me that I make her laugh and I'm charming as fuck<end_line>
But for now she had to go, the chat just quickly changed<end_line>
She was chilling, now she leaving, I mean that was kinda strange<end_line>
Asked "can we meet again?" She said "that can be arranged"<end_line>
And I'm sure we both have phone numbers that can be exchanged<end_line>
We did, she slid, that'd a be explained<end_line>
But for now she hopped into a Platinum-colored Range<end_line>
