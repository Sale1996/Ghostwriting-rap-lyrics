They say a woman cancel dates 'cause she has to<end_line>
And a man cancel dates 'cause he has two<end_line>
Well I got two dates, one with destiny<end_line>
I need more baby don't think any less of me<end_line>
Tryin to juggle, slowly became a struggle<end_line>
Sometime I wanna hug the block sometime I wanna hug you<end_line>
Sometime it's 'bout the check, sometime it's 'bout checkin that<end_line>
Dinero said you gotta leave in thirty seconds flat<end_line>
When the heat's comin even if you meet someone<end_line>
Leave it in the rear view don't look back keep runnin<end_line>
Left her in the passenger, with the jeep runnin<end_line>
Hazard lights blinkin and the beat bumpin<end_line>
Ear to the streets I hear the sweeps comin<end_line>
Ear to yo' chest so I hear a beat from it<end_line>
She fell in love with a street nigga<end_line>
Tattoo my name on her petite figure<end_line>

There's always money to be made that you can't deny<end_line>
I always made mine never one who can't decide<end_line>
I'm only human so if I don't eat I can't survive<end_line>
And mama said your not a man if you can't provide<end_line>
The son must know a shortcut it beats me whole<end_line>
I work so hard to get here now it keep me gone<end_line>
By the time I get in what she made to eat be old<end_line>
When I slide in bed she complain my feet be cold<end_line>
'Caught up in the street life just like my bitch said<end_line>
I love the game I love the hustle just like Mitch said<end_line>
Yeah I could leave the game, but is they still 'gon love me?!<end_line>
And when that new nigga come, they 'gon stop thinkin of me<end_line>
Shorty watch the hustler movie she can never get<end_line>
How they make so much money, but they never quit<end_line>
I tell her quit for what that's the only life they know<end_line>
The streets a dirty hoe, niggas try to wife it though<end_line>
