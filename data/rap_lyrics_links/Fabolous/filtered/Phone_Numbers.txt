I'm having doubts, what they really believe<end_line>
Starting with these Stefan Urquelle, who really be Steve<end_line>
Photoshop dont make it better, it really deceive<end_line>
Long hair dont care, but it really be weave<end_line>
Lets get back to this real shit<end_line>
That life, I'm bout<end_line>
Anytime that I'm out, I keep ballin like there's no time out<end_line>
On the kush I'm stoned out<end_line>
On you haters, I zone out<end_line>
Y'all opinions dont make me money<end_line>
So what yall thinkin dont count<end_line>
I mean the nerve of these niggas giving me attitude<end_line>
When I be serving these niggas<end_line>
You rappers platter food<end_line>

Saying they overrated is a understatement<end_line>
Them niggas is broke, look like they under maintanence<end_line>
They rapping bout mansions, but from they momma's basement<end_line>
Swear they in phantoms, but drive a honda station<end_line>
Lets get back to this real shit<end_line>
Stay away from that counterfeit<end_line>
That fake-it till you make-it life, really dont amount to shit<end_line>
Talkin never bothers us, sometimes it do bore me<end_line>
So if ya makin movies, hope it based on a true story<end_line>
Freck said "nothings worse than a rich hater"<end_line>
When money call, pick it up n call that bitch later<end_line>
