<verse_start>
I feel like the ex-champ back in the title fight<end_line>
The young contenders are lookin at me in idol light<end_line>
Fresh taper, waves lookin tidal tight<end_line>
Yea I'm in the building, like a Corey Lidal flight<end_line>
I'm married to the streets, this is my recital right<end_line>
I got the Phantom drop dressed up bridal white<end_line>
Hehe, you know them doors are suicidal right?<end_line>
Sorta like they slit your wrists when I'm tryin to sit your miss<end_line>
Nigga picture this, like a Kodak moment<end_line>
I'm off the bullshit, 'bout to go back on it<end_line>
And I ain't hard to find, bet ya Lojack on it<end_line>
Call it corn row roof, cause it go back don't it?<end_line>
I gotta get it now, ain't no pinchin plan rappin<end_line>
Fuck bein friends, save me the hand dappin<end_line>
Understand captain, you'll be under land nappin<end_line>
If you keep thinkin that it can't when it can happen<end_line>
Ask Scarface, faster than a car chase<end_line>
At ya grandma's place, lettin AR's waste<end_line>
Sports Coupe, not too much car space<end_line>
The trunk look like Desperados guitar case<end_line>
If you say a thing wrong, I won't let it string long<end_line>
All I gotta do is push the button like ding-dong<end_line>
I don't play the back and forth game 'less it's ping-pong<end_line>
Mike Tyson flow, so I ain't in the ring long<end_line>
Nigga you ain't King Kong, thinkin that you bit shit<end_line>
You gon have your man sick, someone sing his theme song<end_line>
My nigga Freck plugged me in with this Beijing joint<end_line>
So hot, she play Alaskan with a string thong<end_line>
Real delicate, I just call her China Set<end_line>
Fendi fur, Gucci gators, guess she like designer pets<end_line>
She saw a few things, that get her vagina wet<end_line>
SF, G4, and it's not a niners jet<end_line>
But check the body drop, baby boy shittin<end_line>
But it's just sittin, so it's like I made a potty stop<end_line>
It's like karate chops, we be breakin bricks down<end_line>
Cocaine tour, I been through six towns<end_line>
Open with crack as the openin act<end_line>
Heroin headliner, stage name China<end_line>
That's what you call a trap star<end_line>
I could get the kingpin charged for these rap bars<end_line>
