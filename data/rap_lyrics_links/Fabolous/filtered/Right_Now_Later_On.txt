Some little pretty mami's is all I need<end_line>
Hennessy, Cristal and sticky weed<end_line>
A little drop sports coupe's all I want<end_line>
And I brought the hammer if y'all front<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Yeah, the kid been makin these mami's, yell "papacita"<end_line>
Since Kangols and shell-top Adidas<end_line>
Love when te-ta's look like they'll pop through beaters<end_line>
And the hips won't fit in the L-drop two-seater<end_line>
But ma' I ain't the type to love ya<end_line>
I'm a triflin, good for nothin, type a brother<end_line>
This cute face'll make your wife smile<end_line>
And I check in two bags and one's just a suitcase full of Lifestyles<end_line>
And we both rent out playa<end_line>
Difference is you a sweet subsitute, I'm a Penthouse playa<end_line>
Y'all seen my rings borders<end_line>
It's full of queen and king's daughters, as clean as spring water<end_line>
'F's for freakin, 'A's alright<end_line>
'B's for bottles that pop all night<end_line>
'O's for the ounces that I got<end_line>
That we blow everday, know why, why not, nigga?<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
It's the hoodrat Hugh Hefner, that bend dimes, too<end_line>
The five plus one, sittin on ten times two<end_line>
Shorty when I'm through....<end_line>
I'm a know if you nice on the mic and if your friend rhyme, too<end_line>
It's so funny how I suit the women<end_line>
They know I'm still spendin show money from "Superwoman"<end_line>
They like "where'd he get those twenties?"<end_line>
And "I didn't know that's a color that the coupe could come in, damnit man"<end_line>
All I say to the heffers is "Jesus"<end_line>
Keep swallowin my kids, might as well have no nephews and nieces<end_line>
I know you wanna sip Proof<end_line>
And try an make me crack a smile, just so you can see my chipped tooth<end_line>
I'm tryna' get you, in and out of my room<end_line>
Just to get, in and out of your womb<end_line>
And the rocks in mine glare, somethin like Times Square<end_line>
Excuse me miss, you want me to sign where?<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Fab's hard to be found<end_line>
But most likely I'm with a foreign dame who name's hard to pronounce<end_line>
I started out, gettin hard by the ounce<end_line>
No more cash in stashes, it's cards in accounts<end_line>
The way I make 'em nod to the bounce<end_line>
Somebody call Silvia and tell her ship larger amounts<end_line>
This playa make 'em scream a scheme<end_line>
My closest look like I keep gettin traded from team to team<end_line>
Look sleezy, it's difficult<end_line>
but me and Tim the only ones that make pimpin look easy<end_line>
Tell me how I'm gonna make my album cleaner<end_line>
With bitches suckin me up like vacuum cleaners<end_line>
Even chickens wanna cluck outside<end_line>
And mami can't stop eyein<end_line>
And when I said my rims was only nineteens, she said "stop lyin!"<end_line>
<verse_end>
