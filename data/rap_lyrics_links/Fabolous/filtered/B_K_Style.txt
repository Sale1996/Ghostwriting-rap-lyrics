Goin to war is still a scary issue<end_line>
But in my hood they train to kill wit every pistol<end_line>
Like they military issue<end_line>
Guess you a star if you sell a million every disc two<end_line>
Catch a gun case and bounce and still they'll barely frisk you<end_line>
Cuz, I proved I move the retail<end_line>
Make the smoothest grooves wit female<end_line>
And I remove the rules on V12's<end_line>
You aint never seen it move this smooth on sprewell's<end_line>
I'm a hustler, you just a middle man to me<end_line>
The way I pass the rock could make Jason Kidd a fan of me<end_line>
Just cop one joint, I'm a one point somethin<end_line>
Still I'll have you at gunpoint, with one joint dumpin<end_line>
So watch what you say to them crackers<end_line>
Ill put a couple G's on yer head like you play for the Packers<end_line>
I'm rap's Labron James, I quickly see baskets<end_line>
These scrubs wouldn't make it to the Mickey-D's classics<end_line>
You got some sticky weed? Pass it<end_line>
If not put it out, im pushin it before they put it out<end_line>
Wit the dash, wooded out, Shaq O'Neal footed out<end_line>
Blastin aget it first, before they put it out, Clue!<end_line>

<verse_start>
Maybe wouldn't be a million kids wit they faces on containers<end_line>
If cops pursue the same way they chase us entertainers<end_line>
In the hood, a few big faces and a chain a-<end_line>
Get metal in ya mouth like braces and retainers<end_line>
Even the young bucks be scheming on somebody change<end_line>
Tryin a sell somebody 'cain, before they even potty trained<end_line>
You can smooth talk your way into a hottie brain<end_line>
Have her suckin long enough to leave a nigga body drained<end_line>
I wasn't taught, I learned from watchin stupid people<end_line>
That'll run up shootin, in front of a group of people<end_line>
I lay in a cut, the same way the troopers peep you<end_line>
Ride up on yer coupe and creep you while you let a groupie deep you<end_line>
Cuz even if you reppin like a man of skill<end_line>
You gon' still need a weapon when you layin a deal<end_line>
One for watch you slippin like you steppin banana pills<end_line>
Think a nigga ain't gon' pull a weapon cuz you scanned a mil?<end_line>
I crept in and got handed meals<end_line>
Now the white and black rides look like salt and pepper on the bannon grill<end_line>
Think I wouldn't hold a Pepsi in my hand for mils?<end_line>
You must be fuckin stupid, nigga<end_line>
