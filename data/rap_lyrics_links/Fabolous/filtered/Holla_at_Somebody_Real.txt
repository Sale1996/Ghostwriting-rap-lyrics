You need to holla at somebody real, such as myself<end_line>
Won't nobody do as much as myself<end_line>
And it's so real, I hop out and get the Duchess myself<end_line>
For a pretty girl such as yourself<end_line>
Cuz I'm a busy man and don't see too much for myself<end_line>
and sometimes it be hard to get in touch with myself<end_line>
But I, make the time when I have to<end_line>
Learn to take my time and be careful when dealin'<end_line>
With women there's some who be wheelin' and schemin'<end_line>
And dive in to relationships cuz I got a million to swim in<end_line>
They'll throw it to you faster than Schilling and Clemens<end_line>
But feelings ain't the only thing that you can catch now<end_line>
Some do lawyers that you hopin' ?they fed styles?<end_line>
Others pass diseases that you could catch now<end_line>
But in my minutes alone I think about this crazy world<end_line>
And don't wanna live in it alone cuz<end_line>

<verse_start>
I'm searchin' for real love like J. Blige in '92<end_line>
But I pray I would find you<end_line>
They say weather the storm and leave the gray skies behind you<end_line>
The fake may try to blind you<end_line>
That's why I stay fly like I do<end_line>
And no I can't trust everybody that I say "Hi" and "Bye" to<end_line>
First I need a girl that may die as my boo<end_line>
Then I may try the "I Do's", but I refuse<end_line>
to be tricked or used by a chick<end_line>
who get amusement and kicks out abusing my dick<end_line>
When it's real I'm all in it<end_line>
But I don't want the scars of love that you get when you fall in it<end_line>
Before it didn't matter who<end_line>
Now I look for some with a little attitude<end_line>
I could chill to chatter to, good looking but witty and compatible<end_line>
Long hair with a fatty too, and that'll do<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I need to holla at somebody real, could that be you<end_line>
The feelings that I feel, could that be true<end_line>
Most cats lay where the hood rats beat boo<end_line>
But I'm the kinda cat that strays away<end_line>
That's till somebody real sways my way<end_line>
Then I might spend some days away, on an Asia Bay<end_line>
Eatin' food made the Cajun way, and sippin' a little sake<end_line>
Boilin' a little broccoli<end_line>
But this world is full of floozies that bullshit usually<end_line>
I pull them choosy<end_line>
Cuz on this joint, and at this point<end_line>
I know I have to holla at somebody real, for real<end_line>
<verse_end>
