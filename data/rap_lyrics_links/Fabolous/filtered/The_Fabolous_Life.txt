<verse_start>
Let me welcome you to my world<end_line>
Everything's "In Living Color" plus the fly girls<end_line>
On the way in gotta watch 'em with a keen eye<end_line>
Niggaz ain't seen fly 'til they seen I<end_line>
Maybach 'cause I'm not a limousine guy<end_line>
Suit with the bow tie, no bean pies<end_line>
The Lapels match well with these Ferragamies<end_line>
Killer shoe game, these are just a pair of Hummie's<end_line>
Mami, I get up like QB's<end_line>
Nah, she ain't stepped in blood, those are Lou B's<end_line>
We don't follow, unless you lead us into VIP<end_line>
When they know your face, they don't need to see ID<end_line>
I can see the bottles comin from a mile away<end_line>
Sparklers on the top, act like they don't want to stop<end_line>
She fuck with niggaz like Fabolous<end_line>
'Cause to tell the truth baby, life's fabulous<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I bow my head and I praise that<end_line>
We be there and back before the Rosey's flat<end_line>
Picture me anywhere a clown stays at<end_line>
I don't think so, homey don't play that<end_line>
Everything is "boss", like a Rick ad, lib<end_line>
+Take It To Da House+ like it's Trick Dad', crib<end_line>
We hit Miami like a Hurricane<end_line>
Shorty poolside, one piece Vera Wang<end_line>
She the baddest bitch in them Jackie O shades<end_line>
Floppy beach hat, she don't give me no shade<end_line>
Hold the +Heat+ down, she don't even know Wade<end_line>
Nigga get smoked like cigarette totes<end_line>
I like a soft kiss and I dig a wet throat<end_line>
I love when booty bounce like cigarette boats<end_line>
And it won't quit<end_line>
She can't wear skinny jeans 'cause her ass don't fit<end_line>
Real shit<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Got a rich bitch on the way<end_line>
That for real though, just like Wanda say<end_line>
She just wanna rock my world in a Wanda way<end_line>
I'm sitting at the airport like andele<end_line>
First I saw the luggie with the Louis monogram<end_line>
Then I saw my baby like a sonogram<end_line>
On the runway, just me and Bentley<end_line>
I open doors, you ain't gotta "G To Gent" me<end_line>
I was thinkin Knick game, courtside<end_line>
She put her hand in my pants, I let that thought slide<end_line>
We can get it on but there's no leg room<end_line>
No water bed, just a boat with a bedroom<end_line>
Now you tell me what can top this?<end_line>
Layin on a deck topless<end_line>
Got two different tans, it's a fabulous thing<end_line>
One white, one yellow, like Fabolous chain<end_line>
<verse_end>
