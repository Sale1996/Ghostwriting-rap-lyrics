Met her up town on Dykeman, aight then, light skinned<end_line>
Starin with a slight grin, I don't know, might been<end_line>
'Cause I'm in this white Benz<end_line>
Or the way the ice in the Breitling, flash brighter than the lightning<end_line>
But I knew from right then<end_line>
She was 'bout her money and how she fit right in<end_line>
Knowin how I might spend<end_line>
To make a story short, other than the tight end<end_line>
Had a Washington Heights friend, who bring that white in<end_line>
Set up a meeting, her dude caught a flight in<end_line>
Sat down at Sole, popped a bottle of white then<end_line>
Got straight to business like two corporate white men<end_line>
The food came, before I could take a bite in<end_line>
He said "you the type I usually don't invite in<end_line>
But since we got a like friend, I could get you like ten"<end_line>
I told him I could move like ten by night's end<end_line>
Put the white over the plate like I'm throwin strikes in<end_line>
El Duque, got a dude in the UK, buy five bricks at a time, 22K<end_line>
He send the Euros, I send the pure dough<end_line>
Now that's the real meaning of a foreign exchange<end_line>
He smiled, then finished his glass of wine<end_line>
There's a van outside, pull your S-Class behind<end_line>
My man'll pass a dime, at one five a pop<end_line>
Tell shorty "make the drop, don't make no stops"<end_line>
I gave him a hand shake, some dollars for the tab<end_line>
Gave shorty the location then I hollered for a cab<end_line>
I hit Mike told 'em "send the wire to the buyers"<end_line>
Word got 'round like we was passin out flyers<end_line>
And them things went as quick as they came<end_line>
I'm back bein a hustler, this chick is to blame<end_line>
I said them things went as quick as they came<end_line>
I'm back bein a hustler, this chick is to blame<end_line>

<verse_start>
Twelve months in, turned a Benz to a Lambo<end_line>
Everywhere the fam go, corks fly, cham' flow<end_line>
I gotta celebrate, that's the way I am yo<end_line>
In the past week I watched fifty thousand grams go<end_line>
Pocket full of money, army full of Rambos<end_line>
Trunk full of bricks, hand guns full of ammo<end_line>
Even got detectives if somethin goes wrong<end_line>
The money's so strong, they see it from my perspective<end_line>
But with my shorty, a nigga so protective<end_line>
And should be, she the one who know where the connect live<end_line>
She don't talk much, real calm and collective<end_line>
Seen somethin in me 'cause shorty's very selective<end_line>
I tell her fall back, shorty still'll drive<end_line>
She said the rush of the risk just make her feel alive<end_line>
I listen at her fuss, sayin that I must<end_line>
Let her do it 'cause it ain't too many niggaz that I trust<end_line>
So now time is flyin, I've been kind of eyein<end_line>
A ring for my queen, who got me diamond buyin<end_line>
I'm in the G.T., headed up to CT<end_line>
Lookin for a stone, light her finger like E.T.<end_line>
I got there, got a call from a DT<end_line>
Sounded nervoussayin "we need to talk now"<end_line>
I told 'em "chill out, I ain't in New York now<end_line>
Any problems I got, get traced in chalk now<end_line>
But when I get back, we can meet and chit chat<end_line>
Better not be no bullshit, I ain't even with that"<end_line>
Now back to what a nigga came out here for<end_line>
This five carat diamond without near flaw<end_line>
Then head back to the city, call up the committee<end_line>
Get ready for tomorrow, they comin in with fifty<end_line>
I almost forgot, I gotta stop and see a cop<end_line>
I figured it was a drop, who must ain't get his gwap<end_line>
Told 'em meet me by the bridge, I get there in a hurry<end_line>
Got me worried and it's probably just a minor mix up<end_line>
He said "nah Los', Feds done snatched ya chick up<end_line>
Caught her at a pick up, scoopin them bricks up<end_line>
She gon' cooperate and a fix up<end_line>
Probably at the headquarters now hangin flicks up"<end_line>
I asked him "Was he sure?" Shorty's mi amor<end_line>
This happened to me before with my man Diador, over a ki of raw<end_line>
My nigga got killed, caps got peeled and I still got guilt<end_line>
He assured me, I was hot, she had put 'em on me<end_line>
Swore to Jesus' peers that he was here to warn me<end_line>
Normally, I would have just ended her life<end_line>
But this was the girl that I intended to wife<end_line>
So I went home to shorty, had trouble sleepin<end_line>
Shorty kind of peepin, my sudden discomfort<end_line>
She woke up mad early, so I got up with her<end_line>
Got dressed and told her I would hit the spot up with her<end_line>
She wanted to go alone but a nigga insisted<end_line>
Like "baby it's been a while and truthfully I missed it"<end_line>
We rode out but she don't know that I done made a plan<end_line>
When she hit the spot, close shot, see you later man<end_line>
I watched her in the building<end_line>
Knowin it's the last time, seein her ass climb in and out of the car<end_line>
Yo I even thought about gettin out of the car<end_line>
But sat back, lookin at the ring about to be yours<end_line>
I let one tear fall at an unfair call<end_line>
Ya whole life can change in just one year y'all<end_line>
Caught in a thought, then I heard a<end_line>
Hi love, bye love, I will miss my love<end_line>
