I wonder briefly<end_line>
Could it be there's no roof above me<end_line>
or the 22's underneath me<end_line>
Thats keepin them sirens flashin on my ass<end_line>
Should I get to pumpin the brakes or mashin on the gas?<end_line>
I'm naturally harassed<end_line>
And I feel like I'm getting punked... but I don't see Ashton in the grass<end_line>
Nor is there a camera stashed into the dash<end_line>
It's a guy in a uniform and a passion that he has<end_line>
For flashin wit his badge<end_line>
And shining light in my face<end_line>
Plus he keep his right hand right by his waist<end_line>
The wrong move will get a gun right in my face<end_line>
And they fighting for my life... I'm fighting the case<end_line>
And I ain't trying to be the story they twist in the press<end_line>
Like: the young man resisted arrest<end_line>
Then he started reaching for something that looks like a pistol I guess<end_line>
So I pulled on a nigga I mean I pulled on the trigger...figures<end_line>

<verse_start>
They gon' have to put my back on the cement<end_line>
Before I'm in the back with my knee bent<end_line>
On my way back to the precinct<end_line>
I'm back in the G-bent<end_line>
Black wit the pre-tint<end_line>
Vanilla aroma to cover the back with the tree scent<end_line>
The way I ride I know I'm in for a case<end_line>
But the coupe do 200 so they in for a chase<end_line>
When it comes to lawyers I got the man Puff uses<end_line>
Thats why you never seen my wrists with handcuff bruises<end_line>
I got them hollow tips.. to stick up in the AR's<end_line>
Detectors in the dash.. to pick up on the radar<end_line>
Stash box in it when I purchased the vehicle<end_line>
So I don't have a problem wit you searching the vehicle<end_line>
They probably want to scoop an arrest<end_line>
I try to throw shots but its cool, I got a coupe like a vest<end_line>
And 'em troopers will just feel stupid I guess<end_line>
The slugs will bounce off like they hittin superman's chest.. nigga<end_line>
