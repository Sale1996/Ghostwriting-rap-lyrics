You're the one baby girl, I've never been so sure<end_line>
Your skin's so pure, the type men go for<end_line>
The type I drive the Benz slow for<end_line>
The type I be beepin the horn, rollin down the windows for<end_line>
Never been no whore<end_line>
So to get you in closed doors, I buy you everything in those stores<end_line>
This, that, and those yours<end_line>
As long as Fabolous the only one you let that grin show for<end_line>
You ain't gotta spend no more, I'm a put a rock on your hand<end_line>
You ain't gotta say "we just friends" no more<end_line>
I shine, you shine, it never been no flaws<end_line>
I ain't like most who just wanna get in those drawers<end_line>
'Cause every king need a queen<end_line>
And with me and you girl I ain't tryna let a thing in between<end_line>
It ain't a thing, nahmean, chicks hate, show 'em the ring and the green<end_line>
And let your middle finger be seen, it's on<end_line>

Uh, don't front ma', you know the way I ball's to pick and roll<end_line>
Like Stockton and Malone when we play the mall<end_line>
I be goin out my way to call<end_line>
'Cause I love the way your hips make your jeans seem like they too small<end_line>
Them see-through tops with your titties exposed<end_line>
When you kick off them shoes there ain't bitty whose toes as pretty as those<end_line>
That blonde hair look good, straight down, bun or the braids<end_line>
And I ain't gon' talk about them light-browns under your shades<end_line>
Bust right, thus tight<end_line>
Got a thick set of thighs and struts like......uh<end_line>
Yo' the game taught this brother to mack<end_line>
But I think I slipped when I saw them full lips covered with Mac<end_line>
You got everything that others would lack<end_line>
Along with the F-A, B-O, L-O, U-S<end_line>
Your patience I personally admire<end_line>
'Cause I started out a player now I'm 'bout to have my jersey retired, for real<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
There ain't no "mights" or "maybe"<end_line>
I done did wrong, so I'm a make sure it's right for my baby<end_line>
You know how tight that my day be<end_line>
And how long and stressin them flights to L.A. be<end_line>
Ain't no rumor gon' get back to your friends<end_line>
Before I let a nigga disrespect you I be back in the pen<end_line>
Front to back you a ten<end_line>
You got me thinkin 'bout puttin a car seat in back of the Benz, uh<end_line>
<verse_end>
