<verse_start>
I'm always close to..<end_line>
feeling like a corner stander, stoop sitter, or hallway post-er<end_line>
No matter where I go it's always 'posed to, feel just like I'm<end_line>
Cops drive in it every 5 minutes, look at your faces, pat your waists'<end_line>
Try to find the stash where the gats and base is, I can't say that they racist<end_line>
But I know.. it ain't the same in they town<end_line>
And as fucked up as it may sound<end_line>
it's 2 ways to make it happen off the streets<end_line>
Balling on the courts or rapping off the beats<end_line>
You hear the shells tappin' off the 'crete, when they clappin' off the heat<end_line>
Then the yellow tape's trappin off the street<end_line>
But that's the way we was raised<end_line>
Preying to God, hoping that he keep us out the way of them strays<end_line>

They drink 'til the cups dry, eat 'til the plate's clean<end_line>
Niggaz be in state greens 'fore they turn 18<end_line>
'Round here you never let the beef slide twice<end_line>
Everybody raised on 4 wings and beef fried rice<end_line>
Them mothers are getting younger today<end_line>
Got one by the hand, one in the stroller and one on the way<end_line>
We don't have role models<end_line>
But we got them handguns that hold hollows<end_line>
Ain't no diplomas or degrees<end_line>
but you can get high from the aroma of the trees<end_line>
I know it like navigation, and fuck having patience<end_line>
I'ma get mine, you better get yours, cuz everyday is a struggle<end_line>
And One-Time ride through everyday just to bug you<end_line>
That's how it is, cuz your rights be wrong<end_line>
And everybody got a white T on, when you're in..my..hood<end_line>
