Yo, I ain't got no reason to trick or spend<end_line>
Mami, I'm the reason the chicks begin cheesein' and snickerin'<end_line>
Playa like me? every season these chicks have been<end_line>
Talkin' how I came through the P's in a sicker Benz<end_line>
Heard about the platinum visas the bricker bends<end_line>
Jewels so icey I need freezers to sitck 'em in<end_line>
I be's in the keys wit a click of friends<end_line>
Trees and a liquor blend, I be too queezy and sick to grin<end_line>
I dont care if a skeezer is thick or thin<end_line>
It's gon' look like she havin' a seizure I stick it in<end_line>
Skeos say "can I get the keys to ya six again?"<end_line>
After I nut, that's when amnesia be kickin' in<end_line>
Most broads I done met, ain't see a guy <end_line>
Who spend a G on gucci T's, five for sweats<end_line>
I'm what chicks strive to get, I stay in the P.J's<end_line>
You thinkini'm talkin' pivate jets, uh<end_line>

<verse_start>
So the kid never stresses a female<end_line>
And if you ask where I live they gon' give you<end_line>
addresses to e-mail<end_line>
All that cops can suggest is that he sell<end_line>
How I'm gon' push it unless it's a v-12<end_line>
From S's to CL's, I request is<end_line>
In the head rests his t.v's dwell<end_line>
They heard how many albums I presses for retail<end_line>
And they can't get a dime unless it's a weed sale<end_line>
And lets be real, catch me at the bar wit them crispy bills <end_line>
Gettin Cris' re-fills, my wrist be chilled<end_line>
And my wardrobe look like I got an Ice Berg History deal<end_line>
Still dames have been givin me slow neck<end_line>
And I don't even know what they real names have been<end_line>
I feel ashamed to spend, 'cause when it comes to knockin' 'em down<end_line>
I'm right behind Wilt Chamberlin<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Ma you musta had too many weed totes<end_line>
'Cause I ain't givin' you any C-notes <end_line>
I'm all about floatin' on them new skinny speed boats<end_line>
Hundred and somthin wit two skinny deep throats<end_line>
Winter hit, I'm in a new finny ski coat<end_line>
See the screens? ain't gotta use any remotes<end_line>
No more shoppin' sprees I'm rough wit the ends<end_line>
Keep honeys on their knees, scuffin' they shins<end_line>
I deal wit nothin but tens<end_line>
I be the club king wit diamonds shuffling your friends<end_line>
Chickens get keys, scuffin the Benz<end_line>
Cause they wanna lock me down like I'm Puff in the pens<end_line>
Snatch any chink blond who feel my link longview<end_line>
I ain't tryin to put clinks on you<end_line>
Hope trickin ain'n one of the things you think John do<end_line>
Cause thats the way you end up wit a drink on you mami<end_line>
<verse_end>
