I can't deny it, you's a dick rider<end_line>
You can never flow like me, blow like me<end_line>
Why would a bitch like ya?<end_line>
She can see that I'm a fuckin rider, you a hitch hiker<end_line>
I'm walkin in some shoes, they can't make fit ya<end_line>
Got millions of paper that you can't take with ya<end_line>
I don't wanna talk and I can't take pictures<end_line>
Listen to your demo, I'll handshake with ya<end_line>
Excuse you, who's you?<end_line>
If I need a stunt double I'll use you<end_line>
Pardon y'all, I don't wanna step on y'all toes<end_line>
Seperate the authentic from the replica flows<end_line>
And the kid be places you could never be at<end_line>
So that can never be this, and this can never be that<end_line>
These niggaz got some audacity<end_line>
Sell some records as fast as me<end_line>
Or sell some tickets out as fast as me<end_line>

None of these wannabes really come close<end_line>
I feel like I'm watchin the MTV show Christina Milian hosts<end_line>
Everybody know this brother got it<end_line>
Way before everybody and their mother got it<end_line>
They still wonder how he sound like he do<end_line>
If I was you, I'd wanna sound like me too<end_line>
'Cause I got M's, they got G's and they all right<end_line>
But they not me<end_line>
They hear how I spit it on a station<end_line>
Now they wanna put me on they singles just to get an imitation<end_line>
No, I can't make an appearance<end_line>
Give you a cheap fee or break on a clearance<end_line>
I'm what your label hoped it could be<end_line>
That's why they trying to mould your little ass, into a sculpture of me<end_line>
With the ladies it'll be like leader, she like real<end_line>
Y'all trying to be like me and be like ill<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I'm real<end_line>
It's the way I talk, the way I walk<end_line>
It ain't my fault<end_line>
I won't let nothin' on two legs stop me<end_line>
'Cause the real is always better than the bootleg copy<end_line>
Like I ain't show 'em the white and yellows at the same time<end_line>
Throw backs and pin wheels at the same time<end_line>
Like I'm scared to drop at the same time<end_line>
I'll show you how to do this young'n<end_line>
I ain't frontin'<end_line>
These Jordan's ain't comin'<end_line>
It ain't nothin'<end_line>
Keep the complaints comin'<end_line>
Can't hop on my bandwagon<end_line>
Jump in my blue flames<end_line>
You should not try, you are not I<end_line>
It's the dude with the Grammy grin<end_line>
It's no relation if it ain't a street family kin<end_line>
So won't the real Fabolous please stand up<end_line>
Please stand up<end_line>
Please stand up<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
So all that y'all can do is hate it<end_line>
<verse_end>
