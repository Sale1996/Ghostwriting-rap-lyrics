Hey yo ain't nuttin changed but the leaves on the trees<end_line>
And y'all comin short like the sleeves on the tees<end_line>
The money long here like a weave to your knees<end_line>
So I don't just stunt man, I leave with the breeze<end_line>
And I don't just front man, I back it up<end_line>
I'm so cool you might wanna zip your jacket up<end_line>
I breeze through, bullshit, I sees through<end_line>
with the snub nosed three-eight, bullets just squeeze through<end_line>
Chah, and he's through, just like autumn<end_line>
When niggaz slip and they fall, guess who caught 'em?<end_line>
Fuck it~! Kill 'em all, let God sort 'em<end_line>
Next year Gucci shoe, yeah I sport 'em<end_line>
And I would tell you where I bought 'em<end_line>
But they ain't from here and they might be<end_line>
So fall back like the seats in the back<end_line>
Niggaz late, take your seats in the back, church<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
And ain't nuttin up but the top on the Coupe<end_line>
The pockets are fat man that's guap' with a scoop<end_line>
Got Three Little Women like a pop singin group<end_line>
I make my point, the ball drop through the hoop<end_line>
They on my joint, that's how I roll up with the paper<end_line>
Under the wing niggaz just fold up like the paper<end_line>
You gon' make me put you in a headline<end_line>
And your girl gon' help me come up with a hair line<end_line>
The suck game while I'm drivin is a fool<end_line>
She know it's head first like she divin in a pool<end_line>
Right stroke, left stroke was the best stroke<end_line>
Bitch blow whistle like she had a ref's throat<end_line>
Foul! And that's so flagrant<end_line>
Aim at your neck and I spray that fragrance<end_line>
I'm wear the chrome like cologne<end_line>
Smell me? Nothin you can tell me - gone!<end_line>
