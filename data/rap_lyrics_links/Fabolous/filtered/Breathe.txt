You niggaz can't share my air <end_line>
Or walk a mile in the pair I wear <end_line>
And I'm gettin better year by year <end_line>
Like they say wine do <end_line>
Cops couldn't smell me if you brought the canines through <end_line>
And I pace myself <end_line>
I know these money hungry bitches wanna taste my wealth <end_line>
But I keep em' on a diet <end_line>
Embrace they health <end_line>
Or either keep em' on a quiet <end_line>
And space myself <end_line>
And just take a deep breath <end_line>
I got em' grabbin' they chest <end_line>
Cuz it's hurtin' em' to see Fab in his best <end_line>
And they in they worst <end_line>
They rather see me lay in the hearse than lay in the back<end_line>
And I ain't just layin a verse <end_line>
I'm sayin the facts <end_line>
I came back with some sicka stones <end_line>
That got these broke niggaz lookin at me like they chokin' on a chicken bone <end_line>
Every chick I bone <end_line>
Can't leave the dick alone <end_line>
So I know <end_line>
It's one of them everytime I flip my phone <end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I see em on the block when I passes <end_line>
Lookin like they need oxygen mask-es <end_line>
I make it hard to BREATHE <end_line>
But I keep the glocks in the stashes <end_line>
Cuz the cops wanna lock and harass us <end_line>
And make it hard to BREATHE <end_line>
They has to react <end_line>
Like havin' a asthma attack <end_line>
When they see the plasma in back <end_line>
You dudes are wheezin' behind me <end_line>
My flow is like a coupe, breezin at 90 <end_line>
That's the reason they signed me <end_line>
It's quick metaphors and hard punches on the cuts <end_line>
Feels somethin' like hard punches to the gut <end_line>
How I address the haters and under estimaters <end_line>
And ride up on them like they escalators <end_line>
They shook up and hooked up to respirators <end_line>
On they last breath talking to investigators <end_line>
I'm a breath of fresh air <end_line>
And a fresh pair <end_line>
Face it boo and do it till your face get blue <end_line>
And then BREATHE <end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
When the crew walk in it <end_line>
Pop a few corks in it <end_line>
As quick as a tick in a New York minute <end_line>
Catch a breath, fore u catch a left <end_line>
Even worse, catch a Tef <end_line>
Only way u catch a F <end_line>
To the A-B, its in the maybe <end_line>
Rollin with my baby <end_line>
Grippin on a toy that you won't find in +KayBee+ <end_line>
I rhyme slick on ya <end_line>
I'm a have to put the Heimlich on ya <end_line>
What you know bout lettin' dimes lick on ya?<end_line>
While you inhale the weed <end_line>
And it won't stop till they inhale ya seed<end_line>
And it don't stop I tell em' to breathe <end_line>
Like a doctor with a stethoscope <end_line>
I don't see no fuckin hope <end_line>
Unless these motherfuckers BREATHE <end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Yeah, Brooklyn gotta<end_line>
Uptown gotta<end_line>
the Bronx gotta<end_line>
Queens gotta<end_line>
Staten Isle gotta<end_line>
You niggas gotta<end_line>
You bitches gotta<end_line>
Everybody BREATHE <end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
One and then the two <end_line>
Two and then the three <end_line>
Three and then the four <end_line>
Then you gotta.. BREATHE<end_line>
Then you gotta.. <end_line>
Then you gotta.. <end_line>
Oh* BREATHE<end_line>
