Guess what time it is?  My, my, my time<end_line>
You can check your iPhone, better say it's our time<end_line>
I don't even need a watch, I don't even see a clock<end_line>
Soon as a I walk in, it feel like me o'clock<end_line>
Yeah, me o'clock, everytime I check<end_line>
Niggaz don't measure up and try to blame the Pyrex<end_line>
I'm a do it bigger than a 5X<end_line>
Can't ride with a L, so I don't drive Lex<end_line>
Game's so bickery, so full of trickery<end_line>
Nursery rhyming, hickory, dickory<end_line>
Blowin that sour, the hood call it pickery<end_line>
Biggie, Puffy, Busta, +Victory+, yes<end_line>

My time's more like fly time<end_line>
Don't call it gettin dressed, call it in the sky time<end_line>
If you ain't a pilot, you probably couldn't style it<end_line>
Unless you was a stewardess, you won't know what to do with this<end_line>
First I took the time out, then I put the time in<end_line>
Money ain't everything, it's more about the timing<end_line>
So I got the Audemars, flawless diamonds<end_line>
In other words that's called perfect timing<end_line>
I feel like a favor, I feel like a savior<end_line>
They clockin my neck, I feel like I'm Flavor<end_line>
I go so hard, Loso God<end_line>
Dance, scream, fid-di-di-di-damn<end_line>
<verse_end>
