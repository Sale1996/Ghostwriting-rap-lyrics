<verse_start>
My young's get it fucked when ya talk about this game<end_line>
like it's designed in their favor<end_line>
Like it ain't outlined for them to waver their rights for a little fame<end_line>
Get into bullshit fights for a little name to get<end_line>
noticed by some niggaz that don't give two fucks about you<end_line>
Till you make them a few bucks they doubt you<end_line>
Tell them you don't do the jobs and shucks and they<end_line>
route you to the shelf<end_line>
See there is no money is good health<end_line>
So they need you to be sick with it<end_line>
Ill content and delivery niggaz<end_line>
This nation thrives of misery nigga<end_line>
So if you ain't trying to let you hard times increase my wealth<end_line>
Nigga keep that progressive shit to yourself<end_line>
This is the business of buying souls and we only fuck<end_line>
with those who try to sell them<end_line>
You see they may see me as an adversary cuz they know<end_line>
i'm trying to tell them about the farest artist who<end_line>
grow only to meet indutry acess<end_line>
How they take a niggaz dreams and write them off in their taxes<end_line>
Contracts is confusing<end_line>
But don't worry they'll appoint the lawyer for you<end_line>
Whore you<end_line>
Loan you funds to fuck your soul and make you pay it all back<end_line>
and still maintain control of stroll your track and your hot ass slow flow<end_line>
They'll keep you looking good and all that<end_line>
But no dough<end_line>
You see when they get a bitch they got a bitch<end_line>
Incontrary to popular opinion it ain't my sisters that<end_line>
switch is my brothers we the dumb motherfuckers<end_line>
Harderst niggaz in the street turn to industry suckers<end_line>
cuz we refuse to do the knowledge<end_line>
Nigga you can't learn this shit in the streets or in college<end_line>
So you better pick up a book or something<end_line>
Or fuckin Black Ice will put it in a hook or something<end_line>
and hope that you listen to it<end_line>
Got you pumpin that poison while they paint you them<end_line>
illlusionary parades and keep pissing through it<end_line>
You pussies don't know price or the sacrifice that<end_line>
this industry makes real niggaz walk<end_line>
