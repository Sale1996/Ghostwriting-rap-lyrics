More better, more cheddar<end_line>

Challenge me with the bling these niggas know better<end_line>
The wings are as big as the logo on those sweaters<end_line>
Hoes better have a fall back attack<end_line>

Couple 6-deuces all back to back<end_line>
Few flying Spur, all back to back<end_line>
Need a 04 05 Duncan and them<end_line>
When it come to makin O's we like dunkin with them<end_line>

And that the shit on my wrists is just co-signing<end_line>
They don't search us, they know we got the flamers<end_line>
Still let us slide through the door like Kramer<end_line>
I believe in God, but my true religion<end_line>
