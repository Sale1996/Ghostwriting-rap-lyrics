<verse_start>
I don't got time for all this<end_line>
Just fast forward to the part where he start killing shit<end_line>
Yeah like right here<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Tough times don't last but tough people do<end_line>
I father niggaz the way wayne and puff reproduce<end_line>
Lil rap bastards<end_line>
Running round with your snapback caps backwards<end_line>
Should be in rap caskets<end_line>
Who you think showed them the go hard with stunting<end_line>
And who you think showed 'em that those broads was nothing<end_line>
And who you think showed 'em that those cars was something<end_line>
And when fathers day came I got no card or nothing<end_line>
So I ain't out here trying to expose frauds for nothing<end_line>
And I ain't out here pulling these hoes cards for nothing<end_line>
They was bitches on deck y'all, made 'em queens<end_line>
Watching sports with a chick that got ball player dreams<end_line>
I'm watching these dogs play with my old bones<end_line>
I feel like niggaz done found one of my old phones<end_line>
We in the house, y'all looking to hold loans<end_line>
And when the market was up, you wouldn't have sold homes<end_line>
So this the foreclosure of the wannabe<end_line>
If you can't be yourself, then who you gonna be?<end_line>
Dad to your swag, your style was like a son to me<end_line>
Your stylist got thank yous, you never sent one to me<end_line>
Lets pray for 'em<end_line>
Y'all repeat this one with me<end_line>
"now I lay me down to sleep, I pray for those who run with me<end_line>
If I die before I wake, arrest the girl I brung with me<end_line>
I give the Lord my swag to take whenever God is done with me"<end_line>
<verse_end>
