Huh, these bitches see how I kit it<end_line>
You can hear my coupe a block away<end_line>
Bitches be yellin, "Let Me Ride" like they Snoop and Dr. Dre<end_line>
I keep spittin, them clips copped on those calicos<end_line>
Keep shittin, with ziplocks of that cali dro'<end_line>
Keep hittin, and shift blocks for that cali dough<end_line>
Keep gettin, my tip rocked by them cali hoes<end_line>
It's William Bonnie, still the mamis<end_line>
Dance closely, even though they feelin blinded<end_line>

<verse_start>
Yo ma, I got you stuck off the realness<end_line>
The name's Fabolous, you heard I be <end_line>
In them trucks wit the wheels glissed<end_line>
In V.I.P, with buckets of chilled Cris'<end_line>
'click, click', who the fuck wanna feel this<end_line>
I still got them blocks movin, and the system in my truck<end_line>
that can make it feel like the block's movin<end_line>
My 6-4's, wit the wheels and the shocks movin<end_line>
Them boys in blue with the shields and the glocks movin<end_line>
I'm the same ol' G<end_line>
The Guc' frames got the same gold G<end_line>
Duke can you frame O-3, cause if you see me on ya corner wit a 40<end_line>
It ain't gonna be named Olde E<end_line>
I might be in Chuck T's, or the chuckers<end_line>
And if you duck cheese I'ma fuck her, duck these motherfucker<end_line>
Ghetto Fabolous, nigga I ride 'til I die<end_line>
Hollerin 1-8-7 when I ride through the Stuy, fool<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
The kid pull the four out a little quicker<end_line>
You might end up the reason, ya homies<end_line>
will have to pour out a little liquor<end_line>
Every stack that a draws out a little thicker<end_line>
I get brain, kick the whores out a little quicker<end_line>
You kids rap that's cool<end_line>
But the kid's wrapped in jewels, the kid clapped that tool<end_line>
Kidnap that fool, you don't wanna wake up gettin told<end_line>
that ya kids trapped at school<end_line>
When the time's right, I'ma put this nine right<end_line>
to the left side of ya head, push ya mind right<end_line>
It's still nothin but a G thang, I thought you knew<end_line>
And I'm bout to do the numbers that they thought you do<end_line>
Still don't know me, still jump in a Lex<end_line>
The chain so icey, I got chill bumps on my neck<end_line>
The NARCS heard, how the krills pump in the jet<end_line>
Still bumpin ya dex, still dumpin the tec, still<end_line>
<verse_end>
