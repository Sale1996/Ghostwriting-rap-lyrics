I walk up in the spot and see tonight we have a packed house<end_line>
We all in the building and it's rockin like a crack house<end_line>
All the sexy women wearin dresses with their backs out<end_line>
My neck is usually lit up but tonight we have a black out<end_line>
Call me Tom Edison cause I'm about to light up<end_line>
My head is in the clouds, feel like it just took a flight up<end_line>
They tryin to slow me down like that syrup in them white cups<end_line>
Clear that I'ma bubble like you shook a fuckin Sprite up<end_line>
I don't see nobody; I ain't goin blind though<end_line>
I don't see nobody, stoppin me from mine yo<end_line>
We the money game, we throw up dollar signs hoe<end_line>
My gun from out of town it make you change your state of mine hoe<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Bottles of Rose' keeps findin its way to my section<end_line>
And groups of pretty bitches with them light skin good complexion<end_line>
Told her I'ma kill it and I use Magnum protection<end_line>
I just slide up in it baby that's lethal injection<end_line>
I'm about that money, pussy's what a fool chase<end_line>
Hoes'll have you tied up, bitch I ain't no shoe lace<end_line>
Smirkin in my black shades, my BBM cool face<end_line>
But I will fix you niggaz, you'll make me get my tool case<end_line>
I don't see nobody, but it ain't my vision<end_line>
I see I'm what it is, and you are what it isn't<end_line>
Lights out niggaz, assume the position<end_line>
With my eyes close I see there is no competition<end_line>
