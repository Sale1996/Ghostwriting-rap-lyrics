<verse_start>
These niggas act like, I ain't sling the clip at the last lane<end_line>
And ran to the cops, to bring the tips of the last names<end_line>
Like I ain't bring the shipments, and past caine<end_line>
And sticky that'll leave ya finger tips wit the grass stains<end_line>
Like I don't swing and zip through the fast lane<end_line>
Would you believe, this ringer chipped me a fast Range<end_line>
Like I ain't sling on stips, till my past fame<end_line>
And stacked it up, like the Pringle chips, when the cash came<end_line>
Like I ain't fling and dip, when the task came<end_line>
I knew these niggas sing like pits, so I stash change<end_line>
The singles chipped in my ass changed<end_line>
But this player never pay for, them rings and whips, just to gas dance<end_line>
I'm why you stay in touch wit ya writer<end_line>
Even made you pick up ya pen, and start clutchin it tighter<end_line>
I ain't much of a fighter<end_line>
But I know, everything about rollin up, like a Dutch in a Spyder<end_line>
My dope is much more than whiter<end_line>
One hit'll have the fiends yellin out, they need crutches and lighters<end_line>
The Fed's can't touch us indict us, and the hoes can't even get numbers<end_line>
They wanna stay in touch, they could write us, nigga<end_line>
