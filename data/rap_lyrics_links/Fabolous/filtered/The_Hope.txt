<verse_start>
Tooly to your waves, brain on your winter coat<end_line>
Niggas burnin' bridges then expectin' you to send a boat<end_line>
If I'm comin' at your neck think a bullet in the throat<end_line>
Never gone forget you niggas, got 'em written in my notes<end_line>
I'mma send the goons, a snitch gone send the folks<end_line>
They gone kill you just cause, don't make me send the locs<end_line>
New blue hundredsspendin' c-notes<end_line>
Fresh pair of Timbs, vintage pea-coats<end_line>
I'm a stand up nigga, never been a joke<end_line>
Ridin' since pedal bikes with reflectors and the spokes<end_line>
I snuck up from behind, put the game in a yolk<end_line>
You apply a little pressure and them rookies finna choke<end_line>
Niggas lookin' washed up, it's something in the soap<end_line>
You lookin' like Adrien Broner in the ropes<end_line>
My shoes is 2 racks, I should be in the slopes<end_line>
Might come through in bubble same way they send the pope<end_line>
Paradin' down 5th Ave like I'm in a float<end_line>
That new H50 push button like remote<end_line>
Control is hard to have, especially when you broke<end_line>
They sleepin' because they eatin', but you hungry and you woke<end_line>
Shorty mouth wet, but her strength is in the stroke<end_line>
Greatest of all time so her name has been the goat<end_line>
She say you got the people waitin' for it then it's dope<end_line>
The game is fucked up, but if you back then it's hope, nigga<end_line>
