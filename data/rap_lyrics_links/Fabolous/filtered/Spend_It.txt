<verse_start>
I'm ridin round to my city, emphasis on my city<end_line>
This bullsht ain't gon carry on<end_line>
No none of that shit fly with me<end_line>
Yeah I'm back with my guy with me<end_line>
That boy named Trigga Trey<end_line>
We ridin round we gettin it<end_line>
Maybe I stay out them niggaz way<end_line>
Just like the late Bigga say<end_line>
More money, more problems<end_line>
Matter fact I'd rather that to having no money be your problem<end_line>
If hustle plus muscle equals success then it's no problem<end_line>
Think I care if you fuck with me<end_line>
No sir that's a ho problem<end_line>
We be on the loud shit<end_line>
Y'all be smoking that low volume<end_line>
Over here is going down, over there ain't no slalom<end_line>
I'm so fly I need a co-pilot<end_line>
Need a ride but with low mileage<end_line>
And all my girls be holding in the back, no wallet<end_line>
