You ain't gotta worry 'bout her, shorty straight<end_line>
Been chasin her for two days, First 48<end_line>
A bad bitch cost, she worth every cent<end_line>
She look like the best money that I ever spent<end_line>
Just watchin my cutiepie get beautified<end_line>
Make me want better jewels, a newer ride<end_line>
Louis Vuitton shoes, she got too much pride<end_line>
Her feet are killin her, I call it shoeicide<end_line>
Lookin good has it's sacrifices<end_line>
Chilly weather bring four figure jacket prices<end_line>
Her body nice, face dime<end_line>
Give you that iPhone 4, face time<end_line>
Shorty in the streets, still handle the home<end_line>
Enough class for wine, still handle patron<end_line>
When them other hoes call I hand her the phone<end_line>
And she hand 'em the tone<end_line>
Uh! Uh! OHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!<end_line>

Yeah I know that's what they all says<end_line>
She gotta donkey with a Juan Valdez<end_line>
Keep it clean cut like bald heads<end_line>
Been playin with that green long as Paul Pierce<end_line>
So you gotta ball harder than the ball players<end_line>
All she wanna know, is there a mall near us<end_line>
Can't fault her, the last nigga spoiled her<end_line>
But he ain't beat it up, I assault her<end_line>
Should've seen her come to me when I called her<end_line>
Slow strut like she walkin to the altar<end_line>
Hand bag on her arm cost four bills<end_line>
And she ain't gotta beg, borrow or steal<end_line>
Often imitated, never duplicated<end_line>
They say she a dime, I say she underrated<end_line>
I just met her so the next solution<end_line>
Dead my old chick, execution<end_line>
