I think everybody remember they first time<end_line>
I do, irresistable, it's unstoppable<end_line>
Guess who, first time Fab<end_line>
Sound like you hear me for the first time again baby ha-ha<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Now my first time checkin you, only took a second to<end_line>
Start inspectin you, without disrespectin' you<end_line>
Wasn't expectin' you to say it was affectin' you<end_line>
What you wearin' got me starin' like you butt naked boo<end_line>
It may seem like I don't even reckon you<end_line>
But I day dream, about kissin' on the neck of you<end_line>
Style is impeccable, smile is incredible<end_line>
Ain't nothin' like ya, and baby I done met a few<end_line>
The way I feel it's almost like crush<end_line>
My heart beats faster it's almost like a rush<end_line>
And that's just when you enter in a room<end_line>
I could tell when you around by the scent of ya perfume<end_line>
I see why they put the R&B songs together<end_line>
I feel like Mariah "We Belong Together"<end_line>
It's my pleasure, I treasure, that I met ya<end_line>
Bet ya I could get ya on the first time<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Now I remember datin', the first time was intimidatin'<end_line>
No rush though I spent the whole November waitin'<end_line>
Come on, look at the patience that I'm demonstratin'<end_line>
After a Week or two I usually start eliminatin'<end_line>
But we got through the convo on the phone<end_line>
Now we finally chillin' in the condo all alone<end_line>
I tried to be expressive, with out being aggressive<end_line>
Just being suggestive, a little more impressive<end_line>
And I'm a good player I listen to the coach<end_line>
He showed me the play book and said this is the approach<end_line>
If you ever wanna score, cause some players rush they shots<end_line>
And that's why they never on the floor<end_line>
And that's why we both feel comfortable<end_line>
Like long time friends, only been a month or two<end_line>
I got moves, and I know When to make'em but<end_line>
I only give'em if I know you can take'em<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Now before the first time we layed down in the bed<end_line>
You ain't know the kinda thing that playd around in my head<end_line>
I ain't play around when I said you gon remember this<end_line>
Might even turn ya self on when you reminisce<end_line>
Our first time we were like virgins with experience<end_line>
A lil' shy but I urged you to experiment<end_line>
Things got weterI mean betterIm gettin' numb<end_line>
Im about to ccccum come on now not yet boo slow down<end_line>
We just stepped in the ring need a few more rounds<end_line>
That's the first time it felt like that<end_line>
Now you know why Fabolous is spelt like that<end_line>
<verse_end>
