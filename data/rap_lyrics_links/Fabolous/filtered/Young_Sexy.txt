I'm so VIP, and Notorious for doing it B.I.G. girl<end_line>
You ain't gotta see ID, I'm a rich young man<end_line>
Clean button up wit the rich young pairs<end_line>
Out of you young ladies, which one can - do it to the beat y'all<end_line>
Young niggaz get funny, just to get a name<end_line>
So you know I came with the heat y'all!<end_line>
You know I got a little money, got a little fame<end_line>
But you know I came from the streets y'all<end_line>
If you wanna act funny, I can do the same<end_line>
And when Pharrell let the beat fall<end_line>
Let me see you get your hands up high y'all<end_line>
Just like you're reaching for the sky y'all<end_line>

<verse_start>
From the high heels to low cuts<end_line>
To the dude in the fast car wit the slow strut girl<end_line>
They wanna catch J. Jackson<end_line>
But the money's longer than a stretch Maybach Benz<end_line>
They say I'm fly enough to do better<end_line>
But pimp enough to not give a fuck<end_line>
They say I'm old enough to know better<end_line>
But young enough to not give a fuck<end_line>
Tell Stella to move back, if she want Her Groove Back<end_line>
I get my young man on, then the young man gone<end_line>
Let's get money again, and even if you ain't<end_line>
I'll make you feel twenty again, so!<end_line>

<verse_start>
I'm too young to be sprung<end_line>
And you can tell I'm too blessed to be stressed<end_line>
My move is too smooth, on top of that I dress to impress<end_line>
The walk is so chilled, not to mention the Talk is so Real<end_line>
We all gotta get old, but before I do I'm a ball outta control<end_line>
Live young! die rich! woo!<end_line>
