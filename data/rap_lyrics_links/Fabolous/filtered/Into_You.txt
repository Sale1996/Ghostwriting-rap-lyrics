I can't really explain it<end_line>
I'm so into you now, I want to be more than a friend of you now<end_line>
When they ask, I mention my baby girl in the interviews now<end_line>
And I don't bring the problems from the 90's into 2 Thou'<end_line>
There's no reason to have a friend or two now<end_line>
'Cuz the kid's ready to tell you how he feel in a few vow's<end_line>
Maybe, I speak in general now<end_line>
But girl imma do whatever just to keep a grin on you now<end_line>
Where I go, they wear bikini's in the winter too now<end_line>
What you think about, tan lines on the skin of you now<end_line>
Why wouldn't I wanna spend a few thou'<end_line>
On 5th Ave. shopping spree's, and them dinners at Chao's<end_line>
I ain't concerned what other men would do now<end_line>
As long as when I slide up in you, you growl<end_line>
And any dude with you, he better be a kin of you now<end_line>
And I ain't jealous it's the principle now, I'm so into you<end_line>

Come on ma, it's more than a flashin<end_line>
I woulda traded it all, in orderly fashion<end_line>
My villa in Florida we crashin<end_line>
Just off the shore, so you can hear when water be splashin<end_line>
The drop top 3 and a quarter we dashin<end_line>
The flawless diamonds and the border we flashin<end_line>
The money, we oughtta be stashin<end_line>
I make sure every quarter be cashed in, I can't really explain it<end_line>
My friend be thinkin I'm slippin<end_line>
These girls be thinkin I'm trippin<end_line>
What kinda weed he be smokin<end_line>
What type of drinks he be sippin<end_line>
Sweet thing, just to think of you dippin<end_line>
Would have me with the blue's so hard, you would think I was crippin<end_line>
Now, you relaxin' in the Benz<end_line>
Credit cards with no limits, so you don't worry about maxxin' when you spend<end_line>
Ever since you've been askin' 'bout the friends<end_line>
How'd you like it if, both our name's had Jackson on the ends, uh<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I don't wanna trip, but truth is<end_line>
Girl the way you cook a steak, remind me of those strips in Ruths Chris<end_line>
You love my smile, no matter how chipped my tooth is<end_line>
With you, it ain't becuase my whips is roofless<end_line>
Or sit on chrome dipped dub deuces<end_line>
And you aint flattered by canary envy es dipped Jesus'<end_line>
Other ballers look dumb when they press you, 5 and 6's<end_line>
You don't let them kinda numbers impress you<end_line>
Even though I was somewhat successfull<end_line>
Bein a player was becoming too stressfull<end_line>
But every since, the superwoman has come to my rescue<end_line>
My winter's been wonderful, my summer's been special<end_line>
Let's fly to St. Bart, while the villa be painted<end_line>
Just so we can get really aquainted<end_line>
The love is real, there's no way it could feel like it's tainted<end_line>
But I can't really explain it, uh, yeah<end_line>
