Bounce up and down, need no tremblin'<end_line>
Made it slow down, no promethazine<end_line>
Run me my money, no hesitance<end_line>
You no my work, no need resume - bounce<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Look, ain't go to say that I flex, check my biceps<end_line>
In your bitch mouth like Iâm gossip<end_line>
That boy be so fresh to death, bury me in my closet<end_line>
Don't make excuse, make deposit<end_line>
Ain't e'en suppose to be here boy, I come from the projects<end_line>
Shawty just fuck with my progress<end_line>
I swear I came here with nothin', all this shit is profit<end_line>
Should look at me like a prophet<end_line>
And when these niggas throw subs it just confirm I'm gangsta<end_line>
Scared to say my name now ain't 'cha?<end_line>
No disrespect, we just on different sides of the wave<end_line>
Iâm providin' the wave, you just ridin' the wave - bounce<end_line>
<verse_end>
