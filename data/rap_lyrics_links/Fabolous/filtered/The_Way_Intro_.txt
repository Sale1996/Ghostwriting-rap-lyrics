<verse_start>
I said, fuck 'em all, motherfuck 'em all<end_line>
Y'all done turned a good guy into a Chuckie doll<end_line>
I would a been your friend 'til the end bitch<end_line>
And guess it ain't no friends in this shit business<end_line>
Just a bunch of assholes in a shit business<end_line>
But they won't flush me down the toilet bowl without my tissue<end_line>
These bitches talk shit out the same mouth that kiss you<end_line>
These niggaz kiss ass with the same mouth that diss you<end_line>
Eww, you niggaz disgust me<end_line>
And they ain't talkin 'bout shit unless they discuss me<end_line>
Let's talk about how I'm killin everything I touches<end_line>
Or how I walked in this game with no crutches<end_line>
No Diddy, No Dupri, No Dr. Dre<end_line>
No Cash Money from Baby and no Rocs from Jay<end_line>
And I'm still here, we still here<end_line>
What does this break dude? It's still here<end_line>
And dude talk, concernin New York<end_line>
When I was runnin the city, you was learnin to walk<end_line>
So I watched you niggaz take they first steps and I was happy for ya<end_line>
Daddy was clappin for ya<end_line>
But wasn't for me it probably wouldn't of happened for ya<end_line>
So I rest my case, I'm a rappin lawyer<end_line>
That's unless you wanna talk bad bitches<end_line>
Section full of Bridezillas, that's mad bitches<end_line>
No words, I describe 'em with letters best<end_line>
They pretty as can 'B'/be, curvy as the letter 'S'<end_line>
They keep it 'G', they sweet as 'T'/tea<end_line>
Look good in the passenger seat of 'V'<end_line>
They ride double 'R', smell like double 'C'<end_line>
The bags are 'LV', 'D' or double 'G'<end_line>
Fly as hell, shades, wired cell<end_line>
On 'E', sippin 'PJ', high as hell<end_line>
And please don't even talk about swag<end_line>
I'm cool and collective, a fool with perspective<end_line>
I'm far from being typical, my respect is reciprocal<end_line>
I already came up, you still on the zipper pull<end_line>
And I would say my style is 5th Ave. meets Brooklyn<end_line>
I keep the hood watchin, I got the streets lookin<end_line>
They watch what I do, so they know what to do<end_line>
Little money never told big money what to do<end_line>
Money talks, if you speak Guap-anese<end_line>
A language better known if you gettin cheddar homes<end_line>
If not get a loan, use that like Rosetta Stone<end_line>
And that way you can holla 'bout a dollar<end_line>
I hear 'em cryin broke, they holla like a toddler<end_line>
Come holla at yo guala, don't holla at Savalas<end_line>
You'll end up down under tryin to holla at koalas<end_line>
I keep that nine on me, ala Iguodala<end_line>
We can get it jumpin like the 'drolics on Impala<end_line>
I feel like Nino lettin them Rottweilers off the collar<end_line>
Somebody tell me something, What the fuck happened?<end_line>
Somebody talk to me, motherfuck rappin<end_line>
They infiltrated the game but who let in the Pookies?<end_line>
Kingpins is snitchin that shit is not Lukey<end_line>
So fuck new friends, Lefty stay solo<end_line>
'Cause who gon' watch your back after you kill Manolo?<end_line>
Isn't it ironic Santana's own fella stabbed him?<end_line>
The "King of New York" died while they yellow cabbed him<end_line>
No "Carlito's Way", when I spot a hater drop him like a hot potato<end_line>
You won't hear he got me later<end_line>
Yeah I keep it gangsta but I'm a do it my way<end_line>
The new day of the week is called "Myday"<end_line>
So it's my say, pass my K<end_line>
I'm through talkin<end_line>
<verse_end>
