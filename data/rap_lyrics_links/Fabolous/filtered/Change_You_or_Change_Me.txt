You know what?<end_line>
Everybody goes through some changes in life<end_line>
Some poeple change for the better, some poeple change for the worse<end_line>
But umm, some people need to make that change<end_line>
You know what I mean? Change is good sometimes. You know?<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Why would I change? I ain't never slide down a bad pole<end_line>
Even though I'm certified over plat's sold<end_line>
They say I'm different 'cuz I ride in a plat. Rolls<end_line>
But every time, we gotta ride don't this cat roll?<end_line>
I never snitch, and go and hide in a rat hole<end_line>
And I aint givin' you nothing besides what this gat hold<end_line>
No pride, I ain't that old<end_line>
Cut off a few, but kept a few girls I decide like I'm ?????<end_line>
It probably don't seem like a struggle<end_line>
But I used to dream that this thug'll balance beams just to smuggle<end_line>
It's funny same girls that didn't seem like they'd love you<end_line>
Is beggin'for your autographs ands screamin' to hug you<end_line>
It's crazy, same dudes that seem like they thug you<end_line>
Is prayin' on your downfall, schemin' to mug you<end_line>
And people that didn't give a fuck, is dreamin' to bug you<end_line>
And goin through' extreme's just to plug you, who really changed?<end_line>

Why would I change? I didn't step out of Superman's phone booth<end_line>
To remind where I'm from, I look at my own tooth<end_line>
I'm speakin' the known truth<end_line>
I ain't been living the same, since I moved under Silvia Rone's roof<end_line>
Why would I feel like I'm a stranger?<end_line>
And why should I feel like I'm in danger?<end_line>
And I'm grindin' 'till I'm right<end_line>
Whether it's on the streets, or online tryna climb sites<end_line>
I ain't blind from the limelite,<end_line>
I had my mind and my rhymes right, and signed when the time's right<end_line>
People shouldn't be hateful, they should be grateful<end_line>
But fuck it, I guess I gotta keep my three eight full<end_line>
I'm playin, the game, like I'm, supposed<end_line>
Stayin, the same, like I'm, supposed<end_line>
Ghetto Fab in da house, hip hop hustler<end_line>
One million customers, and I still bust at ya<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Why would I change when I get green like the Incredible Hulk?<end_line>
I've chilled with the richest people to the ghettoest folks<end_line>
Known a few ????? and met a few locs<end_line>
Made a few comments, and said a few jokes<end_line>
But it's gettin' me sick, someone prescribe me some medicine<end_line>
Before the fame, the vibe was way better then<end_line>
Some have even became rivals instead of friends<end_line>
Only two become liable for settlements<end_line>
I grew up watchin the<end_line>
Now they hate to see a nigga drivin' the better Benz<end_line>
That's why the clubs be, deprivin' to let us in<end_line>
They know the family bring knives and barettas in<end_line>
I'm thankful for being allowed, fans for being the crowd<end_line>
How could my head be in the clouds?<end_line>
It's strange, what the fame'll do<end_line>
But you know what? The only one who seen the change from the fame is you<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I'm the same nigga man<end_line>
Same nigga, that ridin' with you<end_line>
Niggas that's fuckin' with you<end_line>
I'm still fuckin' with you niggas<end_line>
The same nigga, these hoe's ain't like<end_line>
Now they on my dick right? Haha... shit is crazy<end_line>
Don't let this game change you nigga...<end_line>
