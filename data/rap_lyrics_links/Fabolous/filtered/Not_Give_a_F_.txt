I'm something like a phenomenon<end_line>
But still dumpin whenever the dramas on<end_line>
Ya'll hustlas can't eat fit meals and it feels<end_line>
Something like when it's Ramadan<end_line>
Hope you chumps been walkin wit armor on<end_line>
I'm who they dumpin two colahamelson<end_line>
Oh somethings turning his mama on<end_line>
I love to see rumps in Farragama thongs<end_line>
Bet it look dope when you got pajamas on<end_line>
Jump in, lets hit the Bahamas ma<end_line>
And it's crunk whenever I'm on a song, bumpin like bump bu-bump<end_line>
I'm particulary picky<end_line>
When it come to licky licky<end_line>
Have em slidin off them vickies quickly<end_line>
Under the du-rag thick 360<end_line>
It's the hypno and sticky icky<end_line>
