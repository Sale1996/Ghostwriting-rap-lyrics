Yo, yall gon' hear this in the nightclubs for a year<end_line>
When the song go on, throw on, ya tight mugs or ya stares<end_line>
It's like Bugs up in here<end_line>
Like Thugs up in here<end_line>
Throw ya fingas up like you gon' snipe slugs in the air<end_line>
Haters - might have a slight grudge when I'm there<end_line>
See the strobes on my wrist, light bubbles in my ear<end_line>
Ladies pass through, I might rub on her rear<end_line>
Pop Cris' in her face, make her wipe suds from her hair<end_line>
Even dykes tug on my gear the way I like strut up in here<end_line>
Don't get the Nike's smudged that I wear<end_line>
Drinks be flingin, minks be swingin<end_line>
The way the pinky-ringin, link be blingin, you think we slingin?<end_line>
I wanna see the roof of your coupe, sittin behind ya<end_line>
18 inches and up, no sittin on minors<end_line>
After tha club hittin a diner, spittin the lines<end_line>
And end up in a hotel, gettin vagina<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Ma, it's hard to stop and not admit it<end_line>
You like the way the drop I got is kitted<end_line>
Cops can't spot who is it<end_line>
You wanna stop and jot ya digits<end_line>
Must be how I hop on yatchs and visit, tropic spots I did it<end_line>
The top the watch is glitted<end_line>
Make niggas wanna bop they knots, stop and plot to get it<end_line>
Like I won't pop a shot in fitteds<end_line>
I got the type of machine guns that cops and swats prohibit<end_line>
I wanna drop but not to hit it, stop we not committed<end_line>
Think we hittin shoppin spots, forget it<end_line>
Move ya neck, rock from side to side<end_line>
Neva get checked, me and my glock side and side<end_line>
This in ya deck let it knock inside ya ride<end_line>
We in the 'jects of the blocks in the widest five<end_line>
Spendin a grands nutin for 'lous<end_line>
You aint got on a badge playa, so why you handcuffin the chicks?<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Yall hardly see I be 'round<end_line>
But when I do, I be, I be down in a VIP lounge<end_line>
I get in the club, I dont need ID now<end_line>
Bulky knit, can't even see my 3-pound<end_line>
Yall know how that kid from B-Stuy be down<end_line>
Yall see my C-pound, yall see yall be drowned<end_line>
Skee-o, gotta, re-ply she down, which sheet I meet down<end_line>
I know she gettin right- HEY<end_line>
Ladies tug me when I strut<end_line>
So this thug be in the cut, takin bubbly to the gut<end_line>
Rays beamin, yall think I be day-dreamin<end_line>
But I stay schemin like, "Shortie could get it"<end_line>
Next screenin, they see all this ice and grey gleamin<end_line>
They like "Damn, Shortie could get it"<end_line>
And I may be crazy<end_line>
But I see some ladies tonite that should be drinkin my baby's baby<end_line>
