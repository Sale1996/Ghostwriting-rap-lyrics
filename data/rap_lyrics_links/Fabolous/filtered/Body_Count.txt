Mo' bodies, I'm back for mo' bodies<end_line>
The competition is a skinny bitch, no body<end_line>
I'm runnin and I knows it, that's why I'm so snotty<end_line>
You little boys sit yo' ass down, go potty<end_line>
I see dead people, I see dead people<end_line>
I look in my pocket and I see dead people<end_line>
One, two, three, body count<end_line>
I check my other pocket, more bodies found<end_line>

Let's keep it a hundred, that's word to Ben Frank<end_line>
Money's what you can count on when your friends ain't<end_line>
Grass green over here, green like the kushes<end_line>
I got Presidents in my jeans like the Bushes<end_line>
And we don't chase money - we chase dreams<end_line>
Rub this money in your face - face cream<end_line>
Doctors say I have a problem I see nuttin but the bread<end_line>
Told me close my eyes "what you see," y'all know what I said!<end_line>

And if I go, make sure the family gets the cash<end_line>
And at my funeral there's only one wish I ask<end_line>
Give the haters a chance to see me cause this they last<end_line>
Turn me over and one by one let 'em kiss my ass<end_line>
I see dead people, I see dead people<end_line>
Pocket full of ego, big head people<end_line>
One two three, body count risin<end_line>
Now e'rybody got their hand out, fuckin Heisman<end_line>
Your boy just convinced her that she gorgeous<end_line>
Must have took a couple thousand of them Georges<end_line>
They call me Funeral, they call us broadtrich<end_line>
Face on point, they should call us swordfish<end_line>
He got a gang of money, you can't stop his drive<end_line>
He in the blue six screamin out stop it five<end_line>
Black out jewelry, you still see it though<end_line>
