She said you been in the streets, you was with that ho again<end_line>
Money wrapped in rubberbands, what ya sellin blow again?<end_line>
How she got you holdin guns but you call that ho your friend?<end_line>
You ainít 'posed to bring her home, what you do? You show her in<end_line>
I was like show her in? Never that, oh no<end_line>
Anybody in the streets know that that's a "no no"<end_line>
So no I would never ever, ever, ever<end_line>
Baby I'm a G, yeah that's right, the seventh letter<end_line>
See one thing about the streets, I know where that heffa at<end_line>
And I bet she always be exactly where I left her at<end_line>
But you know we had a bond, no ring, no paper<end_line>
And I don't hear this shit when I bring home paper<end_line>
My ears to the streets, what you gon' tell us?<end_line>
You keep talkin down girl, you sound like you jealous<end_line>

You smell like you've been drinkin, the vibe from ya is strong"<end_line>
I said "baby that's cologne", she said "nigga that's PatrÛn<end_line>
If you wanna keep with them bad habits, that's fine<end_line>
You think I'm with it, then you out your rabbit ass mind<end_line>
They say Trix/tricks are for kids, most chicks would of slid<end_line>
But who ain't miss a visit through the six that you did?<end_line>

Who only see their daddy in them flicks on the fridge<end_line>

We goní get you to a hospital, as quickly as possible<end_line>
Life is full of obstacles, we goní get you through this one<end_line>
You looked me in my eye, when you told you was done<end_line>
I played her for a fool but I guess I was the foolish one<end_line>
Remember when she told me that she know how this dream ends<end_line>
Late night phone call from one of my close friends<end_line>
Tellin you that we are, rushin to the ER<end_line>
By this time tomorrow, we were supposed to be in D.R.<end_line>
Me blowin a cigar, you sippin a 'tini<end_line>
I told her pack her bags=2<end_line>
0and don't forget her bikini<end_line>
Then just like Houdini, it all disappeared<end_line>
The escape to Paradise didn't end like this I swear<end_line>
Sorry baby girl, I tried the best I could<end_line>
If I can't be in the streets, I guess heavenís just as good<end_line>
