<verse_start>
I'm old enough to know better, young enough to not give a fuck<end_line>
Rather hold my head high and die, than live and duck<end_line>
'Member I was down to die just to live it up<end_line>
But life's a bitch and that judge is quick to give her up<end_line>
They say life is short, instead we lookin through them bars<end_line>
Gotta keep yo' head up, I be lookin to the stars<end_line>
I've been through alot, wasn't lookin for no cars<end_line>
Didn't kill me though, now I'm hear lookin at the scars<end_line>
Sometimes you get caught by people lookin from a far<end_line>
That's how it is when you out here takin cookies from the jar<end_line>
That's what my son said they came and took him in his draws<end_line>
He support the family they took his mama favorite bra<end_line>
The feds snatched my favorite boy<end_line>
These the rainy days they say you should be savin for<end_line>
But when sun shines no one carry umbrellas<end_line>
And if they did we would look at them as dumb fellas<end_line>
I'm tryin to become somethin they probably become jealous<end_line>
Have alot to say about it but afraid to come tell us<end_line>
I'm hear to beat the odds that was set against me<end_line>
Wish the worst luck to anyone who bet against me<end_line>
I wanna be somebody somebody that's never been<end_line>
No squares in my circle best shape I ever been<end_line>
I'm growin up my daddy planted a seed<end_line>
My mama wanted me with a plan to succeed<end_line>
I was that kid in the ghetto hand full of seeds<end_line>
But I'm here now and I don't plan to recede<end_line>
Sometime I think I lucked up at the right time<end_line>
Imagined I would have fucked up that night slime<end_line>
It hurts to even think about it<end_line>
Would be in these streets thirsty tryin to get a drink about it<end_line>
Black hoodie, I'll pull that quatro cinco 'bout it<end_line>
Put that iron to yo' clothes like I'm takin wrinkles out it<end_line>
Take every Franklin, Grant, Jackson and Lincoln out it<end_line>
Look you in yo' eyes and tell you don't you even think about it<end_line>
So as you hear me droppin this rhyme<end_line>
Know my opportunity could have been stopped at a dime<end_line>
The life you chose come from lack of options sometime <end_line>
Gotta do what you gotta do, even optin to crime<end_line>
And who am I? without name droppin it I'm...<end_line>
Someone who saw the top and didn't stop he just climbed<end_line>
Someone who get money without droppin a dime<end_line>
And transform to yo' leader in my Optimus Prime<end_line>
So, for dinner, we stoppin at Prome<end_line>
'Round of yo' patron, topped with a lime<end_line>
Hold 'em up, look at yo' niggas and say<end_line>
There was no way out but we figured a way<end_line>
And now we chill, load it up and steal<end_line>
We just wish a nigga would but we know a nigga will<end_line>
But for real, good is how you feel<end_line>
But soon as a nigga good is as a nigga will <end_line>
And we don't owe these niggas nothin<end_line>
Put that in a nigga will<end_line>
<verse_end>
