Ay y'all, since yay tall, I've been like Ray Charles<end_line>
I don't see nobody, they all, lay sprawl<end_line>
whever they may fall, but that's really they call<end_line>
Watch the name you say y'all, I may call, back<end_line>
Once you see that K y'all, they fall, back<end_line>
I would rather spray y'all than pay y'all back<end_line>
A nigga got impaired vision, there isn't<end_line>
a person who can slow mine, I don't pay them no mind<end_line>
I just can't see it, baby girl I'm so blind<end_line>
Busy on my dope grind, I don't see no sign<end_line>
of them gettin close to this, I'm lookin picture perfect<end_line>
Hater you can posted this, I got a phone nigga<end_line>
cataract, nope, I don't even chatter back<end_line>
I just got the Caddy back, with the D's on that bitch<end_line>
Maybe it's the dark shades, blame these Mark Jacobs<end_line>
But if we sleepin on you niggaz, I ain't tryin to wake up<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I done lost sight of you niggaz<end_line>
When the lazy eye's left I cross right on you niggaz<end_line>
I need tintin, I'm squintin like the sun is in my eye<end_line>
But my nigga's on the trigger and the gun is on his thigh<end_line>
Wait for one of them to try, that's when one of them'll die<end_line>
There's a lot of pussy niggaz but not one of them is I<end_line>
I, make it possible for you to go bye bye<end_line>
In the hospital, you can find 'em by I, C-U<end_line>
no I don't see you<end_line>
Nah she don't see him, no we don't see them<end_line>
And you know mine roll like they wear a blindfold<end_line>
She won't let son in, she keep the blinds closed<end_line>
I remind hoes, we don't do the man starin<end_line>
It's about us, the rest of y'all are transparent<end_line>
Like my grandparents, I'ma need my glasses<end_line>
I don't see nobody fly as my conceited asses<end_line>
<verse_end>
