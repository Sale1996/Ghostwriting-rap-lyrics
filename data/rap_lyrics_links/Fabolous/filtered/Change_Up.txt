Yo, I make the money, but don't let it make me<end_line>
So even if I go broke nigga you couldn't break me<end_line>
Watch how long it take me to jump back on my feet<end_line>
Peep, quick is when the barrels jump back on the heat<end_line>
Y'all don't wanna see me jump back in the street<end_line>
So be happy that I rock them slumped back in the seats<end_line>
Being broke is a joke, I never found it funny<end_line>
That's why I count my blessings as much as I count my money<end_line>

Some niggaz change when they get change, funny when they get money<end_line>
Switch when they get rich, strayed when they got paid<end_line>
Ha~! But I stresses you to holla<end_line>
Cause they never made bullet proof vest-es out of dollars<end_line>
We never change, this is us every day<end_line>
I call them boys up, they gon' bust every 'K<end_line>
They ride high like them cust' Chevrolets<end_line>
Like O-Wax for Kaine, lookin for his cousin killers<end_line>
I got a dozen peelers for niggaz who doesn't feel us<end_line>
I changed for a reason but homey it wasn't scrilla<end_line>
They can't say that nuttin changed but my clothes<end_line>
Oh, I'm lyin, I do change up my hoes<end_line>
I pitch game you should see the change-up I throws<end_line>
And gotta get 'em a ring to get 'em to swing<end_line>
I'm a team player, if I win then we won<end_line>
And they gon' put us all in the Hall of Fame when we done<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Money can't buy happiness but it's a damn good down payment<end_line>
I don't talk much, feel like I'm around agents<end_line>
... the game ain't what it used to be<end_line>
I'm the same but these lames ain't used to me<end_line>
Them other niggaz, be full of theyselves<end_line>
Get money and disappear, try to pull a Chappelle<end_line>
Well - I ain't hidin I'm ridin; I ain't duckin I'm buckin<end_line>
I ain't hangin I'm bangin; I ain't willin I've done it<end_line>
<verse_end>
