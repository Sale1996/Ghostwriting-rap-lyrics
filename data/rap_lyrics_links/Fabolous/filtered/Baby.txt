<verse_start>
And why would I, and why should I<end_line>
when I seen a lady tonight, with my good eye that I would try and make<end_line>
I was up in the club putting my hood high<end_line>
When I saw you, and I stood by<end_line>
Just lookin at your onion girl I could cry, and I could lie<end_line>
I mean I could try and say you ain't sweep me off my feet<end_line>
But only one thing could keep me off the street<end_line>
and that's if you be my, B-A-B-Y<end_line>
I can be why you always be fly<end_line>
And I'm from B-Stuy, just like B.IG. was, that's how F-A-B does<end_line>
We can sip something 'til we both be buzzed<end_line>
In a V-dub and that's only be-cause<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Then I'ma lay you on your side<end_line>
And slowly stroke you while you telling me the way you feel inside<end_line>
But my sex drive won't make me play you on the side<end_line>
You know you get the keys any day you wanna ride<end_line>
And my baby know how to start me up<end_line>
You got the kind of kiss that'll speed a heartbeat up<end_line>
And you got the kind of touch that'll gimme the chills<end_line>
I ask you cuz I know you gonna gimme it real<end_line>
It won't be fake, and don't we make a good couple<end_line>
And won't we make a good?<end_line>
<verse_end>
