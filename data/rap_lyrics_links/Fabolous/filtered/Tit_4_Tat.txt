You see I do's what I choose on shiny twenty-two's<end_line>
Be's what I please in brand new Bentleys<end_line>
That's right stupid! Soon as they couped it, I went and scooped it<end_line>
Now I'm on the move, on the move<end_line>
Running the City, something like Diddy<end_line>
At 150, wit the gun and the cd<end_line>
niggaz who be hunting for biddies<end_line>
Never seen nothing this pretty, and they lying if they say they do<end_line>
They bring the playa through like they bring the mayor through<end_line>
They know the way I do is what the AK'll do<end_line>
Listen here we can disappear for a day or two<end_line>
Bet you come back smiling like Mase, c'mon!<end_line>
Like Case say 'Touch Me, Tease Me'<end_line>
But the Top Dawg tell her it must be easy<end_line>
I'm in the white cut E-Veezy<end_line>
Ashton Cuts be freezy, it must be easy!<end_line>

You see I bop to the beat of the streets since I was born<end_line>
Move like they would in the hood until I'm gone<end_line>
The girls know my paper denim, keep paper in em<end_line>
As soon as they change the shapes I'm in em<end_line>
The BAPEs they send em wit snake skin in em<end_line>
To the kid in the city wit the scrapers in em<end_line>
I move to left like.. then I move to the right like<end_line>
They follow the need to follow my lead<end_line>
Do the do then swallow my seed, like<end_line>
You can leave the spot you cramped in<end_line>
Live in the Hamptons like a champion<end_line>
Refuse to choose the, use the loser<end_line>
Don't let the hydro moves confuse ya<end_line>
And pass on a stunner to go wit a fronter<end_line>
If you wanna do the kick it then go wit a punter<end_line>

You see the white's so bright it's hard to be polite<end_line>
The yellow's so mellow I have to act ghetto<end_line>
Hello, my name is - fuck that! I'm famous<end_line>
Y'all ain't the same as, F-a to the B<end_line>
I don't know what it be, baby girl could it be<end_line>
You ain't see how good it be rolling wit me?<end_line>
Like - get me on or get me gone<end_line>
It's at least 22's that they sit me on<end_line>
I'm in the Ice Cream shoes, nice gleam too<end_line>
Crack the button up so the ice beam through<end_line>
You could wake up wit regrets, or wake up in a jet<end_line>
Fixing you hairdo in a Jacob wit baguettes girl<end_line>
