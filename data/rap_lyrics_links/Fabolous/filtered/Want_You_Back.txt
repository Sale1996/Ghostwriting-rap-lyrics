You see what I can't understand, is how somebody have a lifetime friend<end_line>
That they been through thick and thin with, and they just fall out over the simplest shit man<end_line>
Like, but that same person a be in a relationship with a triflin ass mu'fucker<end_line>
And keep takin him back, shit is crazy<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
The karma of fuckin over a good person, is the asshole you end up with<end_line>
Get a taste of your own medicine, funny you the one who end up sick<end_line>
Always took you back, even though it made my friends upset<end_line>
Told me I should blow you off havent got that wind up yet <end_line>
Know how many days I hurt, many nights I been up stressed<end_line>
Thought that we have been in love, maybe I just been upset<end_line>
When you crossed me you lost me, now if I was guardin Derrick Rose<end_line>
I would be more understandin but, you ain't Derrick Rose<end_line>
You was my number one but ummm you ain't Derrick Rose<end_line>
You tryin to make a point again, you ain't Derrick Rose<end_line>
You just on some bullshit bitch you ain't Derrick Rose<end_line>
I'm a lover and a fighter fight for what I love<end_line>
But you made certain of bitches I think nothin of<end_line>
Ask myself why fight when it's long been over<end_line>
God gives the hardest battles to the strongest soldiers <end_line>
So I fight for us long as there is reason to<end_line>
You wanted to give up on us long as there was season two<end_line>
Cool! You gonna need me one day<end_line>
And if it's sunday that one day 'gon be monday<end_line>
That's how fast things change sometime<end_line>
Niggas play the tough role I Ving Rhames sometime<end_line>
Like, like, like I don't want that bitch back!<end_line>
I mean I want her but I don't want the bitch back!<end_line>
She say she want him but she don't want that nigga back!<end_line>
That nigga act like I ain't had a nigga back<end_line>
