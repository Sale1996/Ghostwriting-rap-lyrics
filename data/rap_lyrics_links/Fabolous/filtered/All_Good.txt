I'm talkin' good dudes, good vibes and some good food<end_line>
Smokin' good with a playlist full of good grooves<end_line>
You know the shit you like to hear, like good news<end_line>
A couple Meagan Goods came through, made the hood move<end_line>
And slow motion for me<end_line>
She be frontin' like "Why all this commotion for me?"<end_line>
They talk about her shit, like they doing promotion for it<end_line>
But she single, cause they never show devotion for it<end_line>
She ain't never act too good for a nigga<end_line>
But she losing faith, she don't see no good in these niggas<end_line>
She like why I get treated bad, but be good to a nigga<end_line>
You do bad, you lose, too bad, good for you nigga<end_line>
It was<end_line>

She went +Cee-Lo+ with my Goodie Mob, yellin' out I fall better<end_line>
Life is a gamble, I was good luck for the betters<end_line>
Take a risk nigga, you gotta shoot to miss nigga<end_line>
Time is golden like that Rollie on your wrist nigga<end_line>
I hate when they gets figures then disfigured<end_line>
And when niggas get salty, thinkin' that shits sugar<end_line>
Huh, that's when good goes bad<end_line>
That's when niggas who just came home, could go back<end_line>
So let's keep the vibe right, keep the energy good<end_line>
Them boys would sit you down player like a injury would<end_line>
Then my niggas fuck with me before the Industry would<end_line>
Ridin' 'til the wheels fall off and the engine no good<end_line>
It was<end_line>
<verse_end>
