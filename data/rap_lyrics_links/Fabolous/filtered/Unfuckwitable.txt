What up<end_line>
Lets go<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I ain't feeling niggaz, I ain't that sentimental<end_line>
I got no words for 'em, lets just keep it instrumental<end_line>
I put it down where I stay, words to incidental<end_line>
And guess who opened the doors you niggaz entered in through<end_line>
Y'all will never measure up using my ruler<end_line>
You're more soft than a second year high schooler<end_line>
My nigga HOV told me finish my breakfast<end_line>
And now I'm looking at you niggaz like breakfast<end_line>
French toast, turkey bacon<end_line>
Shit's in bad shape, too many squares circulating<end_line>
Money talks and y'all voices are unheard<end_line>
When they ask about us, one word<end_line>
"unfuckwitable," we be in the town too<end_line>
That's why them boys call us the "not fucking around crew"<end_line>
Brooklyn keep on taking it, known to get our Debo on<end_line>
When you touch down, bow down get your Tebow on<end_line>
You won't say it in the streets, don't say it in your Tweets<end_line>
You won't say it when we meet, don't say it on them beats<end_line>
Real nigga shit, RNS<end_line>
Last night was a movie, starring us<end_line>
<verse_end>
