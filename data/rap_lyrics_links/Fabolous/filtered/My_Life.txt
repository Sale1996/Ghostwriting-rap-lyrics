I'm just Fab, I see how Mary be now<end_line>
But I can barely be found<end_line>
And I rarely be round<end_line>
But when I do, the jury be drowned<end_line>
And you can see how clear the Pavees, and the Canaries be now<end_line>
The top on the 5 series be down<end_line>
And I'm chillin' where them little houses on the prairie be now<end_line>
Although there was a time I would barely see thous<end_line>
But I'm gettin a multi-million dollar yearly fee now<end_line>
Girls, don't even know me, want to marry me now<end_line>
Dudes, I thought was homies, want to bury me now<end_line>
That's why I keep a bulletproof vest, no matter where we be now<end_line>
And I carry three pounds, and nearly three rounds<end_line>
I take whatever the verdict from the jury be now<end_line>
Rather than friends, it's pallbearers that carry me round<end_line>
Everybody staring unnecessarily now<end_line>
But there's no tints on my life, so you can clearly see now<end_line>

Ya'll can never be built like me, even if ya'll look at my blueprint<end_line>
But since ya'll watches look like its movement<end_line>
I'll show you how video games look on the new Sprint<end_line>
Flip out digital screens, look in the new Bent<end_line>
100 and flat screens, look in the new Pint<end_line>
Even our Air Forces lookin' to new tints<end_line>
I stay away from anythin that look like a nuisance<end_line>
But ya'll gotta peep this rookie's improvement<end_line>
I tip it with you and<end_line>
Cause most dudes was doin verses for a few dollars and a hook for a few cents<end_line>
All I do is try to teach and look to influence <end_line>
But it look like the students are playin hooky, and truin<end_line>
And some say that we lookin' like new gents<end_line>
But money talks, and it don't look like ya'll fluent<end_line>
And ya'll done seen how this "Young'n" look in the new pints<end_line>
But it's my life and you can't look in the new tints<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Uh, If I could say so myself, I came a long way<end_line>
Even though I feel like the same old John J.<end_line>
Nothin' change, when I aim, I'm gonna spray<end_line>
When I eat, I order the same old entree<end_line>
When I ride, I let the same old songs play<end_line>
And when I work, I do the same old long days<end_line>
From bein' Fab, to looked at by dames the wrong way<end_line>
They know where we came, from the name they call me<end_line>
I already know what these lames is gonna say<end_line>
And I already seen what games they gonna play<end_line>
Fuck with family, don't say the name the wrong way<end_line>
And when you die, ya'll crackers gonna blame it on strays <end_line>
<verse_end>
