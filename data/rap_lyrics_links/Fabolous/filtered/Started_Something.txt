<verse_start>
You bit off more than you can chew, ain't much more that I could do <end_line>
than go look for you niggas, I got a warrant for your crew <end_line>
Y'all done got me started, put me in this position<end_line>
Pushed my buttons, put the key in my ignition <end_line>
Nigga once the engine runnin', I'm comin' to injure somethin'<end_line>
Fuck me like I'm sex, promise revenge is comin'<end_line>
Sometimes, can't wait for karma to get 'em back <end_line>
And momma said "If they hit you, you better hit 'em back"<end_line>
See, that's how I was raised, that's how I'm not phased<end_line>
Cause I'm worth too much nigga, that's how I appraise <end_line>
I done cut off the frauds, disappeared enemies<end_line>
I'm not a fan of phony vibes and weird energy<end_line>
Even a friend of me, started hatin' on a G<end_line>
It seem petty like Bruce spelling his Kaitlyn with a C <end_line>
Man I see it all, if he tazed me, it wouldn't shock me<end_line>
Dawg I heard it all, if you Jay-Z, you couldn't rock/Roc me<end_line>
Couldn't +Knock+ me, so they had to go another route<end_line>
White sheets over you, for helpin' undercovers out <end_line>
Like Thanksgiving day, slide through your mother house<end_line>
We gon' pull them muffins out, blow a nigga stuffin out <end_line>
Shorty you know nothin' 'bout, finishin' games<end_line>
This the flow that blemish yo name, deminish yo fame<end_line>
Boy your whole style is trash, your image is lame<end_line>
I'll set yo' ass on fire, then extinguish yo' flame<end_line>
From start to finish, I finish then I start again<end_line>
Ran into yo broad again, I met her at the Party Inn<end_line>
Fed her that Bacardi then, spread it like acordians <end_line>
Then she made it clap for me, better than the audience<end_line>
She say you keep callin', tryna get her into arguments<end_line>
How you was cool but now you sweater like a cardigan<end_line>
Once you get a real nigga, get rid of the fraudulent<end_line>
I can handle that baby, tell me where he at baby<end_line>
<verse_end>
