I'm from the hood, so I'm supplying bomb rock<end_line>
'Round here that's better than buying from Viacom stock<end_line>
Look, you can't hold nothing, but I got a shell to give<end_line>

Ain't that his baby sis', get up in this Mayby' miss<end_line>

A small price to pay, son, it might cost your mother<end_line>
One of your grandparents, even your baby brother<end_line>
Cause everybody knows, everybody goes<end_line>
I want them in coffins, everybody's closed<end_line>
Related by the streets, this is family beef<end_line>
So you better not touch a branch on this family tree<end_line>
