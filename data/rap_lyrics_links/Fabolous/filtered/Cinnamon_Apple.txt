Look, I wanna take y'all back to 7th grade, middle school<end_line>
Skinny kid that everybody knew, I was a lil' cool<end_line>
Had my, initial ring, gold chain, my lil' jewels<end_line>
What was more than most had so I never got ridiculed<end_line>
This was '89, matter fact it was '90<end_line>
Crack was already huge, the streets start gettin' grimey<end_line>
But I wasn't in that world then<end_line>
I'm 13, all I'm thinkin' bout is Nike's, basketball and my girlfriend<end_line>
Yeah, who at the time was Tia Williams<end_line>
And she had no idea that one day I would see a million<end_line>
This is a teenage love, few months but we was building<end_line>
She was grown, I was the man but we was children<end_line>
She had ass though, I mean for her age or whatever<end_line>
She wore my ring sometimes like we engaged or whatever<end_line>
And this the "No, you hang up first" dial tone era<end_line>
Your mom's pick up and say "Hang up my house phone" era<end_line>
And I hated that, how you gon' scream in my baby ear?<end_line>
That pretty lil' brown skin girl with the baby hair<end_line>
As we was goin' steady, my sex drive was so Andretti<end_line>
She a virgin but I feel like it's time, I know she ready<end_line>
He ain't got much experience but she don't know that<end_line>
That boy's chance is comin' up, I hope he don't blow that<end_line>
I'm waitin' for the opportunity, mama at work<end_line>
Start with a kiss then I'm in her shirt, next I'm in her skirt<end_line>
You know that always heard that the first time gonna hurt<end_line>
That's what she heard from her cousin, 'lotta told her it doesn't<end_line>
And so to me, it's just a matter of time<end_line>
That Tia gon' give it up to me and that'll be mine<end_line>
But one day I was absent, I came back to school<end_line>
Learned that, I left the man but I came back the fool<end_line>
They said that "Tia did some bullshit, I mean did y'all speak?<end_line>
She cut school, lost her virginity, some kid named Khalif"<end_line>
And I'm stuck, like what the fuck?<end_line>
I ain't hear that my girl did what? But had to act like I ain't care<end_line>
Felt like I wanted to cry, but nah I ain't tear<end_line>
That first time I learned that trust ain't a must if I ain't there<end_line>
And of course we broke up, she moved on, I did the same<end_line>
I ended up with some next girl, forget her name<end_line>
Which probably isn't right, cause we used to get along<end_line>
But I remember Tia, cause she did me wrong<end_line>
