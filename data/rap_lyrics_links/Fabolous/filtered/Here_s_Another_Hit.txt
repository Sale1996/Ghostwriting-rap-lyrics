They say New York's got a problem, I'm their solution<end_line>
I'm the breath of freshness through this air pollution<end_line>
Dog you the smog that clogged up the city<end_line>
I jog through ya fog, dawg I'm the Diddy<end_line>
of this rap marathon, I'm lyrically in great shape<end_line>
My late tapes are like how to lose weight tapes<end_line>
The worst enertainers use me like a personal trainer<end_line>
They try to use my verses as gainer<end_line>
But these lightweight rappers, don't know what they up against<end_line>
I put they pockets on a weight loss supplement<end_line>
You're powder sniffin if you can't see our difference<end_line>
It's like dumbbell curls compared to powerliftin<end_line>
The way I pull up in whips<end_line>
It looks betta than the pullups and dips<end_line>
I'm bein done by the bartender<end_line>
I mean maybe it's my star spendin<end_line>
But better get her to that car window<end_line>
And shorty said her name was Carlinda<end_line>
That's cool, now won't you get up in this car Linda<end_line>
Later I could bend you like a car fender<end_line>
Have that ass wakin up tomorrow tender<end_line>
The perfect push-up, it make ya pecs swell<end_line>
I light the purple kush up, and then I exhale<end_line>
You gotta breathe, one and then the two<end_line>
I do a couple laps and be runnin it in 2<end_line>
I'm nutritious, I ain't in GNC<end_line>
Try the new dishes on the truck from GMC<end_line>
He emcee, he ain't got to do no dancin<end_line>
These diamonds are so performance enhancin<end_line>
I'm princess cut up, canaried them stones<end_line>
And I'm well known for how I bury 'em home<end_line>
I just do my thing, and then I carry 'em home<end_line>
I mean the world don't need another Marion Jones you heard?<end_line>
Cryin, lyin that she never did it<end_line>
Some women are Clemons, they just keep goin with it<end_line>
Don't sweat it, be like Pettite, just admit it<end_line>
And for the record they be sayin Barry Bonds hit it<end_line>
Get it? We outta here baby<end_line>
Loso is so outta here baby<end_line>
Street Fam is so outta here baby<end_line>
And here's another hit Barry Bonds<end_line>
Uhh, uh-huh ohh<end_line>
