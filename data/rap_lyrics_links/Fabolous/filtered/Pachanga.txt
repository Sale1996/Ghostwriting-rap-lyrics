Yo everything ain't love love, 'cause if it is<end_line>
My definition of love must differ his<end_line>
I mean every friendship has its differences<end_line>
But these Young Bucks remind me of Fif' and his<end_line>
They hear the good life, wanna see what the difference is<end_line>
Some just wanna smoke, enjoy the piff-leges<end_line>
He unwrap a cigar like it's a gift of his<end_line>
He a funny little nigga like Eddie Griffin is<end_line>
Between smokin and jokin then you got to live<end_line>
So I gave him a chance and that's a lot to give<end_line>
You 'posed to make the most of what you was paid to gross<end_line>
I gave you bread and butter you supposed to make the toast<end_line>
Fifteen years, FIFTEEN YEARS!<end_line>
And now when we say "what's up?", the shit seem weird<end_line>
But there's a question I prepared for you<end_line>
How could you fuck the only people who ever cared for you?<end_line>
A thug changes<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
There's a parallel path 'tween friends and enemies<end_line>
And whenever you cross it you make frienemies<end_line>
There's no remedies for these sick memories<end_line>
My doctor said there's no cure for the Emilys<end_line>
Had a +Crush On You+, now we Kim and Cease<end_line>
We don't even talk no more, it's no Biggie<end_line>
I was so Biggie, you was Faith<end_line>
I let you slide in my home, you was safe<end_line>
I thought my ability to provide you stability<end_line>
Was what was really G, okay silly me<end_line>
I was Billy Dee, smooth cat but really street<end_line>
Really she attract niggaz like the +A Milli+ beat<end_line>
And I happen to rap but somethin 'bout this beat strange<end_line>
Soon as I try to flow with it, the beat change<end_line>
Never thought she change<end_line>
But what you thinks a upgrade really just could be a seat change<end_line>
Love changes<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
See when the love is gone then it's just B.S. left<end_line>
Just niggaz with chains on tryin to be S.F.<end_line>
That's when your ace boom coom ya B.F.F.<end_line>
Who Pachange ya like they was a P.F. chef<end_line>
+D-D-D-Danger+, it just feels Mystikal<end_line>
I miss the cool nights sittin in the Carlo<end_line>
Now it's like "boooo" we sittin in Apollo<end_line>
It used to be all good, then shit just went malo<end_line>
And that's bad, matter fact that's sad<end_line>
'Cause when you lose a friend it's hard to handle the loss<end_line>
They do some bitch shit, gotta give ya man a divorce<end_line>
End up watchin "Friends" like Joey, Chandler and Ross<end_line>
Ya see, most of these niggaz ain't never love 'em<end_line>
And these bitches just think whatever of 'em<end_line>
So maybe playin dumb was kinda clever of 'em<end_line>
And less friends are your best friends become strangers<end_line>
<verse_end>
