I got the Yankee leaning, just sittin over to browse<end_line>
And the G4 is just getting over the clouds<end_line>
You can't tell me that I ain't what's up right now<end_line>
I got a bottle of Tequila upside down<end_line>
There's some chicks wit boyfriends that are up tight now<end_line>
Cause they know the big 'dog' had a 'pups' like wow<end_line>
I'm stuck in my city ways<end_line>
Heading over seas wit a zip of New York City's haze<end_line>
You rats can keep running through your city's maze<end_line>
Until you get sprayed with the pesticide<end_line>
I know you in that hole, you best to hide<end_line>
Like the rest who tried, who went and testified<end_line>
Of course your girl wanna slide over and be rubbed<end_line>
And don't mind taking rides over the G dubs<end_line>
I ride Rovers on Spre-dubs<end_line>
Please don't be another dude who died over a ski dub, chill<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I get it jumping like a lo lo '64<end_line>
And bet they hop on it like a pogo stick pro<end_line>
I'm chilling wit these go go chicks though<end_line>
That do the kind of things that belong in a porno flick yo<end_line>
You know it's him and the gang<end_line>
Wit the bling worked on, that remind you of lemon meringue<end_line>
But remember the thangs, ain't too far<end_line>
And y'all wanna hear em go bang bang bang<end_line>
Like John Witherspoon, I'm watching em closely<end_line>
I know the snakes gon' slither soon<end_line>
The two toned Maybach's getting delivered soon<end_line>
The back feels like sitting in the living room<end_line>
I'm so hard bodied like the suit on Batman<end_line>
It's that man that back to back plat' scan<end_line>
I'm back for the third time, I make words rhyme for a living<end_line>
You probably heard I'm still ghetto, nigga!<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
They tried to put two 9's on me, just like Gretzky<end_line>
But my lawyer saw through it just like wet tees<end_line>
I smoke till my eyes look just like Jet Li's<end_line>
On islands where the water's blue just like Pepsi<end_line>
Yeah the trigger just might get squeezed<end_line>
And the slugs will skip over your waves, just like jet skis<end_line>
Hoes know Ghetto from New York, call em the Fresh Prince<end_line>
And throw rose petals when I walk<end_line>
They love how I came back hard like good blow<end_line>
And I'm still a heart throb to a hood ho<end_line>
That's what hood though, yes I would know<end_line>
That's cause I'm in the streets like man hole covers<end_line>
Rims look like blades when a fan blow brother<end_line>
I'm waiting on a storm to land, roast others<end_line>
The man no other, cause I been in it<end_line>
My time is money, y'all couldn't buy ten minutes<end_line>
I'm gone! catch up!<end_line>
<verse_end>
