<verse_start>
I'm waitin on my green like I'm sittin at a red light<end_line>
Yeah the big nigga better have my bread right<end_line>
Heard if the head right, nigga there e'ry night<end_line>
Saw him outside in the ride, no headlights<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Got the semi 9 with the red light<end_line>
He gon' give me mine, or he dead aight?<end_line>
It's a dead night and nobody on the block<end_line>
In the morning John Doe body on the block<end_line>
I went crazy on the day I got the fuckin call<end_line>
This nigga and his bitch shoppin in the fuckin mall<end_line>
I'm blowin up his phone, pussy nigga duckin calls<end_line>
Spendin my money on his slut who suckin balls<end_line>
Heard the nigga club poppin bottle after bottle<end_line>
Whatever car he in, that's what Rollo have to follow<end_line>
Can't wait to walk up, pop him hollow after hollow<end_line>
Pass me that shit son, now here this nigga go<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I caught him walkin out the building slow, quickly I draw the toast<end_line>
Shoulda saw his face, looked like he saw a ghost<end_line>
He kept backin up, I'm tryin to draw him close<end_line>
He's sayin "Chill! I know what I got for you Los'"<end_line>
"Give me a little time, a nigga got jammed in jail"<end_line>
"You know my fam Jamel, look like Sam Casell"<end_line>
"Got an op with like 900 grams a scale"<end_line>
"On 7-5 North, Alabama sale"<end_line>
I don't know the nigga, don't give a damn as well<end_line>
You no +Negotiator+ and I ain't Samuel<end_line>
I squeeze two then the chamber got jammed with shells<end_line>
And they say life is a gamble well<end_line>
Guess today was his lucky day<end_line>
He gotta move now, I know where the fuck he stay<end_line>
Taste his little chicken fried the Kentucky way<end_line>
Bet if I flash that, she know where the stash at<end_line>
<verse_end>
