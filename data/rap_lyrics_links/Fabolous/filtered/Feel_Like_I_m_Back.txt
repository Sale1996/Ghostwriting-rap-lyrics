Hey, hey, hey, hey<end_line>
I take it in, I blow it out<end_line>
On the courthouse steps after they throw it out<end_line>
Bentley waitin by the curb, I spur it out<end_line>
Doors don't open they selves, the chauffeur get out<end_line>
My exhale made everything a foggy blur<end_line>
I make my way through the reporters and photographers<end_line>
I take my lady's hand, I shake my attorney's<end_line>
Then slide in the back seat and let's begin this journey<end_line>
Told the driver hold on 'fore we pushed out<end_line>
I let my window down, out comes a kush cloud<end_line>
Any last words?, justice has been served<end_line>
Now back to the streets that's what the hustlers deserve<end_line>

<verse_start>
Hey, hey, hey, hey<end_line>
I ain't lose a step, I ain't miss a beat<end_line>
Thugs have emotions, we miss the streets<end_line>
We kiss the heat, we love the block<end_line>
We rubberband the money, we black glove the glock<end_line>
I'm screamin free at last, free at last<end_line>
She used to send me pictures, so I could see that ass<end_line>
That's real talk, that's a real bitch<end_line>
As fly as I left, the mink still fit<end_line>
They know my name but in case they didn't know so<end_line>
Appear in a casket courtesy of Loso<end_line>
So, you should have your shit packed<end_line>
I'm a need ya to not be here when I get back, yeah<end_line>

<verse_start>
Hey, hey, hey, hey<end_line>
Hey daddy's home, after a long day<end_line>
I'm from the hood, I came a long way<end_line>
But I ain't goin back, I'm just visitin<end_line>
I hear the streets talkin, I'm just listenin<end_line>
If they ain't talkin money, I'm out my business then<end_line>
If that ain't what it is, then what is it then?<end_line>
I'm out here grizzyin, Swizzyin<end_line>
+It's Me Bitches+, sittin in a Phantom<end_line>
Got the streets back but I didn't pay the ransom<end_line>
A father who fathered you, shit you like my grandson<end_line>
I came back for it like I left it nigga<end_line>
You try me you get more than a 'E' for effort nigga<end_line>
