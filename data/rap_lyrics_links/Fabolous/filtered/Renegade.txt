<verse_start>
I ain't mad at when it rain, cause I know the sun is somewhere shinin<end_line>
Sorta like some clear diamonds<end_line>
I hardly see my moms, but she know her son is somewhere grindin<end_line>
Some where rhymin, or somewhere climbing<end_line>
Out of a pottable 760, inclasable very sticky<end_line>
Wit a handgun, to send these cowards to Heaven quickly<end_line>
I ain't pussy, so I won't allow you to ever dick me<end_line>
I know these greaseballs, wonder how could they ever stick me<end_line>
But I move, like the President through town<end_line>
Wit stones the size of earrings, in my Presidential crown<end_line>
I put hollows from the Desert into clowns, cause the cemetary<end_line>
Is where most of the dudes, that are hesitant are found<end_line>
So I take the time, of whatever the bench throw<end_line>
The 4BM put down, in a seventy-two inch hole<end_line>
Mean while getting adapted, to the fame has be hectic<end_line>
But I'm fucking like I'm tryna take down Chamberlain's record<end_line>
And the girls more than like you, when you running run<end_line>
Doing world tours like Michael, but girl's sure don't like you<end_line>
You going on like thirty-six, flowin on some berry mix<end_line>
The little money you get, you blowing on them dirty chicks<end_line>
Tryna look young, so you throwing on the jersey quick<end_line>
I'm on my second V-12, you going on ya thirty-six<end_line>
You can look at this rider, and see I'm on the come-up<end_line>
Cause I pass the hitch-hikers, like I don't see 'em with they thumb up<end_line>
I just turn the system up and keep boppin<end_line>
I never get, where I'm tryna go, if a nigga keep stoppin<end_line>
And I tell the cops, this joint is for protection<end_line>
Don't they see when I come through, how these people point in my direction<end_line>
That's why I poke out my jeans, like my joint with a erection<end_line>
Till I'm in a joint made for correction<end_line>
And right now, the way rapper bi'ness spread<end_line>
It wouldn't even surprise me, if one of these rappers is a Fed, nigga<end_line>
