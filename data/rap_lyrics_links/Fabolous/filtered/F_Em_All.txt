I said, fuck 'em all, motherfuck 'em all<end_line>
Cause I shot so much I smell like the fuckin mall<end_line>
It's so many guns ain't nowhere to tuck 'em all<end_line>
And you might dodge one, let me see you duck 'em all<end_line>
No way, no how, shit I know that<end_line>
Almost as much as I know O.J.'ll blow trial<end_line>
I be in the club, Rose, no smile<end_line>
Few pretty chicks like "Okay can we go now?"<end_line>
I must be the niggy<end_line>
I run in your house, snatch your lil' russy and diggy<end_line>
It's nothin no biggy, and if I hafto I do it myself<end_line>
I'm feelin like a Puff with no Biggie<end_line>
Now these joker niggaz OD'n pullin a huge head<end_line>
So I'ma kill a cow, make sure that the beef's dead<end_line>
Burger-ass niggaz, I look further past niggaz<end_line>
