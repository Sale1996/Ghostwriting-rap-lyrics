<verse_start>
I'm ridin through the metropolitan, everybody hollerin<end_line>
Me I'm just acknowledgin, with this million dollar grin<end_line>
Shine like a halogen, cool as the island wind<end_line>
I don't judge myself but if I do I'd give my style a ten<end_line>
Met a chick, who belong, on front of Cosmopolitan<end_line>
Thick in the right place, otherwise she model thin<end_line>
She don't do no swallowin, but she got a wilder friend<end_line>
Who don't give a fuck, I told both of them to follow then<end_line>
I'm with the familiar, you might be familiar<end_line>
with a few faces but they still the nine milli-a<end_line>
They be like the Young Guns, so I guess I'm Billy bruh<end_line>
I do more than William Bryant, I'm a little Willie-er<end_line>
Change a little chillier, wrist a little sillier<end_line>
And I'm grown, so I'm not, really the, kid at all<end_line>
But I hope you get it y'all, I can't say I did it all<end_line>
But believe that 'fore I leave it I'ma try to get it all<end_line>
What I don't get at all, is what these critics call<end_line>
stuntin, don't mean nuttin, they don't live her like they read it y'all<end_line>
It ain't the car, it's the way it's kitted y'all<end_line>
Meanin it's the little things, like the way my fitted fall<end_line>
The way my posture lean, the way my necklace hang<end_line>
You should respect this gang, if not expect this bang<end_line>
But all this wreckless slang, it don't effect us mayne<end_line>
They build you up to break you down, it's just like Tetris mayne~!<end_line>
That's why I sex Ms. Thang, and let the next miss hang<end_line>
And even if I wake up late I do the breakfast thang<end_line>
That's an important meal, I is the important deal<end_line>
Jay brought me to Def Jam, feel like it's Jordan deal<end_line>
I'm young mellow game-winning young fellow<end_line>
Remember me, I mixed one white with one yellow<end_line>
Turned nuttin into somethin, you can do it too<end_line>
This the music that you do it to, 'Lo-so<end_line>
