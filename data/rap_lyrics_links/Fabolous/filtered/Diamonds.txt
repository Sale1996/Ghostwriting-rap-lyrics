<verse_start>
I turn my dark secrets, into bright ideas<end_line>
I used to cry for help, I learned to wipe my tears<end_line>
I was scared to embrace but now I fight my fears<end_line>
These hoes say I'm too much it's only right I share<end_line>
Pressure makes diamonds, I was made to shine<end_line>
When Life gave me lemons I made lemonade with mine<end_line>
What's beef? Beef is when you make mistakes<end_line>
Like less burgers with yo' buddies and mo' steaks with snakes<end_line>
My story just gets better, when you get to the end<end_line>
So when I'm at my worst, I know it's not the end<end_line>
I came from the dirt made the cut in blue<end_line>
So when you put me in that right light what I do?<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I'm shinnin religiously, Jesus pieces and crosses<end_line>
I paid for all of my toys I don't owe any Santa Claus's<end_line>
I never finished school or completed no college courses<end_line>
Was taught to be a winner but I learned more from my losses <end_line>
Losses like, when you go, is yo' friends 'gone miss you?<end_line>
Was it 'cause you beneficial or you been official?<end_line>
Condo at the top one floor down from heaven yo!<end_line>
Hatin is beneath me, I say that's the devil yo!<end_line>
I'm tryin to keep the faithHangin there with hope<end_line>
Until my jeweler bought myself two angels on a rope<end_line>
I came from the dirt made the cut in blue<end_line>
So when you put me in that right light what I do?<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Could say I always was the truth but that be lyin a little<end_line>
You can't spell believe without a lie in the middle<end_line>
I always say it first, niggas tryin to ditto<end_line>
But I got bigger shit to do than to try and belittle <end_line>
Mind of a general, heart of a soldier<end_line>
That just mean I call the shots but I ain't afraid to take a shot<end_line>
Niggas gave it all they got still couldn't take my spot<end_line>
Don't get yo' shorty got and have to live out take his plot<end_line>
I ain't give a fuck now I would give whatever<end_line>
You only live once but legacies live forever<end_line>
I came from the dirt made the cut in blue<end_line>
So when you put me in that right light what I do?<end_line>
