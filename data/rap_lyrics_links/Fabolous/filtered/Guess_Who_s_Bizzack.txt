Wasn't just listenin you let that shit taint you<end_line>
You fell out like thanks do I lost all respect<end_line>
For niggas that's bitches so don't call or text<end_line>
Them bitches get checked, like they all correct<end_line>
But they be wrong that's their called your ex<end_line>
You know talk is cheap, so why call direct?<end_line>
And you niggas broke, y'all call collect<end_line>
