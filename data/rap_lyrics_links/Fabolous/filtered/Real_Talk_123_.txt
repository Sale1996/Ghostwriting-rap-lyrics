They ain't walkin' the walk, they just talkin' the talk<end_line>
Some people look at me as the real talk of New York<end_line>
I ain't these like these niggaz who be feinin' to front<end_line>
Like they the first to ever put green in a blunt<end_line>
Look I don't be meaning to stunt, but I zip down like jeans in the front<end_line>
In somethin' that you seen and you want<end_line>
But otherwise I'm cool wit' it<end_line>
They say only the ones who never had gon' get and act a fool wit' it<end_line>
Everybodys' gangsta through the promotion<end_line>
Even if they raised in a house wit' a view of the ocean<end_line>
The bangers is growin' upset<end_line>
Cuz' ya' ass is on t.v. throwin' up sets<end_line>
And you know you ain't like that<end_line>
But you'll say that you is<end_line>
Go and rent a bunch a shit and and then say that its his<end_line>
You ain't a pimp or you wouldn't go to dinner wit' groupies<end_line>
Ain't a baller cuz' you wouldn't put spinners on hoopties<end_line>

How can niggaz say they be on the other side of the seas'<end_line>
Where the steering wheels are on the other side of the v's<end_line>
And the home look like the spot on the other side of the c's<end_line>
When they ain't never been on the other side of the p's<end_line>
I ca' see through em', ya tents are too light<end_line>
Every sentence you write is far from the truth<end_line>
You wanna be that nigga you are in the booth<end_line>
But you ain't got the heart, the scars, or the proof<end_line>
And now you flash ya' shirt tag in our grill<end_line>
But I'm hearin' you was a dirtbag before the deal<end_line>
You walk around talkin' how every dime sucked<end_line>
When they don't even speak to you, nevermind fucked you<end_line>
Ya' hood sayin' don't come back<end_line>
Step foot in here, and they gon' put you where you won't come back<end_line>
Dog, how the fuck you gon' have keys in ya' house<end_line>
When ya' moms' won't even give you keys to the house loser<end_line>

<verse_start>
Nigga you in the mirror, checkin' what your make ups' lookin' like<end_line>
Tryina fool the world wit' a Jacob look-a-like<end_line>
Jiving like you hold stacks<end_line>
But ya' car is ten years old homie, ya' drivin' in a throwback<end_line>
They gon' strip you, have you runnin' naked next<end_line>
Without security you like unprotected sex<end_line>
You ain't never gon' finger a trigger<end_line>
All you do is look in the mugshot book and finger a nigga<end_line>
I real recognize real, you'd be a john doe<end_line>
You livin' in a closet and call it a condo<end_line>
I don't member you as a slinger that was on the bench<end_line>
Just a little scrub ass ringer in the tournaments<end_line>
Now they try to blame the fall of hip hop on fans<end_line>
Nah, I think its these hip hop con mans<end_line>
Studio gangstas is played out now<end_line>
This ain't the eighties, battle raps'll get you layed out<end_line>
