My daddy left me and he ain't even die<end_line>
So when he did go, I ain't even cry<end_line>
I had reason but that ain't even why<end_line>
How could he have failed, if he ain't even try?<end_line>
I ask no questions, I ain't even pry<end_line>
Truthfully I wanted to, I can't even lie<end_line>
Like a canceled flight, that ain't even fly<end_line>
To just walk away, like you ain't even my<end_line>
Like, like, like, I ain't even your<end_line>
I can't even say it, I ain't even sure<end_line>
He should of gave me everything and left me even more<end_line>
But he left me without saying what he was leavin for<end_line>
And that's when I became a man<end_line>
And that's the day he stopped bein one<end_line>
This year I became a father<end_line>
And I'm a die bein one, what's up son?<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I have nightmares of me not bein around<end_line>
He took his first steps and daddy couldn't be in town<end_line>
Daddy's entertaining everybody<end_line>
But missed out when it came to trainin for the potty<end_line>
I give a fuck about hip-hop's new beef<end_line>
I was more excited when my son grew teeth<end_line>
So I seem the problem of the famous stardom<end_line>
Just like Em and Hailie, just like Game and Harlem<end_line>
Weezy's at the Awards with Ms. Carter<end_line>
Nah not his date, I'm talkin about his daughter<end_line>
Now that's +Stuntin' Like Your Daddy+<end_line>
'Cause it's crazy when you wanna be nothin like your daddy<end_line>
And if you've never been a man<end_line>
That's the day you start bein one<end_line>
This year I became a father<end_line>
And I'm a die bein one, what's up son?<end_line>
<verse_end>
