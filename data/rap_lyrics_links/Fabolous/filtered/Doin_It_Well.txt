Body language is the kind of talk I'm fluent in<end_line>
Why don't you stop talkin' 'bout it and come do it then?<end_line>
Written on your face, that "Yeah I'm tryna do it" grin <end_line>
Event plannin', we just need a spot to do it in<end_line>
Headin' to engagements, head behind the Range tints <end_line>
Fruits of my labor, edible arrangements<end_line>
It get a little messy, sweater new, Jay's mint<end_line>
She say when she done with me, I better go and change them<end_line>
Fuck the sweater, I don't know no fuckin' better<end_line>
Y'all don't get it, I don't know no fuckin' better<end_line>
Then this right here, shawty right there<end_line>
Still givin' ol' boy nightmares <end_line>
And I heard your ex hate it, that's why my texts stated <end_line>
Last night was a movie and it was X-rated<end_line>
Flick called "Wet", it only gets better <end_line>
Tonight we make the sequel, and call that shit Wetter<end_line>

Mm; I'ma call you big daddy and scream your name<end_line>
Only if you have me drippin' like candy paint <end_line>
Mmm, daddy slow down a bit <end_line>
You actin' like you never been downtown and shit <end_line>
I need a baller laid back while he watch this thing bounce <end_line>
Buyin' him designer bags, one milli in my account<end_line>
If you gon' do it, do it for real<end_line>
