... We all have situationships<end_line>
... Good sex, bad relationships<end_line>
Had dinner dates, had vacation trips<end_line>
Now the respect is lost, the admiration dips<end_line>
... And all we do is fuckin' argue<end_line>
... Yeah, that's it: fuck and argue<end_line>
Why have somebody lyin' wit' me every night<end_line>
if they just gon' be lyin' to me every night?<end_line>
I'm tryin' but I'm never right, buyin' shit you never liked<end_line>
Two wrongs just make us wrong, why even be together right?<end_line>
We used to be lovers, now we used to each other<end_line>
Keep accusin' each other of us using the other<end_line>
And what's crazy is soon as you fall back, they crawl back<end_line>
Sayin' they sorry and want it all back<end_line>
How do I get myself in these situations<end_line>
Good thing I know...<end_line>

Titles ain't shit, if the story don't match it<end_line>
Now you got a itch lookin' for a away to scratch it<end_line>
Flirting online hopin' shorty don't catch it<end_line>
In the strip club, you do it for the ratchets<end_line>
Meanwhile discussin' turn into fussin'<end_line>
Name callin' and cussin'; the person you put your trust in<end_line>
You tryna take back something you already said<end_line>
That's like giving CPR to something already dead<end_line>
And it is what it is or it is what it isn't<end_line>
The comfort to us, is no longer sufficient<end_line>
But I hit it well and in public I didn't yell<end_line>
We got everybody fooled, but I think the kids could tell<end_line>
That the situation ain't the best it ain't the worst<end_line>
It's been times that I felt like this, it ain't my first<end_line>
That alone got me like try harder, or why bother<end_line>
One thing I know...<end_line>
<verse_end>
