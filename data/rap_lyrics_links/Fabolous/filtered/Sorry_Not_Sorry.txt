I'm way too different to treat the same <end_line>
You still playin', I already beat the game <end_line>
I'm not with the break up, the make up shit<end_line>
I'm on some wake up and cake up shit<end_line>
So, no apologies, just a pile of G's <end_line>
Make stacks for my niggas, all my pals are G's<end_line>
Tryna to kick it, I don't like your soccer <end_line>
Curve a chick like a lipo doctor, hah~!<end_line>
<verse_end>

Ay, look<end_line>
You could've been and you would've been<end_line>
You get it now but you never understood it then <end_line>
News bulletin, yup, all our bullets tins<end_line>
I'ma pull a Benz up, pocket full of bands <end_line>
What's up, with them get back texts?<end_line>
Yes we wasn't workin' out, time to get back flexin'<end_line>
Same phone, "Who's this?" Yeah I switched up on you <end_line>
What happened to old boy, oh he bitched up on you?<end_line>
Now she want to ride stick, tryna witch up on you<end_line>
When I do want to cut, I hit Rich up on you<end_line>
He came through with Tiller, I'm posted with killer<end_line>
Hit Relly like I'm with the young nigga young nigga<end_line>
And now it's T R A P S O U L with the boy who rap S.O.U.L<end_line>
Tapes in the winter like it's Thanksgiving dinner<end_line>
Like it's Christmas spirit, got a gift with lyrics<end_line>
You niggas stay far from me 'til your bitch get near it, huh<end_line>
