You got to take the good with the bad<end_line>
Love what you got, remember what you had<end_line>
Always forgive but never forget<end_line>
Learn from mistakes, but never regret<end_line>
I feel like it's coming it just ain't never done yet<end_line>
You wanna take off, go head rev up the jet<end_line>
Ain't gotta act like our paths should had never met<end_line>
Let's be happy apart instead of together upset<end_line>
I got the least out of something I put the most into<end_line>
It's fucked up when assholes are who we toasting to<end_line>
You remind me of somebody that I used to know<end_line>
Me and that other you, weren't introduced before<end_line>
And I don't like that bitch<end_line>
We go from belly<end_line>
I don't like that shit<end_line>
Who's gonna fill your space<end_line>
That's still a case<end_line>
Ben Franks the only familiar face<end_line>
Get money<end_line>

I guess she forgot how I used to hold her<end_line>
The nights she was goin through it<end_line>
Crying on my shoulder<end_line>
And did a 360 it's like she got colder<end_line>
I'm starting to regret all the things that I showed her<end_line>
But I'm a rider<end_line>
She used to be my roller<end_line>
I guess the general just lost his best soldier<end_line>
I thought I felt some type of bond and got close to her<end_line>
She mean to me more<end_line>
Cuz ya boy a ghost to her<end_line>
