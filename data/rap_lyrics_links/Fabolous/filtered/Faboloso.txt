Mida, allow me to introduce myself, I'm known as Faboloso<end_line>
When it's time to slide, I'm known to grab the most hoes<end_line>
When I climb inside, they known to grab me close though<end_line>
When it's time to ride, I'm known to grab the toast though<end_line>
By the expression on these hotties grill<end_line>
I can tell that wanna holla at somebody real<end_line>
And I'm usually looking for somebody skilled<end_line>
Enough to make a nigga scream Ayayayo<end_line>
Niggas get mad, cause I may slay they hoe<end_line>
But I don't wanna let these AK strays go<end_line>
Stop face fightin' me, like ya face frighten me<end_line>
Besides, what I need wit another case fightin' me<end_line>
Nigga what I need is a ounce of good cronic<end_line>
Unbelievable amounts of hypnotic<end_line>
A shorty wit a ass that bounce like hydraulics<end_line>
And a nigga is straighter than six o-clock<end_line>
