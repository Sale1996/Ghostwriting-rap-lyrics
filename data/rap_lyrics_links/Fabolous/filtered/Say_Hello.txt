Fuck I need with another chain?<end_line>
My nigga Raj just seen his brother slain<end_line>
I'm tryin to feel the brother pain<end_line>
Cause I know it's no way I could get another Caine<end_line>
Bad thoughts be on a brother brain<end_line>
I'ma ride, I'm just in another lane<end_line>
Can't stand to see my mother strained<end_line>
or stressed over all the bullshits of the game<end_line>
So, I'm with dark-skinned Lorraine<end_line>
Parked in the Range, sparks in my chains<end_line>
Yeah, I've been marked in the fame<end_line>
That's why the lenses are dark in my frames<end_line>
Tryin to clean dirt marks from my name<end_line>
I ignore remarks from your lames<end_line>
I know Brooklyn got my back<end_line>
My rearview's the only way that I am lookin back<end_line>
to hello, uh, say hello, uh<end_line>
To L.O., uh, to L.O.S.O.<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I think my girl gon' have to find another nigga<end_line>
I'm tryin to tell her I am not that other nigga<end_line>
When I met her she was with another nigga<end_line>
She must still think that I'm the other nigga<end_line>
Before her head got bigger<end_line>
Before that shit we was Beyonce and Jigga<end_line>
I can't complain and say that she a gold digger<end_line>
But like 'Ye said, she ain't fuckin with broke niggaz<end_line>
But tell me have you ever lost somethin nigga?<end_line>
It's like the stage coach turned into a pumpkin<end_line>
She be tryin to judge me, without a gavel and a robe<end_line>
But she ain't been nowhere and I done been around the globe<end_line>
They see me ridin young cold<end_line>
And the diamonds in my lobes, shine brighter than strobes<end_line>
... then again<end_line>
My swag kicks in, that's when the bad guy begins<end_line>
Say hello, uh, say hello, uh<end_line>
To L.O., uh, to L.O.S.O.<end_line>
<verse_end>
