<verse_start>
I'm old enough to know better, young enough to not give a fuck<end_line>
Rather hold my head high and die, then live and duck<end_line>
I gotta' +Set It Off+ -- Jada, Queen and Vivica<end_line>
The last chick was scared to get that money, I can't live like her<end_line>
Got no problem with you niggas, get it how you live it, bruh<end_line>
It's a cold world, these mean streets will shiver ya<end_line>
All I asks is for the same respect that I be givin' ya<end_line>
If not my boy will put the +Beats+ on you -- Karen Civil ya<end_line>
That boy be on his shoot first, never mind the trivia<end_line>
My advice, +Don't Mess With His Man+, word to Nivea<end_line>
We go back to when we got that white from Bolivia<end_line>
We was +Candy Shoppin'+ before 50 and Olivia<end_line>
That's when you would go uptown, cause you had to re' there<end_line>
Everybody broke back then, you had to repair<end_line>
Drug dealing was cool back then, you had to beware<end_line>
That was the 90's, ya'll wouldn't get it, you had to be there<end_line>
That's why I'm glad to be here, some of us never made it<end_line>
It's hard to get off the ground, ya'll think I just levitated?<end_line>
Ya'll think it was all love and nobody ever hated?<end_line>
Y'all think cause I never state it I never been devastated?<end_line>
All ya'll see is sunshinin', think I was never shaded<end_line>
Ya' think these calendar models is all that I ever dated<end_line>
Nigga, +Nothing Was The Same+, HOT 97 played it<end_line>
Everyday they made it that I stayed with 57 plated<end_line>
Can't trust nobody, the crib is heavy gated<end_line>
You ask why? I tell them even heaven's gated<end_line>
You know why? Cause when you good, the Devil hate it<end_line>
And even if you heavy weighted people want you feather weighted<end_line>
Attention I never payed it, me and this clever lady<end_line>
She brains, do some thangs, then we lay together faded<end_line>
And while I chill, loaded up a steel<end_line>
Just wishin' a nigga would but knowin' a nigga will<end_line>
But for real nigga good is how you feel<end_line>
But soon as a nigga good is as soon as a nigga will<end_line>
Still, I don't owe these niggas nothing<end_line>
Put that in a nigga will<end_line>
