<verse_start>
And I ain't gotta tell y'all who I be<end_line>
'Cause these hundred hundred dollar bills are like Baller ID<end_line>
And I get under niggaz skin, they should call me IV<end_line>
But if you try me nigga I will be your caller ID<end_line>
And that means I got your number, please don't make me dial it<end_line>
That could land your fly ass on the ground, just like a pilot<end_line>
So just do me a solid, y'all stay in pocket like wallets<end_line>
'Cause you can't see me, closed eye lids<end_line>
Huh, nighty night<end_line>
I'm with a model chick, Tyra thick, Heidi's height<end_line>
Body suits, body tight<end_line>
Yeah, I clean up nice, catch me on a tidy night<end_line>
Might be Gucci'd down to the tighty whites<end_line>
Okay it's Loso, everybody know so<end_line>
My son is the heir to the throne, Prince Joso<end_line>
So daddy need money, mami need new Trueies<end_line>
Baby need shoes, preferably the new Louis'<end_line>
The swagger's in his genes, he was born fly<end_line>
Them Philly bitches say the ball keep his jaw fly<end_line>
The Reggie Kush out of Southern Californ-i<end_line>

<verse_start>
Hush little lame niggaz, don't say a word<end_line>
Y'all don't know the half, not even a third<end_line>
Put a dick in your ear and fuck what ya heard<end_line>
She tried to pull my fly south, I ain't want the bird<end_line>
'Cause I've been killin these hoes, these niggaz just drop dead<end_line>
In the drop head, all we do is bop head<end_line>
To the side like Busta in the Pepsi ad<end_line>
With my Colombiana mama, yep she bad<end_line>
She in the latest shoe that Giuseppe had<end_line>
Blow game like the late Dizzy Gillespie had<end_line>
That's some good jaw, pop quiz, good score<end_line>
She call her pussy meriene, that good raw<end_line>
For you little cheap fucks, hood whores<end_line>
You niggaz soft in the middle, call 'em hood smores<end_line>
Everybody on the block goin cuckoo<end_line>
Phantom doors open like the clock that goes "cuckoo"<end_line>
Birds poppin out, sittin on the hood<end_line>
Check my bird droppings out, I'm shittin on the hood<end_line>
Sleepy time niggaz<end_line>
The hand that rocks the cradle for you nursery rhyme niggaz<end_line>
It's bed time<end_line>
