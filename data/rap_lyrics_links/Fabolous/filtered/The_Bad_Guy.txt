<verse_start>
I guess I'm the bad guy<end_line>
The fingers is pointing<end_line>
Nigga, I don't go in no clubs without bringing my joint in<end_line>
They be asking fellas why<end_line>
It's cause the streets is watching<end_line>
With an envious ear, jealous eye<end_line>
You know how William H. Bonnie's rockin<end_line>
I keep the home phone and two way contact to Johnny Cochran<end_line>
Be the same dudes, testing your patience<end_line>
In them hospitals, resting like patients, confessing to agents<end_line>
You smell me, you gotta spray the Wesson like fragrance<end_line>
And you pay your way out arrests and arraignments<end_line>
These playas been playin' foul<end_line>
And I done learned my lesson with flagrants<end_line>
Nigga, this how I live it ain't just entertainment<end_line>
I'm what they been trying to do, not do<end_line>
I'm the kid, they been lying to you<end_line>
You need people like me<end_line>
I'm so F-A, B-O, L-O, U-S<end_line>
Yeah, that's the bad guy<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Bitches think all they gotta do is say the child is Sports<end_line>
Quit they job and live off the child support<end_line>
How could you stand there, smile in court<end_line>
I'ma just settle, fly back to them Cayman Isle resorts<end_line>
You better sign a pre-nup<end_line>
You catch me instead of 'it wasn't me'<end_line>
I'm gonna say 'where you get a key from?'<end_line>
I love the way your butt swishes<end_line>
But non of these slut bitches<end_line>
is worth me asking my doctor why my nuts itches<end_line>
If they see how the Rolls Royce smell<end_line>
All day I be emptying my in box and my whole voice mail<end_line>
I'll be ready to light the weed and pull it<end_line>
Now every chick want to make me come faster than a speeding bullet<end_line>
But I ain't into coaching birds like Tony LaRussa<end_line>
I done had the thickest chickens to the boniest roosters<end_line>
Who have trouble getting the kid like me to spend<end_line>
Ma you'll never see a bad guy like me again, for real<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Come on<end_line>
What type of bad guy give fellas dap, females hugs<end_line>
I making my business, my kids won't have to retail drugs<end_line>
I get threats over the two way from email thugs<end_line>
I ride with ratchets, clips under the CL rugs<end_line>
Think I'm liking you? Wrong<end_line>
Cause even if I get locked<end_line>
My money won't let me stay on Rikers too long<end_line>
Case dismissed, the DA even liking the song<end_line>
Right back to the P's, latest pair of Michael's shoes on<end_line>
When you holla in the club it's cool<end_line>
But don't change the subject fool<end_line>
And start askin if I remember you from public school<end_line>
You know I done heard dozens, of these birds buzzing<end_line>
Talking 'bout I used to fuck with they 3rd cousin<end_line>
FYI, stay the fuck from 'round me<end_line>
??? guys who want to hear somebody stuck or clown me<end_line>
I don't care what other haters do<end_line>
But if you think I'm loved for saving you<end_line>
Say goodnight to the bad guy<end_line>
