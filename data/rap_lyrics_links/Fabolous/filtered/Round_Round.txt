And they say what comes around goes around<end_line>
So the cristal rolls ya down til it slows ya down<end_line>
I got a smoother style<end_line>
Fo me it's +Slow Motion+ like Juvenile<end_line>
'Til I pass through ya areas<end_line>
The SLR, class lookin' serious, they has to be curious<end_line>
You never seen one of the nastiest lyricist<end_line>
Speed through like he in the +Fast and the Furious+<end_line>
Like Pharrell, we stand on bars<end_line>
Girls on us like a fan on stars<end_line>
500 Grand on cars, you'll see a man on Mars<end_line>
Before a nigga lay a hand on ours<end_line>
Catch me in a Diamond chain and a thick cuban<end_line>
In the piece lookin' somethin' like Rick Rubin<end_line>
Put a grin on ya face, then spin in ya waist<end_line>
The world look like it's spinnin' in space<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
What comes around goes back around again<end_line>
And niggaz gon' act up now again<end_line>
And What goes up must come down<end_line>
And I'll be here like What's Up now?<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I do the yankee rockin' wit a lean<end_line>
Know ya can't knock it when ya clean<end_line>
Girls want me on they ass like back pockets on the jeans<end_line>
I just try to plug into the socket in between<end_line>
Then watch me do my step<end_line>
At the same time throwin' up who I rep<end_line>
Street F-F-F-F-Fitted damn<end_line>
No other way to put it to ya ma'am<end_line>
But the look'll say D-D-D-D-Damn<end_line>
I can throw down like a killa<end_line>
Put slugs and banana clips that'll slow down gorillas, Girl<end_line>
Move like you in a Hula Hoop<end_line>
Then blow me like you tryin' to cool ya soup, I'm Hot<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I'm lookin' for a 10 cent wifey<end_line>
Cool as a 10 cent icey<end_line>
That'll fit in vince nicely<end_line>
Let 'em get close<end_line>
Tell 'em play dimmy<end_line>
Imma get swazy, you can get ghost<end_line>
Well, F-A-Beezy, F-A-Sheezy<end_line>
To the press suite at the F-O-Ceezy<end_line>
I'm lookin' at you<end_line>
You lookin' at me<end_line>
Slow down ma, ya speedin' again<end_line>
You can put the top down and blow weed in the wind<end_line>
But fo now, let yo hips go to this<end_line>
Betta yet, let ya lips blow a kiss<end_line>
When I dip low and flip, show the wrist<end_line>
It looks like a froze hypno and cris<end_line>
And I'm in amazing shape<end_line>
With the DR flag on a bathe of apes<end_line>
<verse_end>
