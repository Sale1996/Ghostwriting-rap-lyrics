<verse_start>
When I pulled the 5 out; I kinda expected<end_line>
For the backstabbers, to be standin behind me, wit they knives out<end_line>
Then the Range, wit the fins drove in<end_line>
I wasn't shocked to see my foes, dressed in friends clothin<end_line>
But - I still pull through the sty; wit handguns<end_line>
As big as the one, Robocop pulled from his thigh<end_line>
You prolly heard about the bullets I buy; and how it look like<end_line>
I'm throwin batteries, when the bullets shoot by<end_line>
So what, you wear a vest, why would I care<end_line>
If I aim for ya chest, that be a good idea<end_line>
Nigga, it's nothing to clap ya; but I'm more worried<end_line>
Bout the groupie cops, who wanna put they cuffs on a rappa<end_line>
That's why I'm limpin off wit a freak; and a lawyer<end_line>
Who woulda got O.J. Simpson off in a week<end_line>
I could show you how to blow up on ya own; in a Benz<end_line>
That'll hit a buck! and make the windows go up on they own<end_line>
Wit a stash box compartment for; a handgun<end_line>
That make holes the size of peep holes, on apartment doors<end_line>
My closet look like department stores; and you wonder why<end_line>
Ya girl's comin home, wit a cigar sip for<end_line>
Cause I just dump the light Dutch, mash the guts<end_line>
You won't believe how much ass I touch<end_line>
Who else struts pass the sluts, and a chain wit so much<end_line>
Ash and cuts, that it hangs much pass the nuts<end_line>
That's why I get followed by broads; wit deeper throats<end_line>
Then the people at the circus, that be swallowin swords<end_line>
Y'all hopin that the Don fall off; but my money's long enough<end_line>
To keep shootin ya bank until, ya arms fall off<end_line>
I'm eatin, and I ain't have to use someone's utinsels<end_line>
And when you clean as me, you know that every bum is against you<end_line>
But please don't let someone convince you; to test the kid<end_line>
And get hit wit slugs as long, as a No. 2 Pencil, fucka<end_line>
