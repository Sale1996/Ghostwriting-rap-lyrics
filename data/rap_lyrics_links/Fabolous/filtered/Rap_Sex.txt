Got a condo with nothin' but condoms in it<end_line>
Same place where the rhymes were invented<end_line>
So all I do is rap and sex, imagine how I stroke<end_line>
See how I was flowin' on my last cassette<end_line>
Shawty came through just to hear the mixtape<end_line>
Ended up starrin' in a sex tape<end_line>
With a player from New York no Nicks tape<end_line>
Might need your bitch for my next day<end_line>
I come upstairs then I come get them drawers<end_line>
Come back downstairs then I come up with bars<end_line>
Shit feels so good it might come out tomorrow<end_line>
Beat that shit up, she might come out with scars<end_line>
I do not lie, I been the truth<end_line>
If I'm in her box, I say that I'm in the booth<end_line>
Comin' up with the headlines, that's off the top of the head<end_line>
Heard she nasty on the mic, go for the sloppiest head<end_line>
Then she gon' bust that thing wide, I'ma just let that thing ride<end_line>

No slow jams just street nigga rap, want R&B smooth? Get an R&B dude<end_line>
Got a Range and a Benz, I make R&B moves but I can call Trey, you in an R&B mood?<end_line>
And get him, to the, studio, like "Wassup, this Fab<end_line>
Got a bad bitch with me and she up for grabs"<end_line>
Talkin' 'bout "Ask him what's up with this collab?"<end_line>
And she waitin' at the studio<end_line>
Sign on the door that say "No hatin' at the studio"<end_line>
And I always keep it playa at the studio<end_line>
Every time she ask I say I'm at the studio<end_line>
Layin' somethin' downsee how I was snappin' on my last shit<end_line>
Had to start off with the slow flow<end_line>
Then switch it up to some flat shit<end_line>
Nigga don't make me go Bone Thug your bitch<end_line>
I love this shit but I don't love your bitch<end_line>
