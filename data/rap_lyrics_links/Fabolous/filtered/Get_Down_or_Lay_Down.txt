<verse_start>
Ay yo, it's get down or lay down<end_line>
My shit sound like trey pound<end_line>
Stand up if they G's, sit down if they clowns<end_line>
Get a bitch? I got a bitch<end_line>
She get round, she stay round<end_line>
Girl just wanna have fun, your bitch found a playground<end_line>
I swing by, slide through, see-saw the before<end_line>
Niggaz won't believe this, record the freak raw<end_line>
On the road to riches, these broads get detoured<end_line>
They just firecrackers, we more like C4's<end_line>
Think we talking blowing up, pop a cork and pour it up<end_line>
Life in the fast lane -- you think talk'll slow us up?<end_line>
Nuh-uh, never that, not in this lifetime<end_line>
Thought the game was dead, it just got new lifeline<end_line>
I revived that real shit, y'all deprived from real shit<end_line>
Small hood to all good, we strive like Will Smith<end_line>
Fresh Prince of Bel-Air; flow sick, need health care<end_line>
They ain't got nothing for the kid, I'm gonna need welfare<end_line>
Hell yeah, she down, down like she upset<end_line>
I took her down two months ago, bitch ain't came up yet<end_line>
Money over bitches, dirt on top of bitch niggaz<end_line>
Put you in your place -- it happened to be a ditch, nigga<end_line>
