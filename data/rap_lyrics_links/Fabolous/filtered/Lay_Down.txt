You finally got some off time<end_line>
It's usually Sports Center for the fourth time<end_line>
Tonight you came out of yours and I took off mine<end_line>
Now we finally playing catch, got some back and forth time<end_line>
Tossin' pillows, passin' blunts, caught a buzz<end_line>
First time you gave me head was everything I thought it was, gonna be<end_line>
You ain't got one degree<end_line>
But you'll get a Ph.D for that thing you've done to me<end_line>
And tuggin' your dungaree, I wanted you under me<end_line>
Wanted to spread them legs like you number 23<end_line>
Maybe you wasn't ready, maybe it's under key<end_line>
And it's some for them, and it ain't none for me<end_line>
So we cuddle for a while, talk what you want to be<end_line>
Some things we had in common and movies you want to see<end_line>
He made her run to me, you played with one of these<end_line>
Pretty young girls, ain't no tellin' what she gonna be<end_line>
If she was my girl, might sound sprung of me<end_line>
I'd give her everything like she had a gun to me<end_line>
Yeah, busy man, but for you I'm free<end_line>
Just counting down the days 'til the next time we...<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Your scent light up the truck soon as you hopped in it<end_line>
Easily number one, no matter who the top 10 is<end_line>
In that passenger, no reason for gassin' ya<end_line>
Girl you ain't +Killin' 'Em+, baby it's a massacre<end_line>
Black curly hair, smile with a pearly glare<end_line>
I can take you around the globe, I'm sure the world will stare<end_line>
But tonight we in the city, like J. Lo and Diddy<end_line>
Back in 99, that +Bad Boy+ with pretty<end_line>
A rainy night, the type that make you change your flight<end_line>
But we still fly; ain't nothing plain about us, right?<end_line>
We came to get a bite, blue ribbon for two<end_line>
And I ain't clumsy but I'm so trippin' off you<end_line>
Had sushi for the first time, she tried the king<end_line>
California tempura, ohh you tryin' things?<end_line>
I'm your waiter, I hope you like what I'm trying to bring<end_line>
All you gotta do is the two words Ryan sing<end_line>
Lay down, lay down, hey girl I know my way round<end_line>
Coming down, H-town, ass up, face down<end_line>
Guess we on our way now, I know you can't stay 'round<end_line>
She climbed on top and said look nigga...<end_line>
