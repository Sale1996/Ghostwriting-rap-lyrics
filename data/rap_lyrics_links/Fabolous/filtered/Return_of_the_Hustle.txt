We knock this out homey<end_line>
Street da-da-da-da-damn<end_line>
Ay it's a new year, and I'm back for new money<end_line>
Just I think I left somethin<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Yesss - it's the return of the young hustle<end_line>
A nigga came for the money, not the tongue tussle<end_line>
Me I'd rather do my lip lashin, when the chips cash in<end_line>
Then you might see me on the strip flashin<end_line>
like Vegas lights, and they say I shine Vegas bright<end_line>
Draw a crowd like a Vegas fight<end_line>
So shiiiiiiit, gettin hit in my leg is like<end_line>
I mean it coulda been a 2Pac vegas night<end_line>
Or maybe a Notorious L.A. evening<end_line>
"Baby you okay?" I mean well I'm breathin<end_line>
Hell I'm even, bossin and I left<end_line>
The money ain't right then I toss you to the left<end_line>
Yesss, to the left, to the left<end_line>
Everything is hustle to the death for the F-<end_line>
-A-B baby, they be lazy<end_line>
Gucci straightjacket cause I may be crazy<end_line>
Loony for the loot, psycho for the paper<end_line>
This a new year but I recycle for the paper<end_line>
If green talks, then I'm the Geico with the paper<end_line>
So have my check right, no typos with the paper please<end_line>

<verse_start>
They say the rap game remind 'em of the crack game<end_line>
That's why they money go, quicker than a crack high<end_line>
My money stack high, how high? Shaq high<end_line>
Yao high, that's why, yours is Bow Wow high<end_line>
You lookin at your new hustle, like your last hustle<end_line>
Was looked at as Russell, in my past hustle<end_line>
Shorty work it, she be on her ass hustle<end_line>
She make it clap, she know how to work them ass muscles<end_line>
Fast rush you, then back to the money<end_line>
They say I'm frontin, can't turn my back to the money<end_line>
And truthfully you're cool but I'm attracted to money<end_line>
So why don'tcha turn your back to the money and let it shake<end_line>
I'm lovin how you move that smooth, you let it snake<end_line>
But players don't chase at it baby we let it make<end_line>
Bet it make sense when you make them dollars<end_line>
I ain't gotta make them move, but I make them holla<end_line>
This my year, but y'all can help me celebrate<end_line>
I'm 9:15, that means I'm hella straight<end_line>
Swizz stacks, Just Blaze bucks<end_line>
I'm back for my money, it's just they luck<end_line>
<verse_end>
