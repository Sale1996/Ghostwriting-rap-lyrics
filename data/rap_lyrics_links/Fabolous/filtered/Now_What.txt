<verse_start>
I bet you look at things from a different perspective<end_line>
When you see the size of the slugs, the fifth or the tech get<end_line>
A couple'll lift a detective<end_line>
And make sure the legs that he used to walked with is defective<end_line>
All you niggas do is sit on blocks and jive<end_line>
About who's the baddest bitch and if Pac's alive<end_line>
Nigga, I'm in a aqua five<end_line>
With a button that make the roof flip back like pocket knives<end_line>
I can't knock ya drive, you feelin' like Rocky<end_line>
Till you get a beatin' like he got in Rocky 5<end_line>
The squad'll still hold toast, and get these bitches<end_line>
To open they legs wider than a field goal post<end_line>
Broke niggas don't wanna stand my grind so they knock it<end_line>
Think my jeans got Mickey D's signs on my pockets<end_line>
The hydro combined with, the chocolate have ya eyes<end_line>
Lookin' like the tall dude who signed with the Rockets<end_line>
The flow is so sick, sooner or later<end_line>
These niggas gonna need barf bags bigger than golf bags<end_line>
The coke get flew on planes monthly<end_line>
And cops search me for weapons harder than they do in Hussein country<end_line>
And any chick that get a view of the chain wit me<end_line>
I guess that's what Jay meant by chain reactions<end_line>
Bitch! It's nothin' to thumb off some notes<end_line>
Fuck a dealer, I get 'em when they come off the boat, fucka<end_line>
