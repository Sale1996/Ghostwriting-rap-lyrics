It's easy to look at my life and don't see no pain<end_line>
I remember takin 3, 4 trains to re cocaine<end_line>
Standing in the lobby during sleet, snow, rain<end_line>
Waiting for fiends with a pint of beef lomain<end_line>
Breaking day on the grind, I used to be so drained<end_line>
But ain't a Saturday I wasn't up to see Soul Train<end_line>
Sometimes I ain't see no gain<end_line>
cause I was runnin to Ralphies everytime my trees showed stains<end_line>
I was lucky I ain't seized or maim<end_line>
Get shot or stuck up standin at them cee-lo games<end_line>
But now shit with these skios changed<end_line>
I ain't know why the fuck they used to look at me so strange<end_line>
Glanced at my neck and didn't see no chain<end_line>
Be saying "That's nasty," wouldn't give me no brain<end_line>
Y'all surprised F-A-B-O's sane<end_line>
In my road to life I done jumped in and outta 3, 4 lanes<end_line>
I'm still here<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I just want some peace of mind<end_line>
Niggas will risk havin cuffs on their wrists<end_line>
for this masterpiece on mine<end_line>
Know that I'm a squeeze until the top of my piece recline<end_line>
I can't see myself in back of a Caprice confined<end_line>
But on a small island, too far for police to find<end_line>
With girls who look 'Rican and Guyanese combined<end_line>
I gotta make sure my niece is fine<end_line>
She get every doll for Christmas, new Jordans at Easter-Time<end_line>
Some be like "At least you signed"<end_line>
But that just make is easy to get pointed out at precinct lines<end_line>
All ya'll can see if every piece be dime<end_line>
And I be gettin Nikes before they even get released sometime<end_line>
Youngsters, don't let these videos geese your mind<end_line>
It ain't cool to end up deceased for shine<end_line>
And if you can't get the whole pot, just take a piece and grind<end_line>
Hold your head, your stress will cease in time<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Sometimes I wish I could go way back when<end_line>
I could walk thru and ain't nobody know Jay Jackson<end_line>
Everything was OK back then<end_line>
Now everybody playin a cool role and I know they actin<end_line>
I gotta go back through my ol' way packin<end_line>
These wolves know my jewels is filled with O'Shea Jacksons<end_line>
I don't care as long as my dough stay stackin<end_line>
But these niggas with me be eager to show they Mack 10s<end_line>
And I'm the one the PO's stay trackin<end_line>
Plus I got all these ducks around the ol' way quackin<end_line>
These hoes may crack grins<end_line>
but I swear to God I won't never take O.J's actions<end_line>
If I would've let this flow stay packed in<end_line>
I'd probably be with Nick and 'Rome, spending my whole day shacked in<end_line>
For now I just roll on those eight Jacksons<end_line>
'til Clue and Duro brings those gray plaques in <end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
One day it'll happen<end_line>
That One day I'd be rappin<end_line>
One day it could happen<end_line>
One day I'd be trapped in<end_line>
<verse_end>
