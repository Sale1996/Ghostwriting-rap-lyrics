Same shit different day, just ride through the city, lookin pretty as the usual<end_line>
It's the same old thang, got the name on the chain, just to let 'em know, who's who<end_line>
And they know I've over here, so they come and find me right after they lose you<end_line>
For you niggaz in the way, we can let the guns say - excuse you<end_line>
At the end of the day, we just tryin find our way and I might be a come up<end_line>
And baby you can hitch a ride but you gotta know how to do more than keep a thumb up<end_line>
It's so incredible that it ain't edible but they know the cake's real<end_line>
Yo, I couldn't even say, ask these other silicon niggaz how being fake feel<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Somebody better tell 'em that we in this bitch like an unborn baby<end_line>
See we be everywhere and they ain't never there, couldn't tell you where they be<end_line>
And you already know you ain't gotta ask me you can see that everything is up<end_line>
And I'm so about my money, you ain't talkin about no money<end_line>
you ain't even gotta bring it up<end_line>
And I hope you don't think me give a sugar honey iced tea or a middle finger up<end_line>
I just stay sucker free, leave the lames where they be and I let my chips Pringle up<end_line>
Everybody calm down, there's enough to go around, you just gotta say how much you want<end_line>
Don't know what you're lookin for, unless it's a problem, I promise this ain't what you want<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
, can you do me this favor?<end_line>
Answer this question- y'all gon' try who?<end_line>
See the shoes by Gucci, bag by Louie, the hatin'll be by you<end_line>
And I appreciate the love, thank the man above<end_line>
cause a nigga feel so blessed<end_line>
Yeah and I ain't gonna stop, better get 'em Red Bulls<end_line>
I don't give these haters no rest<end_line>
