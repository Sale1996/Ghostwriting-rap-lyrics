Now we was once two niggaz of the same kind<end_line>
Quick to holla at a bitch with the same lines<end_line>
Quick to draw on a nigga with the same nines<end_line>
But at the same time we was on some diffrent shit<end_line>
Cuz you was with a bitch that I beg to differ wit<end_line>
I told you sniff a bit and you could get a whif of it<end_line>
But you kept a closed nose when it came to those hoes<end_line>
And Im your nigga so I tried to smell em wrong for ya<end_line>
Wasn't there to take the fault for ya, But if you hear me<end_line>
I dedicate this song for ya, He was setup in a stick up<end_line>
By a girl he used to pick up on the upper west side<end_line>
I used to help him chop a brick up, They found him in his pickup<end_line>
Pants down and dick up, Leanin with one in his head<end_line>
And one in his chest, One of the best at this husslin' shit<end_line>
But his downfall was that he put his trust in a bitch and it's fucked up<end_line>

I remember selling three bricks of raw powder<end_line>
Turn my man into a star in 24 hours<end_line>
He didn't care spent the money in like 4 hours<end_line>
on a Benz with like 400 and Horsepower<end_line>
And a chain that had christ on it, a rollie with alot of Ice on it<end_line>
A pinky ring with a price on it, when he come around<end_line>
Its likely that he blunted<end_line>
With a pretty lady in them Nikes that you wanted<end_line>
It's well know he kept it on his hip like a cell phone<end_line>
If you speak with him you can pick up on his jail tone<end_line>
He used to say he wasn't going back without blowing back<end_line>
and now I'm black I wouldn't put it past him<end_line>
The D's would Harass him, til he finally blacked out<end_line>
They told my nigga to freeze, but he still backed out<end_line>
Shots fired 'til his trigger finger got tired<end_line>
All the newspapers said was 'Another Nigga Dead'<end_line>
And it's fucked up<end_line>

You can catch me in a cherry red 8-50 nice ass<end_line>
great titties, face pretty everybody know that she date smitty<end_line>
A big time dealer thats doing a state biddin<end_line>
who did more than his share of dirt in the world<end_line>
enough to make a nigga think about hurtin' his girl<end_line>
so he used to tell his queen to stay to the castle<end_line>
away from the hassle to the day that he pass through<end_line>
There's some enemies he might have who may wanna blast you<end_line>
She stayed for a few years, that's until a few pairs<end_line>
convinced her to come and hang out around New Year's<end_line>
It's been awhile, you can see it in her smile<end_line>
and she ran into her man's Co-Defendant in the trial<end_line>
who started going on about how he moving on<end_line>
about running with them same niggaz Smitty had warned about<end_line>
She slid off told her girl, she had to drop her kid off<end_line>
They found her in the parking lot, somebody blew her lid off<end_line>
and it's fucked up<end_line>
<verse_end>
