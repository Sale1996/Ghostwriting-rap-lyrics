I guess making sure that you good was my bad<end_line>
I kinda thought you had the same feelings I had<end_line>
And you helped sell it like a fly ad<end_line>
But you was mackin at the house, Ipad<end_line>
Not mad, but there's a few disappointments<end_line>
Let's just say that I canceled all the few appointments<end_line>
I blew paper with you, not a joint bitch<end_line>
I say bitch when I'm tryna make a point bitch<end_line>
Other times I call it how I see it<end_line>
I won't give you the title if you don't know how to be it<end_line>
Which proves, I love it when the shits smooth<end_line>
But show yo ass to yo nikka that's a bitch move<end_line>
I'ma ride but what are you about yo<end_line>
You gon pull a Trey and say let me out though<end_line>
Never saw it coming, what a cheap shot<end_line>
Your strongest enemies the one who know ya weak spot<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I kinda wonder if I cross ya mind<end_line>
Maybe you my ex cause you crossed the line<end_line>
Maybe you just never saw the crossing signs<end_line>
Cause the hand up means don't walk<end_line>
We don't talk<end_line>
And somewhere there's a disconnection<end_line>
You take it the wrong way so much misdirection<end_line>
Baby what it is, tell me what it does<end_line>
This is what it is, fuck what it was<end_line>
But it was good while it lasted<end_line>
But when its dead let it go, put it in a casket<end_line>
And don't dig it back up<end_line>
Got my swagga back up<end_line>
I pick up to call you then I hang it back up<end_line>
Yeah, and Imma get back to em<end_line>
To know a backstabber, you gotta turn ya back to em<end_line>
Well maybe its just me and I'm going crazy<end_line>
But let me ask you this<end_line>
Where you going baby?<end_line>
<verse_end>
