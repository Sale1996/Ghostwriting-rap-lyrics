You niggas trying to get noticedI'm here to be remembered<end_line>
Came through in June, they still talking in December<end_line>
Ain't no weak links over here; we all solid, nigga<end_line>
We the Cuban links over here, we don't blink over here <end_line>
We've seen it all and y'all ain't seen shit yet<end_line>
Little niggas trying on my shoes, they don't fit yet<end_line>
When you get shit, guess that's how shit get<end_line>
Trigger finger to your pussies, get your shit wet<end_line>
Straight up, I ain't never been a slouch, nigga<end_line>
And your wifey just hit me; ouch, nigga<end_line>
Putting footprints all up in the couch, nigga<end_line>
Shit these shoes cost more than the couch, nigga<end_line>
