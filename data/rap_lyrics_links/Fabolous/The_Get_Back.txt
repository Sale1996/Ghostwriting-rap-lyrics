[Fabolous]
Who want to bet us that they can't fuck with us?
Stack cheddar forever, live treacherous, all the etceteras
Until the death of us, me and my confidantes, we shine
We make the ambiance, you niggas just rhyme
You little niggas need guidance, you barkin' up the wrong trees
Pissin' on the wrong hydrants; I'm a high fence
I grew up around violence, you grew up playin' violins
In your hood - silence; where I'm from - sirens
They just killed this vibe, they just killed this vibe
There's something about killin' shit that makes us feel alive
We feed off your energy, we see you on that Kenny G
Just tooting your own horn, do your thing my N-I-G
Whenever you "ven aqui" to that mighty NYC
We gon' check that name you claim, bring your {"YAWK!"} and I.D
We take it the wrong way, all gold, everything
One gold watch, two gold chains, give me all those - everything
Y'all don't want to bump heads -- Ocho, Evelyn
Them boys will leave you butt naked, the mall closed and everything
The Streets Is Watching, asking if you gon' reply to them
Seems like I woke up sleeping giants - Eli and them

[Chorus: Fabolous]
A major comeback but from my minor setback
They still don't know we living just thinking about the get back
The get back, the get back, the get back, the get back {*2X*}
I crack a smile knowing God has a day for me
Until that day comes I slay these niggas faithfully
The get back, the get back, the get back, the get back {*2X*}

[Fabolous]
I'm like Nino with the uzi back of the motorcycle heading
to get back at them Italians who killed Keisha at the wedding
I'm like Doughboy lookin' for Ricky's killer - one last soldier
Niggas who turn they backs on me turn your punk ass over
Y'all smoked my cousin Harold, now I'm in the Camaro
Loving and Happiness playin', me and my dog with this double barrel
38, 40 belows, live or die motherfucker
I'm Pac, you Radames "Riverside Motherfucker~!" {*gunshot*}
The get back everybody better get back, tell my niggas in the jet black
Until the seats let back on your jet back, if you're a gamblin' man you could bet that
It's a "sure thing not just a New York thing or a rich or a poor" thing
It's a "lace your boots pull your drawstring who want to go to war" thing
It's a "who gon' protect your thing who really want it more" thing
"Puttin' legends in coffins and some bullet holes in the door" thing
It's a "nobody saw things, street cold not a law" thing
It's "kids that wasn't taught things, old ladies like poor" thing
Poor thing and the get back is impor-tant
Poor thing for the dead homies, we pour 'pagne {*gun cocks*}
Like what you say while it's cocked back to him
Guess what goes around comes around got back to him {*gunshot*}

[Chorus]

[Outro: excerpt from the movie "Menace II Society"]
"Now these motherfuckers smoked your goddamn cousin in FRONT of you, nigga!
Blew his head off in front of your face and you ain't gon' do SHIT?!
You acting like a little bitch right now nigga! Man FUCK that, I ain't lettin' that shit ride!
We gon' go in there and smoke all these motherfuckers, I don't care who the fuck out there!
Goddamnit! Is you down nigga?!"
