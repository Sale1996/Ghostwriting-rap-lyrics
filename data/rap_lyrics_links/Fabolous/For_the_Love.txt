[Intro]
It's for the people that do it! (Would you do it for the love?)
I mean do it for real though (Would you do it for the love?)
Yeah!

[Verse One]
Could've left along time ago, fuck it where I'm a go?!
A brother back in the house, couldn't let Obama go
Do it 'cause you love a nigga, if I told my mama go
Those who just follow green, they the first kind to go
Bein broke ain't a joke I'm too comical 
Seven digits nigga, two commas hoe
Make a first million and don't make it your last
Don't come if you ain't ready don't try to make it too fast
Can't learn shit if you never make it to class (Class)
You can't just recycle what should be placed in the trash (Trash)
I started wantin +Mo' money+, and a Stacey Dash (Dash)
A car that cost a house, and a place to crash
Pull the hammer like a camera you don't wanna face the flash
'Cause you'll lose one of your +Suns+, and there's no replacin Nash
Let the faces you show be the same faces you stash
There's more where that came from, y'all know where I came from (BROOK-LYYYYYYNNNNNNNN!!!!)
It's all about that boy that call me papi
So I'm a keep makin that paper, copy
These squares can never stop me (What) got triangles to play me (What)
Two lines for you fuck boys pause that now play me
Right from where I left off let's get back to that real shit
That sit back let's chill shit, whip packs and I kill shit
I chit chat 'bout trill shit, spit that hot field shit
I give you four bars it be a Kit Kat of some real shit (Nice)
Who fuckin wit me? I mean besides your bitch
I Debo your hoe you niggas should hide your bitch (Word)
Like your chain read grandmama gave him (Uh Huh)
I got a thing for women (Uh Huh) I like 'em misbehavin (I Like that)
You know, like bad, Mic +Bad+
So I'm a check 'em when I see 'em, Nike ad
'Cause in this life things come and go like fast
And I'm not one who favors usin words like had
I'm into havin shit, turnin dreams to average shit
Bringin your trophy to the club Dallas Mavericks shit (NICE!)
I came from first of the month money
To wakin up whenever I want money (NICE!)
I chase paper, I hunt money
Make fifty racks like 3PM and call it lunch money (NICE!!!!!)
Nigga your stunt money is blunt money
Your boo only got a text back once from me
And that was what the fuck you want from me?!
HEH HEH! But I know what the fuck she want from me
YEAH! YEAH! YEAH! YEAH! YEAH! YEAH!

[Chorus]
You ain't gotta front for me, I know
I know what she want from me, I know
I know we all want the money only right you gettin to it
Question I come to you with, is would you do it for the love?
Would you do it for the love?
Would you do it for the looooovvvvvvvvvvvvveeee?
Would you do it for the looooovvvvvvvvvvvvveeee?
Girl would you do it for the love? (Hey!)
Would you do it for the love? (Hey!)
Would you do it for the looooovvvvvvvvvvvvveeee?
Would you do it for the looooovvvvvvvvvvvvveeee?
Would you do it for the love
