We push the hottest V's, peel fast<end_line>
through the city, play Monopoly with real cash<end_line>
Me and Biggie and the models be, shaking they saditty ass<end_line>
And parotta be, somethin you cats got to see<end_line>
And the watches be all types and shapes of stones<end_line>
Bein broke is childish and I'm quite grown<end_line>
Run up in the club with the ice on, me and Paisan'<end_line>
Scope the spot out, see somethin nice and I'm gone<end_line>
You cats is home, screamin the fight's on<end_line>
I'm in the fifteen hundred seats, watchin Ty-son<end_line>
Same night, same fight<end_line>
But one of us cats ain't playin right, I let you tell it<end_line>
People place yourselves in the shoes of two felons<end_line>
And tell me you won't ball every chance you get<end_line>
and any chance you hit, we live for the moment<end_line>
Makes sense don't it?  Now make dollars<end_line>
Cats pop bottles bone chicks that favor Idalis<end_line>
and rack up frequent flier mileage<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I'm poppin Magnums while Jigga bag somethin<end_line>
Watch is platinum, got jet lag from<end_line>
flights back and forth, pop corks of the best grapes<end_line>
Make the best CD's and the best tapes<end_line>
Don't forget the vinyl, take girls break spinals<end_line>
Biggie be Richie like Lionel, shit<end_line>
You seen the Jesus, dipped to H classes<end_line>
Ice project off lights, chick flashes<end_line>
Blind your broke asses, even got rocks in big mustaches<end_line>
Rock top fashions<end_line>
Ain't shit changed, except the number after the dot<end_line>
on the Range, way niggaz look at me now, kinda strange<end_line>
I hate y'all too<end_line>
Rather be in Carribean sands with Rachael<end_line>
It's unreal, out the blue Frank White got sex appeal<end_line>
Bitches used to go, "Ewww!"<end_line>
Still tote steel, tryin to see five mil<end_line>
off the sin-gle, for real<end_line>
You ain't fazin the amazin<end_line>
While your gun's raisin, mine is blazin<end_line>
See you on see me all talkin to sweetness<end_line>
Take it for weakness and leave quick<end_line>
Blocker, Roc-a-, Fella, Bad Boy collabo<end_line>
Two MC's with mad dough, ju' know!<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Miracu-lous, pockets stay full<end_line>
Niggaz skip the bull cause we matadors<end_line>
Snatch the P-89's that we pack in the drawers<end_line>
And we, clappin doors in your Acuras<end_line>
Snap like, cameras on amateurs<end_line>
Make you all dance, hold a hammer to yours<end_line>
Jig and Big rock ice, no cracks or flaws<end_line>
Erybody got a part to play, back to yours<end_line>
Run up in your crib now, crack your doors<end_line>
Watch the real players live, it's a habit to floss<end_line>
Play the charts like the Beatles, y'all adapt you lost<end_line>
And toast Cristal on behalf of y'all<end_line>
Too bad for y'all, ain't too many as bad as yours<end_line>
truly, do we, we laugh at y'all<end_line>
Little bastards y'all<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Uhh, uhh<end_line>
We hit makers with acres<end_line>
Roll shakers in Vegas, you can't break us<end_line>
Lost chips on Lakers, gassed off Shaq<end_line>
Country house, tennis courts on horseback<end_line>
Ridin decidin cracked crab or lobster<end_line>
Who say mobsters don't prosper<end_line>
Niggaz is actors, niggaz deserve Oscars<end_line>
Me I'm, critically acclaimed, slug past your brain<end_line>
Reminesce on dames who, coochie used to stink<end_line>
When we rocked house pieces and puffy Gucci links<end_line>
Now we buy homes in unfamiliar places<end_line>
Tito smile everytime he see our faces<end_line>
Cases catch more than outfield-ers<end_line>
Half these rappin cats, ain't seen war<end_line>
Couldn't score if they had point game, they lame<end_line>
Speak my name, I make em dash like Dame<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I love the dough, more than you know<end_line>
Gotta let it show, I love the dough, hey<end_line>
