Yeah, this album is dedicated to all the teachers that told me <end_line>
I'd never amount to nothin', to all the people that lived above the <end_line>
buildings that I was hustlin' in front of that called the police on <end_line>
me when I was just tryin' to make some money to feed my daughters, <end_line>
and all the niggaz in the struggle, you know what I'm sayin'?<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
It was all a dream <end_line>
I used to read Word Up magazine <end_line>
Salt'n'Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine <end_line>
Hangin' pictures on my wall <end_line>
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl <end_line>
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped<end_line>
Smokin' weed and bamboo, sippin' on private stock <end_line>
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack <end_line>
With the hat to match <end_line>
Remember Rappin' Duke, duh-ha, duh-ha<end_line>
You never thought that hip hop would take it this far <end_line>
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight <end_line>
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade <end_line>
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner <end_line>
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner <end_line>
Peace to Ron G, Brucey B, Kid Capri <end_line>
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starsky <end_line>
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would <end_line>
Call the crib, same number same hood <end_line>
It's all good <end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I made the change from a common thief <end_line>
To up close and personal with Robin Leach <end_line>
And I'm far from cheap, I smoke skunk with my peeps all day <end_line>
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way <end_line>
The Moet and Alize keep me pissy<end_line>
Girls used to diss me <end_line>
Now they write letters 'cause they miss me <end_line>
I never thought it could happen, this rappin' stuff <end_line>
I was too used to packin' gats and stuff <end_line>
Now honies play me close like butter played toast <end_line>
From the Mississippi down to the east coast <end_line>
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks <end_line>
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak <end_line>
Livin' life without fear <end_line>
Puttin' 5 karats in my baby girl's ears <end_line>
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool <end_line>
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school <end_line>
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood <end_line>
And it's still all good <end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis <end_line>
When I was dead broke, man I couldn't picture this <end_line>
50 inch screen, money green leather sofa <end_line>
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur <end_line>
Phone bill about two G's flat <end_line>
No need to worry, my accountant handles that <end_line>
And my whole crew is loungin' <end_line>
Celebratin' every day, no more public housin' <end_line>
Thinkin' back on my one-room shack <end_line>
Now my mom pimps a Ac' with minks on her back <end_line>
And she loves to show me off, of course <end_line>
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source <end_line>
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us <end_line>
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us <end_line>
Birthdays was the worst days <end_line>
Now we sip champagne when we thirst-ay <end_line>
Uh, damn right I like the life I live <end_line>
'Cause I went from negative to positive <end_line>
And it's all... <end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Representin' B-Town in the house, Junior Mafia, mad flavor, uh<end_line>
Uh, yeah, a-ight<end_line>
