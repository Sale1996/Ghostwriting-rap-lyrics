I go, on and on and on and<end_line>
Don't take 'em to the crib unless they bonin<end_line>
Easy, call 'em on the phone and<end_line>
Platinum Chanel cologne and<end_line>
I stay, dressed, to impress<end_line>
Spark these bitches interest<end_line>
Sex is all I expect<end_line>
If they watch TV in the Lex, they know<end_line>
They know, quarter past fo'<end_line>
Left the club tipsy, say no mo'<end_line>
Except how I'm gettin home, tomorrow<end_line>
Caesar drop you off when he see his P.O.<end_line>
Back of my mind I hope she swallow<end_line>
Man she spilled a drink on my cream Wallows<end_line>
Reach the gate, hungry just ate<end_line>
Riffin, she got to be to work by eight<end_line>
This must mean she ain't tryin to wait<end_line>
Conversate, sex on the first date<end_line>
I state, "You know what you do to me"<end_line>
She starts off, "But I don't usually"<end_line>
Then I, whipped it out, rubber no doubt<end_line>
Step out, show me what you all about<end_line>
Fingers in your mouth, open up your blouse<end_line>
Pull your G-string down South<end_line>
Threw that back out, in the parking lot<end_line>
By a Cherokee and a green drop-top<end_line>
And I don't stop, until I squirt<end_line>
Jeans, skirt, butt-naked - it all work<end_line>
