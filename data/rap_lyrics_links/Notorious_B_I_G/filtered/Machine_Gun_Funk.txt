<verse_start>
So you wanna be hardcore <end_line>
With your hat to the back, talkin bout the gats in your raps <end_line>
But I can't feel that hardcore appeal <end_line>
that you're screamin, baby I'm dreamin <end_line>
This ain't Christopher Williams, still some<end_line>
MC's got to feel one, caps I got to peel some <end_line>
To let niggaz know... that if you fuck with Big-and-Heavy <end_line>
I get up in that ass like a wedgie<end_line>
Says who? Says me, the lyrical <end_line>
Niggaz sayin, "Biggie off the street, it's a miracle" <end_line>
Left the drugs alone, took the thugs along with me <end_line>
Just for niggaz actin shifty <end_line>
Sticks and stones break bones, but the gat'll kill you quicker <end_line>
Especially when I'm drunk off the liquor <end_line>
Smokin funk by the boxes, packin glocks is <end_line>
natural to eat you niggaz like chocolates <end_line>
The funk baby <end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
All I want is bitches, big booty bitches <end_line>
Used to sell crack, so I could stack my riches <end_line>
Now I pack gats, to stop all the snitches <end_line>
from stayin in my business, what is this?  Relentless <end_line>
approach, to know if I'm broke or not <end_line>
Just cause I joke and smoke a lot <end_line>
Don't mean I don't tote the glock <end_line>
Sixteen shots for my niggaz in the pen <end_line>
Until we motherfuckin meet again <end_line>
Huh, I'm doin rhymes now, fuck the crimes now <end_line>
Come on the ave, I'm real hard to find now <end_line>
Cause I'm knee deep in the beats <end_line>
In the Land Cruiser Jeep with the Mac-10 by the seats <end_line>
For the jackers, the jealous ass crackers in the<end_line>
I'll make you prove that it's bulletproof <end_line>
Hold ya head, cause when you hit the bricks <end_line>
I got gin, mad blunts, and bitches suckin dick <end_line>
The funk baby <end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
So I guess you know the story, the rap-side, crack-side <end_line>
How I smoked funk, smacked bitches on the backside <end_line>
Bed-Stuy, the place where my head rests <end_line>
Fifty shot clip if a nigga wan' test <end_line>
The rocket launcher, Biggie stomped ya <end_line>
High as a motherfuckin helicopter <end_line>
That's why I pack a nina, fuck a misdeameanor <end_line>
Beatin motherfuckers like Ike beat Tina <end_line>
when I'm rippin all through your whole crew <end_line>
Strapped like bamboo, but I don't sling guns <end_line>
I got bags of funk, and it's sellin by the tons <end_line>
Niggaz wanna know, how I live the mack life <end_line>
Making money smoking mics like crack pipes<end_line>
It's type simple and plain to maintain <end_line>
I add a little funk to the brain <end_line>
The funk baby <end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Repeat chorus <end_line>
<verse_end>
