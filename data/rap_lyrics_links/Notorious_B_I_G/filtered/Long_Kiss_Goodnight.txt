I make yo' mouthpiece obese like Della Reese<end_line>
When I release, you loose teeth like Lil' Cease<end_line>
Nigga please, blood floods yo' Dungarees<end_line>
And that's just the half on my warpath<end_line>
Laugh now cry later, I rhyme greater<end_line>
than the average playa hater, and spectators<end_line>
buy my CD twice; they see me in the streets<end_line>
They be like, "Yo he nice, but that's on the low doe"<end_line>
Be the cats with no dough, tried to play me at my show<end_line>
I pull out fo'-fo's, and go up in they clothes<end_line>
Short-change niggaz, snort-caine niggaz<end_line>
Extortion came quicker, bought the Range nigga<end_line>
Ya still tickle me, I used to be as strong as Ripple be<end_line>
til Lil' Cease crippled me<end_line>
Now I play hard, like my girls nipples be<end_line>
The game sour like like a pickle be, y'all know da rules<end_line>
Move from BK to New Jeruz -- thinkin bout<end_line>

Now the year's new, I lay my game flat<end_line>
I want my spot back, take two<end_line>
Motherfuckers mad cause I blew, niggaz envious<end_line>
Too many niggaz on my dick, shit strenuous<end_line>
When my men bust, you just move wit such stamina<end_line>
Slugs missed ya, I ain't mad at cha<end_line>
Blood rushin, concussions, ain't nothin<end_line>
Catch cases, come out frontin, smokin somethin<end_line>
Sippin White Russians, bitch in the Benz bumpin<end_line>
I laced it wit the basic, six TV's a system<end_line>
Knockin Mase shit, face it, we hard to hit<end_line>
Guard ya shit, 'fore I stick you, for your re-up<end_line>
Wipe the pee up, mixed shots, woke your seed up<end_line>
Go in the ashtray, spark the weed up, LONG KISS<end_line>

Try to rush me, slugs go, touchy-touchy<end_line>
You're bleedin lovely, wit'chyo, spirit above me<end_line>
or beneath me, your whole life you live sneaky<end_line>
Now you rest eternally, sleepy, you burn when you creep me<end_line>
Rest where the worms and the weak be<end_line>
My nine flies, baptize, rap guys<end_line>
With the Holy Ghost, I put holes in most<end_line>
You hold your toast shaky, slippin tryin to break me<end_line>
Look what you made me do, brains blew<end_line>
My team in the marine-blue, six Coupe<end_line>
Skied it out, weeded out, cleanin out -- the block<end_line>
for distances, givin long kisses BITCH<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
All we have to do now.. is say a prayer for you.. y'know?<end_line>
That's all we have to do, just to pray for your mind.. cause..<end_line>
Eheh, see your mind got control of your heart..<end_line>

Distribute to, kids who, take heart like Valentine<end_line>
Drink Ballentine, all the time<end_line>
Slugs hit your chest tap you spine, flatline<end_line>
Heard through the grapevine, you got fucked fo' times<end_line>

I can't hate you.. cause it's not in my nature to hate you..<end_line>
You know, I don't know..<end_line>
Maybe.. I'm a different type of individual..<end_line>
But.. you have me on the line..<end_line>
