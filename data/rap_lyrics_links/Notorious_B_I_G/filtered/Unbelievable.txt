Live from Bedford-Stuyvesant, the livest one<end_line>
Representin BK to the fullest<end_line>
Gats I pull it, bastards duckin when Big be buckin<end_line>
Chickenheads be cluckin in my bathroom fuckin<end_line>
It ain't nuttin, they know Big be handlin<end_line>
with the mac in the Ac' door paneling<end_line>
Bandaging MC's, oxygen they can't breathe<end_line>
Mad tricks up the sleeve, wear boxers so my dick can breathe<end_line>
Breeze through in the Q-45 by my side, lyrical high<end_line>
And those that rushes my cluthes get put on crutches<end_line>
Get smoked like dutches from the master<end_line>
Hate to blast ya, but I have ta, you see I smoke a lot<end_line>
Your life is played out like Kwame, and them fuckin polka dots<end_line>
Who rock the spot?  Biggie!<end_line>
You know how the weed go, unbelievable<end_line>

<verse_start>
B-I-G, G-I-E, AKA, B.I.G.<end_line>
Get it? Biggie<end_line>
Also known as the bon appetit<end_line>
Rappers can't sleep need sleepin Big keep creepin<end_line>
Bulelts heat-seekin, casualties need treatin<end_line>
Dumb rappers need teachin<end_line>
Lesson A - don't fuck with B-I, that's that<end_line>
Oh I, thought he was wack; oh come come now<end_line>
Why y'all so dumb now - hunt me or be hunted<end_line>
I got three hundred and fifty-seven ways<end_line>
to simmer sautee, I'm the winner all day<end_line>
Lights get dimmer down Biggie's hallway<end_line>
My forte causes caucausians to say<end_line>
He sounds demented, car weed scented<end_line>
If I said it, I meant it<end_line>
Bite my tongue for no-one<end_line>
Call me evil, or unbelievable<end_line>

<verse_start>
Buck shots out the sun roof of Lexus Coupes<end_line>
Leave no witnesses, what you think this is<end_line>
Ain't no amateurs here, I damage and tear<end_line>
MC's fear me, they too near not to hear me<end_line>
Clearly, I'm the triple beam dream<end_line>
One thousand grams of uncut to the gut<end_line>
It seems fucked up, the way I touched up the grill<end_line>
Tryin to play gorilla, when you ain't no killer<end_line>
The gat's by your liver, your upper lip quiver<end_line>
Get ready to die, tell God I said hi<end_line>
And throw down some ice, for the nicest MC<end_line>
Niggaz know the steelo, unbelievable<end_line>
