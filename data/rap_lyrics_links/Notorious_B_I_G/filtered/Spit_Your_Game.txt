<verse_start>
Armed and dangerous, ain't too many can bang with us<end_line>
Straight up weed no angel dust, label us Notorious<end_line>
Thug ass niggaz that love to bust, it's strange to us<end_line>
Y'all niggaz be scramblin, gamblin<end_line>
Up in restaurants with mandolins, and violins<end_line>
We just sittin here tryin to win, tryin not to sin<end_line>
High off weed and lots of gin<end_line>
So much smoke need oxygen, steadily countin them Benjamins<end_line>
Nigga you should too, if you knew What this game'll do to you<end_line>
Been in this shit since ninety-two<end_line>
Look at all the bullshit I been through<end_line>
So-called beef with you know who<end_line>
Fuck a few female stars or two<end_line>
Nigga, blue light, nigga, move like Mike, shit<end_line>

Me and my dogs love to buck shit<end_line>
Fuck the luck shit, strictly aim<end_line>
No aspirations to quit the game<end_line>
Spit yo' game, talk yo' shit<end_line>
Grab yo' gat, call yo' click<end_line>
Squeeze yo' clip, hit the right one<end_line>
Pass that weed, I got to light one<end_line>
All them niggaz I got ta fight one<end_line>
All them hoes I got ta like one<end_line>
Our situation is a tight one<end_line>
Whatcha gonna do, fight or run?<end_line>
