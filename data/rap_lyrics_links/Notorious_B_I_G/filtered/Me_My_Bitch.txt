When I met you I admit my first thoughts was to trick<end_line>
You look so good huh, I suck on your daddy's dick<end_line>
I never felt that way in my life<end_line>
It didn't take long before I made you my wife<end_line>
Got no rings and shit, just my main squeeze<end_line>
Come into the crib, even had a set a keys<end_line>
During the days you helped me bag up my nickels<end_line>
In the process, I admit, I tricked a little<end_line>
But you was my bitch, the one who'd never snitch<end_line>
Love me when I'm broke or when I'm filthy fuckin rich<end_line>
And I admit, when the time is right, the wine is right<end_line>
I treat you right, you talk slick, I beat you right<end_line>

Moonlight strolls with the hoes, oh no, that's not my steelo<end_line>
I wanna bitch that like to play celo, and craps<end_line>
Packin gats, in a Coach bag steamin dime bags<end_line>
A real bitch is all I want, all I ever had<end_line>
With a glock just as strong as me<end_line>
Totin guns just as long as me, the bitch belongs with me<end_line>
Any plans with another bitch, my bitch'll spoil it<end_line>
One day, she used my toothbrush to clean the toilet<end_line>
Throwin my clothes out the windows, so when the wind blows<end_line>
I see my Polos and Timbos<end_line>
Hide my car keys so I can't leave<end_line>
A real slick bitch, keep a trick up her sleeve<end_line>
And if I deceive, she won't take it lightly<end_line>
She'll invite me, politely, to fight G<end_line>
And then we lie together, cry together<end_line>
I swear to God I hope we fuckin die together<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
She helped me plan out my robberies on my enemies<end_line>
Didn't hesitate to squeeze, to get my life out of danger<end_line>
One day, she put nine one one on the page<end_line>
Had to call back, whether it's minor or major<end_line>
No response, the phone just rung<end_line>
Grab my vest, grab my gun, to find out the problem<end_line>
When I pulled up, police was on the scene<end_line>
Had to make the U-turn, make sure my shit was clean<end_line>
Drove down the block, stashed the burner in the bushes<end_line>
Stepped to police with the shoves and the pushes<end_line>
It didn't take long before the tears start<end_line>
I saw my bitch dead with the gunshot to the heart<end_line>
And I know it was meant for me<end_line>
I guess the niggaz felt they had to kill the closest one to me<end_line>
And when I find em your life is to and end<end_line>
They killed my best friend... me and my bitch<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Uh, yeah, yeah<end_line>
Uh, motherfucker yeah<end_line>
