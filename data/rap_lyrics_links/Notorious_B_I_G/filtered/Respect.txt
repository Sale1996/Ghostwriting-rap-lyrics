Nineteen-seventy somethin', nigga I don't sweat the date<end_line>
My moms is late so I had to plan my escape<end_line>
out the skins, in this world of fly girls<end_line>
Tanqueray and Hennessy until I cold hurl<end_line>
Ten months in this gut, what the fuck<end_line>
I wish moms'd hurry up so I could get buck<end_line>
wild, juvenile rippin' mics and shit<end_line>
New York New York, ready for the likes of this, uh<end_line>
Then came the worst date, May 21st<end_line>
2:19, that's when my momma water burst<end_line>
No spouse in the house so she rode for self<end_line>
to the hospital, to see if she could get a little help<end_line>
Umbilical cord's wrapped around my neck<end_line>
I'm seein' my death and I ain't even took my first step<end_line>
I made it out, I'm bringin' mad joy<end_line>
The doctor looked and said, "He's gonna be a Bad Boy"<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Now I'm thirteen, smokin' blunts, makin' cream<end_line>
On the drug scene, fuck a football team<end_line>
Riskin' ruptured spleens by the age of sixteen<end_line>
Hearin' the coach scream at my lifetime dream, I mean<end_line>
I wanna blow up, stack my dough up<end_line>
So school I didn't show up, it fucked my flow up<end_line>
Mom said that I should grow up and check myself<end_line>
before I wreck myself, disrespect myself<end_line>
Put the drugs on the shelf?  Nah, couldn't see it<end_line>
Scarface, King of New York, I wanna be it<end_line>
Rap was secondary, money was necessary<end_line>
Until I got incarcerated--kinda scary<end_line>
C74-Mark 8 set me straight<end_line>
Not able to move behind the great steel gate<end_line>
Time to contemplate, damn, where did I fail?<end_line>
All the money I stacked was all the money for bail<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Ninety-four, now I explore new horizons<end_line>
Mama smile when she see me, that's surprisin'<end_line>
Honeys is tantalizin', they freak all night<end_line>
Peep duckin' cops on the creep all night<end_line>
As I open my eyes and realizin' I changed<end_line>
Not the same deranged child stuck up in the game<end_line>
And to my niggas livin' street life<end_line>
Learn to treat life to the best, put stress to rest<end_line>
Still tote your vest man, niggas be trippin'<end_line>
In the streets without a gat?  Nah, nigga you're slippin'<end_line>
If I'm pimpin on The F with weed on my breath<end_line>
Original hustler with the muffler on the Tec<end_line>
Respect to the Mac's and the Ac's<end_line>
To the freaks in the Jeeps, lick shots to my peeps<end_line>
<verse_end>
