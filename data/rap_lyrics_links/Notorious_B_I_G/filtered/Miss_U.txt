We miss you nigga<end_line>
Goin out to all the niggas that died in the struggle<end_line>

Word up<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Each and every day<end_line>
The daydreams of how we used to be<end_line>
See your family<end_line>
And that baby's lookin just like you<end_line>
Why'd you go away<end_line>
I've been missin you lately<end_line>
Tell me what you're goin through, oh yeah<end_line>

<verse_start>
I remember sellin three bricks of straight flour<end_line>
Got my man a beat down to the third power<end_line>
He didn't care, spent the money in a half hour<end_line>
Got some fishscale, rained on competition like a shower<end_line>
Got the coke cooked up, a crackhead Kevin<end_line>
In eighty-eight, when Kane ruled, with Half Steppin<end_line>
A thirty-eight, a lot of mouth, was our only weapon<end_line>
We was king till the G's crept in<end_line>
And now I'm missin em<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
We work all week, weekends we play the movies<end_line>
We rock flatops, our girls rocked doobies<end_line>
Made a killin, even though the D's knew me<end_line>
Eventually, you know they try to do me, fuck it<end_line>
Fed up, my nigga wanted to take it down South<end_line>
Sick of cops comin, sick of throwin jacks in his mouth<end_line>
Gave him half my paper, told 'em go that route<end_line>
Few months, he got his brain blown out<end_line>
Now I'm stressed<end_line>
His baby's mother, she trippin, blamin me<end_line>
And his older brothers, understand, the game it be<end_line>
Kinda topsy turvy; you win some, you lose some<end_line>
Damn, they lost a brother - they mother lost a son<end_line>
Fuck, why my nigga couldn't stay in NY?<end_line>
I'm a thug, but I swear for three days I cried<end_line>
I look in the sky and ask God why<end_line>
Can't look his baby girls in the eye<end_line>
Damn I miss you<end_line>

There was this girl around the way that make cats drool<end_line>
Her name's Drew, played fools out they money in pool<end_line>
People swore we was fuckin but we was just cool<end_line>
She used to hang while I slang my drugs after school<end_line>
She'd watch my bomb, help my moms with the groceries<end_line>
My little sister, the girl was kinda close to me<end_line>
A little closer than the average girl's supposed to be<end_line>
Far from a lover, my girl was jealous of her<end_line>
Then she started messin with some major players<end_line>
Handled keys, niggas called them the Bricklayers<end_line>
A dread kid, had a baby fore that bitch Taya<end_line>
Found out her baby's father cheatin, now Drew she gotta slay her<end_line>
One night, across from the corner store<end_line>
Taya ran around the block with a chrome four-four<end_line>
Squeezed all six shots in the passenger door<end_line>
The dude lived, what my baby had to die for<end_line>
We missin her<end_line>
