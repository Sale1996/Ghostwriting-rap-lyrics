Back up chump, you know Biggie Smalls rips it quick<end_line>
and kicks it quick, you know how black niggaz get<end_line>
with the hoods fatigues with the boots with trees<end_line>
Smokin weed, flippin ki's, makin crazy G's<end_line>
Hittin buckshots at niggaz that open spots<end_line>
on the avenue, take my loot, and I'm baggin you<end_line>
Pimpin hoes that drive Volvo's and Rodeos<end_line>
Flash the roll, make her wet, in her pantyhose<end_line>
Damn, a nigga style is unorthodox<end_line>
Grip the glock, when I walk down the crowded blocks<end_line>
Just in case a nigga wanna act out<end_line>
I just black out, and blow they motherfuckin back out<end_line>
That's a real nigga for ya<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
When we smoke spliffs, we pack four-fifths<end_line>
just in case dread wanna riff<end_line>
He get a free lift to the cemetary, rough very<end_line>
Not your ordinary, we watch you get buried<end_line>
That's a real nigga for ya<end_line>
Get mad do a quarter flip the script, and rip your lawyer<end_line>
Spit at the D.A., cause fuck what she say<end_line>
She don't give a fuck about your ass anyway<end_line>
Up North found first stop for the town<end_line>
of Fishkill, where the hand skills are real ill<end_line>
You'll be a super Hoover doo-doo stain remover<end_line>
Ha hahhh, yo G, pass the buddha<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Money hoes and clothes<end_line>
Blunt smoke comin out the nose, is all a nigga knows<end_line>
Flippin on foes, puttin tags on toes<end_line>
Watchin the stash grow, clockin the cashflow<end_line>
The neighborhood gravedigga<end_line>
Gettin paid so much, all the bitches wanna see a nigga<end_line>
I guess they figure I'm paid, I wanna get laid<end_line>
or since I got loot I wanna knock boots<end_line>
I'd rather beat my dick than trick<end_line>
and if she don't suck then we don't fuck<end_line>
I'd rather make a buck, drive a fat-ass truck<end_line>
Grab the 9, two clips, and run amuck<end_line>
Yes, flex at the two or three Benzes<end_line>
I wreck shit, what the fuck you expected?<end_line>
A fly guy?  Well fuck it, I'm the high guy<end_line>
from Bed-Stuy, puttin the swellin on your eye<end_line>
and your nose even, when I choke ya you stop breathin<end_line>
And when Jake come, I'm leavin!<end_line>
<verse_end>

Chorus 4X<end_line>
