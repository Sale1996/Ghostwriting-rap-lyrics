<verse_start>
To all the ladies in the place with style and grace<end_line>
Allow me to lace these lyrical douches, in your bushes<end_line>
Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mommies<end_line>
The back of the club, sippin Moet, is where you'll find me<end_line>
The back of the club, mackin hoes, my crew's behind me<end_line>
Mad question askin, blunt passin, music blastin<end_line>
But I just can't quit<end_line>
Cause one of these honies Biggie gots ta creep with<end_line>
Sleep with, keep the ep a secret why not<end_line>
Why blow up my spot cause we both got hot<end_line>
Now check it, I got more Mack than Craig and in the bed<end_line>
Believe me sweety I got enough to feed the needy<end_line>
No need to be greedy I got mad friends with Benz's<end_line>
C-notes by the layers, true fuckin players<end_line>
Jump in the Rover and come over<end_line>

Straight up honey really I'm askin<end_line>
Most of these niggaz think they be mackin but they be actin<end_line>
Who they attractin with that line, "What's your name what's your sign?"<end_line>
Soon as he buy that wine I just creep up from behind<end_line>
And ask what your interests are, who you be with<end_line>
Things to make you smile, what numbers to dial<end_line>
You gon' be here for a while, I'm gon' go call my crew<end_line>
You go call your crew<end_line>
We can rendezvous at the bar around two<end_line>
Plans to leave, throw the keys to Lil Cease<end_line>
Pull the truck up, front, and roll up the next blunt<end_line>
So we can steam on the way to the telly go fill my belly<end_line>
A t-bone steak, cheese eggs and Welch's grape<end_line>
Conversate for a few, cause in a few, we gon' do<end_line>
What we came to do, ain't that right boo<end_line>
Forget the telly we just go to the crib<end_line>
and watch a movie in the jacuzzi smoke l's while you do me<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
In mansion and Benz's<end_line>
Givin ends to my friends and it feels stupendous<end_line>
Tremendous cream, fuck a dollar and a dream<end_line>
Still tote gats strapped with infrared beams<end_line>
Choppin o's, smokin lye an' Optimo's<end_line>
Money hoes and clothes all a nigga knows<end_line>
A foolish pleasure, whatever<end_line>
I had to find the buried treasure, so grams I had to measure<end_line>
However living better now, Coogi sweater now<end_line>
