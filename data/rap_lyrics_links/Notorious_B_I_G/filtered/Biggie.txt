For the love of BIG, we bang out<end_line>
Since my man died, we don't hang out<end_line>
We blow brains out, we tear the club up pullin things out<end_line>
Mafia World, all my niggaz max out<end_line>
We Bad Boys, why ya'll niggaz cracked out<end_line>
Coward niggaz, most are burried down south<end_line>
Far from gangstas, really hush puppies<end_line>
Niggaz bearly speak when we discuss money<end_line>
Niggaz stay yappin when there's always somethin funny<end_line>
The realest niggaz never took nuthin from me<end_line>
Rock ice, stay jig, fuck with niggaz that got drunk, and hate kids<end_line>
Got niggaz on state bids, that hate movies like Rosewood and Matrix<end_line>
A yo, Biggie taught me well, Biggie told me how to flip bricks like cartwheel<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Representin Bucktown<end_line>
Mack 11's cocked back, niggaz better duck down<end_line>
Face down, you know the routine, the cream<end_line>
Earings, you know the drama Biggie bring<end_line>

For BIG I learn to grip aim and cock it<end_line>
Once I got it, I lock it<end_line>
Banger, big city boy with deep pockets<end_line>
See me speak, that paper better be the topic<end_line>
I like my ice frozen like the Antartic<end_line>
I'm quick to finish it, your good to start it<end_line>
And with the flashy colors on, you just a target, Waitin for a hard hit<end_line>
I like marine blue, marine green, roll with a mean team<end_line>
Meshed out, fresh out, and stay greams<end_line>
We big boys, we do big things, born in this county of kings<end_line>
I ain't got shit, I spread things, take things<end_line>
Fuck whenever my mood swings, from the summer for the winter to the spring<end_line>
My nigga ill's holdin it down for the beam<end_line>
Like BIG said, we do the real things, we still bubble and steal chains<end_line>
Still tustle, still struggle, we feel pain<end_line>
Still ride, still die for BIG's name<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
For BIG I grip the cig, put six in your wig<end_line>
Not cause of what he said, cause of what he did<end_line>
When I hear that pop quiz, that's the way I was raised and thats the way it is for..<end_line>
We roll like the Panthers, show our guns on camera<end_line>
Do jokes with police scanners, niggaz mediocre, full of dirt like hampers<end_line>
I roll with a bunch of niggaz that wear bandanas and rep...<end_line>
We kept it thurough, from the heart ripped the barrel<end_line>
B.K. style, see BIG howl, now<end_line>
Lets see who, wanna go against Mafia world<end_line>
Niggaz nuthin but squirels, they know we rep...<end_line>
Niggaz tryin to get a nut, hit in the head or below the gut<end_line>
Wood style roll'em up, get plucked, nigga what<end_line>
Go back to spend a ton, and know cats wit gold tooths<end_line>
Know my gat and bust for my nigga...<end_line>
<verse_end>
