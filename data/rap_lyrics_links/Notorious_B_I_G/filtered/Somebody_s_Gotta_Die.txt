<verse_start>
I'm sittin in the crib dreamin about Leer jets and coupes<end_line>
The way Salt shoops and how they sell records like Snoop<end_line>
I'm interrupted by a doorbell<end_line>
3:52, who the hell<end_line>
Is this?<end_line>
I gets up quick<end_line>
Cocks my shit<end_line>
Stop the dogs from barkin<end_line>
Then proceed to walkin<end_line>
Its a face that I seen before<end_line>
My nigga Sing, we used to sling on the 16th floor<end_line>
Check it<end_line>
I look deeper<end_line>
I see blood up on his sneakers<end_line>
And his fist gripped a chrome four-fifth<end_line>
So I dip<end_line>
Nigga, is you creepin or speakin?<end_line>
He tells me C-Rock just got hit up at the beacon<end_line>
I opens up the door, pitiful<end_line>
Is he in critical?<end_line>
Retaliation for this one won't be minimal<end_line>
Cuz I'm a criminal<end_line>
Way before the rap shit<end_line>
Bust the gat shit<end_line>
Puff won't even know what happened,<end_line>
If it's done smoothly<end_line>
Silencers on the Uzi<end_line>
Stash in the hooptie<end_line>
My alibi, any cutie<end_line>
With a booty that done fuck Big Pop<end_line>
Head spinnin, reminiscin bout my man C-Rock<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Fillin clips he explained our situation<end_line>
Precisely, so we know exactly what we facin<end_line>
Some kid named Jason<end_line>
In a Honda station wagon<end_line>
Was braggin<end_line>
About how much loot and crack he stackin<end_line>
Rock had a grip so they formed up a clique<end_line>
Small crew<end_line>
'Round the time I was locked up with you<end_line>
True indeed<end_line>
But yo nigga let me proceed<end_line>
Don't fill them clips too high<end_line>
Give them bullets room to breathe<end_line>
Damn where was I?<end_line>
One night in town<end_line>
Blew the fuck up<end_line>
D-Rock went home<end_line>
And Jay got stuck the fuck up<end_line>
Hit 'em twice<end_line>
Got 'em right for the virgin white<end_line>
Pistol whipped his kids<end_line>
And taped up his wife<end_line>
He said "Yo Rock, set em up", no question<end_line>
Wet em up no less <end_line>
Than 50 shots in his direction<end_line>
How many shots?<end_line>
Man nigga, I seen mad holes<end_line>
What kinda gats?<end_line>
Hitch links, Cocks, and Calicoles<end_line>
But fuck that<end_line>
I know where all them niggas rest at<end_line>
In the buildin hustlin<end_line>
And they don't be strapped<end_line>
Supreme in black<end_line>
Is downstairs, the engine runnin<end_line>
Find a bag to put the guns in<end_line>
And c'mon if yo comin<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Exchanged hugs and pounds before the throw down<end_line>
How its gonna go down<end_line>
Lay these niggas low-down<end_line>
Slow down<end_line>
Fuck all that plannin shit<end_line>
Run up in they cribs<end_line>
And make em catch the man n shit<end_line>
See niggas like you do ten year bids<end_line>
Miss the niggas they want<end_line>
And murder innocent kids<end_line>
Not I<end_line>
One niggas in my eye<end_line>
That's Jason<end_line>
Ain't no slugs gonna be wasted<end_line>
Revenge I'm tastin at the tip of my lips<end_line>
I can't wait to feel my clip in his hips<end_line>
Pass the chocolate<end_line>
Sing ain't lie<end_line>
There's Jason with his back to me<end_line>
Talkin to his faculty<end_line>
I start to get a funny feelins<end_line>
Put the mask on in case his niggas start squealin<end_line>
Scream his name out<end_line>
Squeeze six knuckles shorter<end_line>
Nigga turned around holdin his daughter<end_line>
