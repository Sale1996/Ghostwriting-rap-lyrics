<verse_start>
The country bud got me choking<end_line>
I'm on a mission to the point that motherfuckers think I'm smoking<end_line>
Yeah that sick nigga Biggie with the 8 shot fifth<end_line>
With the extra clip for that extra shit<end_line>
Don't you know that a killing is thrilling?<end_line>
All the blood spilling, is all up on the drug dealing<end_line>
A born gangsta my daddy was a thug<end_line>
Had a .38 with the hallow point slug<end_line>
So when he lit shots<end_line>
Niggas dropped, quicker than bootlegger sells his liquor<end_line>
A little nigga tried to squeeze .22's in my Reebok shoes<end_line>
Paying dudes, while kids was on their one's and two's<end_line>
Now I'm much older, colder, fuck a holster<end_line>
Got the MAC-11 swinging from my shoulder<end_line>
It's a damn shame I got to put my mom through the strain<end_line>
I'm living in The House of Pain<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Wendy Williams say "I stay dust" then maybe I should<end_line>
'Cause these rappers will have your phone tapped like Savion Glove<end_line>
And on the West yo police corrupt, some are bloods<end_line>
But these Teflon I loaded explode in some mugs<end_line>
I'm like Furious in 'Boyz 'N The Hood'<end_line>
But at the drive-thru I ain't running I'm dumping<end_line>
Crazy like a Piru and loc'd up, know how Nas do<end_line>
I'm calling Henchmen and Conception<end_line>
To organize a Black Truce<end_line>
And we party hard party with Nas<end_line>
Since they ain't no more - Mardi gras<end_line>
And Bush won't apologize<end_line>
I got gangsta hoes Kobe Bryant scared to sodomize<end_line>
And .45's for them suckers y'all idolize<end_line>
Y'all yelling my name, but y'all soon dying<end_line>
Who be trying to portray real but they be lying<end_line>
'Cause they want the real niggas to die so they can gain<end_line>
But neva that, this ain't neva last, this The House of Pain<end_line>
<verse_end>
