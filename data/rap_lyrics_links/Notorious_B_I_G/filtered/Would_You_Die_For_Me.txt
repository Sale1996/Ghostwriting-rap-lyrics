<verse_start>
Venue after venue, I've been through<end_line>
Coming to the telly, so I can bend you<end_line>
Send you to the store, condoms and more<end_line>
Jealous females, call you sluts and whores<end_line>
Could it be my hardcore metaphor<end_line>
Make sweat pour on the bedroom floor<end_line>
Open up the Lex door<end_line>
Jump on in, I'm kind of tired<end_line>
I'm a roll blunts while you spin<end_line>
You got your license, right? Alright, no swerving<end_line>
Hair blonde out, Madonna style like a virgin<end_line>
Splurging, Dom P., Ro-se<end_line>
Much foreplay, that's my forte<end_line>
Niggas see the ring, baguettes to death<end_line>
She looking for a man, honey he just left<end_line>
Violate me, he get beat to death<end_line>
Goodfellas squeeze every shell they got left<end_line>
Grand Marnier increase the don strength<end_line>
Two four-fifths within my arms length<end_line>
With a calm breath I say we gots to float<end_line>
Throw Little Cease the keys to the boat<end_line>
Tongue all down her throat, you know the routine<end_line>
Got my dick large like Bruce Springsteen<end_line>
And you mean too, eyes greenish blue<end_line>
Got the Coogi sweater with the bubble Fubu<end_line>
Beautiful, that's how the night goes<end_line>
Get out them tight clothes<end_line>
Get in some night clothes<end_line>
I invite those girls that smoke lye<end_line>
Keep it real with you<end_line>
You keep it real with I<end_line>
We be tight like frog's ass<end_line>
Have you screaming "Biggie, Biggie give me one more chance"<end_line>
