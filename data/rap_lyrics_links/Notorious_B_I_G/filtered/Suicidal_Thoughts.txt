<verse_start>
When I die, fuck it I wanna go to hell<end_line>
Cause I'm a piece of shit, it ain't hard to fuckin' tell<end_line>
It don't make sense, goin' to heaven wit the goodie-goodies<end_line>
Dressed in white, I like black Tims and black hoodies<end_line>
God will probably have me on some real strict shit<end_line>
No sleepin' all day, no gettin my dick licked<end_line>
Hangin' with the goodie-goodies loungin' in paradise<end_line>
Fuck that shit, I wanna tote guns and shoot dice<end_line>
All my life I been considered as the worst<end_line>
Lyin' to my mother, even stealin' out her purse<end_line>
Crime after crime, from drugs to extortion<end_line>
I know my mother wished she got a fuckin' abortion<end_line>
She don't even love me like she did when I was younger<end_line>
Suckin' on her chest just to stop my fuckin' hunger<end_line>
I wonder if I died, would tears come to her eyes?<end_line>
Forgive me for my disrespect, forgive me for my lies<end_line>
My babies' mothers 8 months, her little sister's 2<end_line>
Who's to blame for both of them<end_line>
I swear to God I just want to slit my wrists and end this bullshit<end_line>
Throw the Magnum to my head, threaten to pull shit<end_line>
And squeeze, until the bed's, completely red<end_line>
I'm glad I'm dead, a worthless fuckin' buddah head<end_line>
The stress is buildin' up, I can't,<end_line>
I can't believe suicide's on my fuckin' mind<end_line>
I want to leave, I swear to God I feel like death is fuckin' callin' me<end_line>
Naw you wouldn't understand<end_line>
You see its kinda like the crack did to Pookie, in New Jack<end_line>
Except when I cross over, there ain't no comin' back<end_line>
Should I die on the train track, like Remo in Beatstreet<end_line>
People at the funeral frontin' like they miss me<end_line>
My baby momma kissed me but she glad I'm gone<end_line>
She knew me and her sista had somethin' goin' on<end_line>
I reach my peak, I can't speak,<end_line>
call my nigga Chic, tell him that my will is weak.<end_line>
I'm sick of niggas lyin', I'm sick of bitches hawkin',<end_line>
matter of fact, I'm sick of talkin'.<end_line>
