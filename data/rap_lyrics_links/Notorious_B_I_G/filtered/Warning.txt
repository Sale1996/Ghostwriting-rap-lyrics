of niggaz wanna stick me like flypaper neighbor<end_line>
Slow down love, please chill, drop the caper<end_line>

Nah they're my niggaz nah love wouldn't disrespect<end_line>
  I didn't say them, they schooled me to some niggaz<end_line>

  They heard about the Rolex's and the Lexus<end_line>

  They heard about the pounds you got down in Georgetown<end_line>
  And they heard you got half of Virginia locked down<end_line>
  They even heard about the crib you bought your moms out in Florida <end_line>
  The fifth corridor --<end_line>
-- call the coroner!<end_line>
There's gonna be a lot of slow singin, and flower bringin<end_line>
if my burgular alarm starts ringin<end_line>
Whatcha think all the guns is for?<end_line>
All purpose war, got the Rottweilers by the door<end_line>
And I feed 'em gunpowder, so they can devour<end_line>
the criminals, tryin to drop my decimals<end_line>
Damn! Niggaz wanna stick my for my cream<end_line>
And it ain't a dream, things ain't always what it seem<end_line>
It's the ones that smoke blunts witcha, see your picture<end_line>
Now they wanna grab the guns and come and getcha<end_line>
Betcha Biggie won't slip<end_line>
I got the calico with the black talons loaded in the clip<end_line>
So I can rip through the ligaments<end_line>
Put the fuckers in a bad prediciment, where all the foul niggaz went<end_line>
Touch my cheddar, feel my Beretta<end_line>
Fuck what I'ma hit you with you motherfuckers betta duck<end_line>
I bring pain, bloodstains on what remains<end_line>

Cocked it, extra clips in my pocket<end_line>
So I can reload and EXPLODE on ya rasshole<end_line>
I fuck around and get hardcore<end_line>
C-4 to ya door no beef no more nigga<end_line>
Feel the rough, scandalous<end_line>
The more weed smoke I puff, the more dangerous<end_line>
I don't give a fuck about you or your weak crew<end_line>
