<verse_start>
1970 somethin'<end_line>
Nigga I don't sweat the date, my moms is late<end_line>
So I had to plan my escape, out the skins<end_line>
In this world, the fly girl<end_line>
Tangere or Hennessy until I called Earl<end_line>
Ten months in this gut, what the fuck<end_line>
I wish moms would hurry up so I could get buck<end_line>
While, Juvenile rippin' mics and shit<end_line>
New York, New York ready for the lights of this<end_line>
Uh, then came the worst date, May, 21st<end_line>
2:19 is when my mama's water burst<end_line>
No spouse in the house, so she rolls herself<end_line>
To the hospital, to see if she could get a little help<end_line>
Umbilical chord's wraped around my neck<end_line>
I'm seein' my death, and I ain't even took my first step<end_line>
I made it out, I'm bringin' mad joy<end_line>
The doctor looked and said "He's gonna be a Bad Boy."<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Now I'm thirteen, smokin' blunts makin' cream<end_line>
On the drug scene, fuck the football team<end_line>
Risk it, rupt' your spleens by the age of sixteen<end_line>
Hearin' the coach scream, made my lifetime dream<end_line>
I mean, I wanna blow up, stack my dough up<end_line>
So school, I didn't show up, it fucked my flow up<end_line>
Ma' said that I should grow up, and check myself<end_line>
Before I wreck myself, disrespect myself<end_line>
Put the drugs on the shelf, nah, couldn't see it<end_line>
Scarface, king of New York, I wanna be it<end_line>
Rap was secondary, money was necessary<end_line>
Until I got incarcerated, kinda scary<end_line>
Seat 74, Mart 8 set me straight<end_line>
Not able to move, behind a great steel gate<end_line>
Time to contemplate, damn, where did I fail?<end_line>
All the money I stacked, was all the money for bail<end_line>
<verse_end>
