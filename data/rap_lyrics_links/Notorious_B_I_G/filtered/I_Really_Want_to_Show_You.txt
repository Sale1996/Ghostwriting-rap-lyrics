<verse_start>
I know how it feel to wake up fucked up<end_line>
Pockets broke as hell, another rock to sell<end_line>
People look at you like youse the user<end_line>
Selling drugs to all the losers, mad buddha abuser<end_line>
But they don't know about your stress-filled day<end_line>
Baby on the way mad bills to pay<end_line>
That's why you drink Tanqueray; so you can reminisce<end_line>
and wish, you wasn't livin so devilish, ssshit<end_line>
I remember I was just like you<end_line>
Smokin blunts with my crew, flippin over 62's<end_line>
Cause G-E-D, wasn't B-I-G<end_line>
I had to get P-A-D, that's why my moms hate me<end_line>
She was forced to kick me out, no doubt<end_line>
Then I figured out licks went for twenty down South<end_line>
Packed up my tools for my raw power move<end_line>
Glock nineteen for casket and flower moves<end_line>
for chumps tryin to stop my flow<end_line>
And what they don't know will show on the autopsy<end_line>
Went to see Papi, to cop me a brick<end_line>
Asked for some consignment, he wasn't tryin to hear it<end_line>
Smoking mad Newports cause I'm due in court<end_line>
for an assault, that I caught, in Bridgeport, New York<end_line>
Catch me if you can like the Gingerbread Man<end_line>
You better have your gat in hand, cause man<end_line>

<verse_start>
I had the master plan<end_line>
I'm in the caravan on my way to Maryland<end_line>
with my man Two-Tecs to take over this projects<end_line>
They call him Two-Tecs, he tote two tecs<end_line>
And when he start to bust he like to ask, "Who's next?"<end_line>
I got my honey on the Amtrak<end_line>
with the crack in the crack of her ass<end_line>
Two pounds of hash in the stash<end_line>
I wait for hon to make some quick cash<end_line>
I told her she could be Lieutenant, bitch got gassed<end_line>
At last, I'm literally loungin black<end_line>
Sittin back, countin double digit thousand stacks<end_line>
Had to re-up; see what's up with my peeps<end_line>
Toyota Deal-a-Thon had it cheap on the Jeeps<end_line>
See who got smoked, what rumors was spread<end_line>
Last I heard I was dead with six to the head<end_line>
Then I got the phone call, it couldn't hit me harder<end_line>
We got infiltrated, like Nino at the Carter<end_line>
Heard Tec got murdered in a town I never heard of<end_line>
by some bitch named Alberta over nickel-plated burners<end_line>
And my bitch swear to God she won't snitch<end_line>
I told her when she hit the bricks I'll make the hooker rich<end_line>
Conspiracy, she'll be home in three<end_line>
Until then I looks out for the whole family<end_line>
A true G, that's me, blowing like a bubble;<end_line>
in the everyday struggle<end_line>
