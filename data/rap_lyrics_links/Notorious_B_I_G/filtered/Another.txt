<verse_start>
Uh-huh, uhh, uhh<end_line>
I know he don't treat you like I treat you<end_line>
Time to explain your game is see-through<end_line>
Sex is lethal, I ain't gon' lie<end_line>
Means to get ya back, I ain't gon' try<end_line>
Like this y'all, my girl sucked anotha nigga dick y'all<end_line>
Light skinned with the chromed out six y'all<end_line>
Thought they was creepin, took trips to V-A every third weekend<end_line>
While you was sleepin, he hit you on the box<end_line>
Sixty-nine code non-stop<end_line>
Shoulda left ya then, but my heart said not<end_line>
You knew too much, the relationship grew too much<end_line>
You knew about the crack vials, means to be trialed<end_line>
Way I hid dough under the bathroom tile<end_line>
Waited for a while, thought you was my right thing<end_line>
Then things got frightening<end_line>
Peep the scene, sorta like Sam Rothstein<end_line>
Guess you Ginger, huh, go figure<end_line>
Never thought you could be a gold digger<end_line>
Take my dough and spend with the next nigga<end_line>
Asked my man Trigga, my ace boom coon<end_line>
Told me cut the bitch off 'fore the shit balloon<end_line>
Now I'm like Brandy, "Sittin in My Room"<end_line>
Pissy drunk listenin to Stylistic tunes<end_line>
Or the O'Jays, thinkin bout the old days<end_line>
My nigga's like, "Fuck that bitch, go play<end_line>
Baller, did she beep you?  Don't call her<end_line>
Guess who I seen, that freak bitch Paula<end_line>
She was askin bout ya whereabouts<end_line>
Here's the digits, I know you can wear that out<end_line>
Tear that out the frame, ya game so tight<end_line>
You'll be all fuckin night"<end_line>
