What you expected from his next of kin<end_line>
I'm loco bro, but ain't no Mexican<end_line>
I got nines in the bedroom, glocks in the kitchen<end_line>
A shotty by the shower if you wanna shoot me while I'm shittin<end_line>
The lesson from the Smith and Wessun is depressin<end_line>
Niggaz keep stressin, the same motherfuckin question<end_line>
How many shots does it take, to make my heart stop<end_line>
and my body start to shake, if I should die before I wake<end_line>

Love, the flesh, my blood's pourin through<end_line>
This, can be, reality<end_line>
Wake, up, my dead face I see<end_line>
My dead face I see, my dead face I SEE!!<end_line>

On your mark, get set, when I spark you're wet<end_line>
Look how dark it get when you're marked wit death<end_line>
Should I, start your breath or should I let you die<end_line>
If he start to cry, ask why?<end_line>
Lyrically, I'm worshipped, don't front, the word's sick<end_line>
You cursed it, but rehearsed it<end_line>
I drop unexpectedly like bird shit<end_line>
You herbs get, stomped quickly for raw T's and show money<end_line>
Don't forget the publishin, I'm punishin<end_line>
I'm done wit them, son I'm surprised you run wit them<end_line>
I think they got cumin, cause they nothin but bitch<end_line>
Tryna blow up like nitro wit dynamite sticks<end_line>
Mad I smoke, but yo I rock diamonds that's sick<end_line>
Got paper off my flow, ride wit my own click<end_line>
Take chicks to Cairo, layin wit yo' bitch<end_line>

Fuck you prick, when I see you I'ma..<end_line>

My dead face I see, my dead face I SEE!!<end_line>
