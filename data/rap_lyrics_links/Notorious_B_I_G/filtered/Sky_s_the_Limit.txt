I ain't have ta be in school by ten, I was in<end_line>
Began to encounter, wit my counter-parts<end_line>
On how ta burn the block apart, break it down into section<end_line>
Drugs by the selection<end_line>
Some use pipes, others use in-jec-tions<end_line>
Syringe sold seperately, Frank the deputy<end_line>
Quick to grab my Smith-n-Wessun, like my dick was missin<end_line>
To protect my position, my corner, my layer<end_line>
While we out here, say the hustlas prayer<end_line>
If the game shakes me or breaks me<end_line>
I hope it makes me a better man<end_line>
Take a better stand<end_line>
Put money in my moms hand<end_line>
Get my daughter this college plan, so she don't need no man<end_line>
