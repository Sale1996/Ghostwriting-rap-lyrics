Remember back in the days, when niggaz had waves<end_line>
Gazelle shades, and corn braids<end_line>
Pitchin pennies, honies had the high top jellies<end_line>
Shootin skelly, motherfuckers was all friendly<end_line>
Loungin at the barbeques, drinkin brews<end_line>
with the neighborhood crews, hangin on the avenues<end_line>
Turn your pagers, to nineteen ninety three<end_line>
Niggaz is gettin smoked G, believe me<end_line>
Talk slick, you get your neck slit quick<end_line>
Cause real street niggaz ain't havin that shit<end_line>
Totin techs for rep, smokin blunts in the project<end_line>
hallways, shootin dice all day<end_line>
Wait for niggaz to step up on some fightin shit<end_line>
We get hype and shit and start lifin shit<end_line>
So step away with your fist fight ways<end_line>
Motherfucker this ain't back in the days, but you don't hear me though<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
No more cocoa leave-io, one two three<end_line>
One two three, all of this to me, is a mystery<end_line>
I hear you motherfuckers talk about it<end_line>
But I stay seein bodies with the motherfuckin chalk around it<end_line>
And I'm down with the shit too<end_line>
For the stupid motherfuckers wanna try to use Kung-Fu<end_line>
Instead of a Mac-10 he tried scrappin<end_line>
Slugs in his back and, that's what the fucks happenin<end_line>
when you sleep on the street<end_line>
Little motherfuckers with heat, want ta leave a nigga six feet deep<end_line>
And we comin to the wake<end_line>
To make sure the cryin and commotion ain't a motherfuckin fake<end_line>
Back in the days, our parents used to take care of us<end_line>
Look at em now, they even fuckin scared of us<end_line>
Callin the city for help because they can't maintain<end_line>
Damn, shit done changed<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
If I wasn't in the rap game<end_line>
I'd probably have a key knee deep in the crack game<end_line>
Because the streets is a short stop<end_line>
Either you're slingin crack rock or you got a wicked jumpshot<end_line>
Shit, it's hard being young from the slums<end_line>
eatin five cent gums not knowin where your meals comin from<end_line>
And now the shit's gettin crazier and major<end_line>
Kids younger than me, they got the Sky grand Pagers<end_line>
Goin outta town, blowin up<end_line>
Six months later all the dead bodies showin up<end_line>
It make me wanna grab the nine and the shottie<end_line>
But I gotta go identify the body<end_line>
Damn, what happened to the summertime cookouts?<end_line>
Everytime I turn around a nigga gettin took out<end_line>
Shit, my momma got cancer in her breast<end_line>
Don't ask me why I'm motherfuckin stressed, things done changed<end_line>
<verse_end>
