<verse_start>
You see, I don't sweat these hoes<end_line>
I keep 'em in flavors like Timbos and Girbauds<end_line>
Bitches just like to play the merry-go<end_line>
It was me, Dee, the MPV<end_line>
The blunts and brew thang, knockin' some Wu-tang<end_line>
M-E-T-H-Oh shit, look at them lips and them hips on that bitch<end_line>
Dee hit the dip, so I can drop my mackadocious shit<end_line>
Light the blunt clip, and recognize a pimp<end_line>
Needless to speak, the Gee's obsolete<end_line>
Don't sleep! Banged the skins in a week<end_line>
On the creep up the avenue<end_line>
I seen her on the block, who she rappin' to?<end_line>
That's my nigga Dee, damn he got Gee<end_line>
Now she fuckin him and fuckin me, see<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Now I play her far like a moon play a star<end_line>
She still sweat me hard 'cause I'm a rap star<end_line>
I be cruisin up the block, I be passin her<end_line>
Pimpin hard with the female passenger<end_line>
And the only time I call her to hang<end_line>
Is when me and Dee blunted up, pissy, schemin on a gang-bang<end_line>
She should've used her intuition<end_line>
Then she wouldn't be classified in that position, listen<end_line>
She's sayin I dissed her 'cause I'm fuckin her sister<end_line>
A message to the fellas, that really gets 'em pissed, uh<end_line>
But she started that fuckin family<end_line>
She fucked my man Dee, so why she mad at me?<end_line>
Plus your sister look better than you<end_line>
Give head better than you, pussy get wetter than you<end_line>
So break the fuck out like a rash<end_line>
I'm glad I ain't spend no cash to hit yo' nasty ass<end_line>
<verse_end>
