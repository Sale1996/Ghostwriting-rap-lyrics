Some say the x, make the sex<end_line>
Spec-tacular, make me lick you from yo neck<end_line>
To yo back, then ya, shiverin, tongue deliverin<end_line>
Chills up that spine, that ass is mine<end_line>
Skip the wine and the candlelight, no Cristal tonight<end_line>
If its alright with you, we fuckin<end_line>
Deja vu, the blunts sparked, finger fuckin in the park<end_line>
Pissy off Bacardi Dark<end_line>
Remember when I used to play between yo legs<end_line>
You begged for me to stop because you know where it would head<end_line>
Straight to yo mother's bed<end_line>
At the Mariott, we be lucky if we find a spot<end_line>
Next to yo sister, damn I really missed the<end_line>
way she used to rub my back, when I hit that<end_line>
Way she used to giggle when yo ass would wiggle<end_line>
Now I know you used to suites at the Parker Meridian<end_line>
Trips to the Carribean, but tonight, no ends<end_line>

Girl you look fine, like a windface Rolex, you just shine<end_line>

Let me hit that from behind, which wall you wanna climb<end_line>
My styles genuine, girl I love you long time<end_line>
I got you pinned up, with yo fuckin limbs up<end_line>
All because you like the way my Benz was rimmed up<end_line>
Bitch keep yo shin up, please watch me do thee<end_line>
Nasty, like it when you make it move fast mommy<end_line>
I like it when you tro' it pon me<end_line>
No love makin, strictly back breakin<end_line>
Ceas' know, all his hoes, go to my door<end_line>
Then they go to his flo', to fuck some more<end_line>
So no, caviar, sharp bar, uh uh<end_line>
Strictly sex that's pretty and left over spaghetti<end_line>
I know you used to slow CD's and Don P's<end_line>
But tonight its eight tracks and six-packs while I hit that<end_line>
<verse_end>
