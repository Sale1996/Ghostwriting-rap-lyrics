[Intro: sample of "Zombie" by The Cranberries]
In your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh

[Eminem]
I'm packin up my shit, as much shit in the car as I can fit
And I'm just drivin as far as I can get
Away from these problems 'til all of my sorrows I forget
What's tomorrow like? Cause tonight, I'm startin life again
Get to the corner and stop, fuck am I goin?
Besides psycho when I fantasize startin my whole life over
Yeah right, oh and I might go and
get hypnotized so I don't even recognize no one
I try to look alive but there's nothin like holdin
your head up high when you're dead inside and I just hide, so in
case you're wonderin why are my insides showin
Cause I done spilled all my guts, and those are mine so I'm
pickin 'em up and stuffin 'em back
Fuck it, I've done enough in this rap shit, +Recovery+ brought me nothin but back
to right where I was and perhaps
This coulda been my victory lap, if I wasn't on the verge of +Relapse+

[Chorus: sample of "Zombie" by The Cranberries]
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh

[Eminem]
It seems, to be the reoccurring main thing, the shit I
would daydream as a kid I, was 18, I went
from an irate teenager to, still raging as an adult
Amazing, back then I put anything into the
rhyme, whether it was sad, mad, happy or angry I spit it
The mainstream, I hit it, yay me, I did it
Did what? Hailie, baby, I didn't
mean to make you 80 percent of
what I rapped about, maybe I shoulda
did a better job at separating Shady and enter-
-taining from real life, but this dang thing is still the
hardest thing to explain, it's the craziest shit I
ever seen and back then it was like I ain't even
bothered taking into consideration
you one day being older and may hear me say things, I did it
Aim me, and be, just ain't me
Okay, so ladies and gentle-
-men let's strip away, everything and see the main reason that I
feel like a lame piece of shit I sound cranky, and bitter
Complain, beef and bicker 'bout the same things cause when I
look at me, I don't see what they see, I feel a-
-shamed, greedy and lately I've been contemplating escaping to get a-
-way and go wherever this road takes me
It's making me crazy what's in my

[Chorus]
