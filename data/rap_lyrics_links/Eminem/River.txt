[Intro: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washin over me
Well little one, I don't want to admit to somethin
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are fallin like the rain
So let the river run

[Eminem]
He's comin home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin onto the next? Ac-
-tually, just shit on my last chick, and she has what my +Ex-Lacks+
Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back, knife in hand
Says their relationship's hangin by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man/Spider-Man
And I know she's usin me, to try to play him
I don't care, hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said "Bye Suzanne"
after the first night, but tonight I am

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water
Feel it washin over me
Well little one, I don't want to admit to somethin
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth in my lies now are fallin like the rain
So let the river run

[Eminem]
A one-night stand, turned to two-night stand
It was "Come sunlight, scram," now we hug tight, and
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
don't want this to hurt but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the stu-
-dio like hole-in-the-wall diners, don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turnin into's
irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you, took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin the wound, cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
to use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
Fuck!

[Chorus]

[Eminem] + (Ed Sheeran)
My name's (ohh) my name's (ohh)
River (ohh) river run
Call me (ohh) call me (ohh)
River (ohh, we'll let the river run)
Always the bridesmaid, never "The bride, hey!"
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
and deceit was an enclave, I'd be swervin in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate like I'm slidin on ice, maybe
That's why I may, have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate, my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?

[Chorus]

[Eminem over Chorus]
I'm sorry
I fucked up
