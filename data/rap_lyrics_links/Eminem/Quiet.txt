[Intro: Mr. Porter]
Uh, oh yeah
Uh, oh yeah
Oh, oh yeah
Uh

[Chorus: Mr. Porter] + (Royce Da 5'9")
See I done said so much - so much
I done said so much that I ain't even got that much to say
I done cried so much - so much
I done cried so much that I can't even wipe the tears away - quiet
(That's how it be when you come up around gangsters) Quiet
(Silence be the same color my chain is) Quiet
(That's how it be comin up on my block) Quiet
(Silence be the same color my watch) Quiet

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Hold up, shhh, keep your mouth shut
Them street sweepers'll come through and clean your house up
Us Detroit niggaz call that yellow-tapin the scene
My South niggaz call it chalked up
You know we put money on it when it's real
They call me Mr. Fifty a Head, I'm sendin ten niggaz to kill ya at ten until
Every man got an expiration date, and a price
All my revolvers got the spinnin +Wheel+
I make the Lord you pray to appear tonight like Vanna White
Them racketeerin charges startin to look like a tennis deal
I call the garden in my back yard Garden of Weeden
lookin like some spinach spiel - but still I'm dealin raw
From sellin to buyin weed, actually I'm stealin all
I'm the last of a dyin breed that I'm out here killin off
Four of my closest friends don't know their papas
so I pull out rows of dollars to show 'em these real forefathers peelin off
Get money!

[Chorus]

[Tiara]
Hold up, shhh, I should've been born deaf mute
Talkin gets you stripped naked
Shootin at your feet dancin 'til Chip and Dale's at your +Rescue+
If, there's a wrinkle then there's iron to press you
Look, time is money, I'm on EST
Keep playin, light up your block like Christmas E-V-E
I'm the +New Edition+ of +Poison+, BBD
For that bread my niggaz'll stamp you, EBT
I let a hot line sting 'em, you in the cop's line singin
Ever since you left the city now they +Hotline's Blingin+
Hmm, seen a paddy wagon cruisin and I'm deducin
that they are only movin cause all the rumors that you in
If I had to draw a conclusion all the gangsters we losin
is because of the illusion, you are not in collusion
with the boys that's wearin blue and it's causin all this confusion
And they wouldn't even know but y'all tellin what niggaz doin!

[Chorus]

[Royce Da 5'9"]
I'm goin on an AK-a-thon
Throw a Bible at some shallow waters right before I go and pray upon
Double parked, custom license plates says I can pay a fine
I ain't in the zone, I'm in the motherfuckin lay-up line
Speakin of lay-ups, we do homi's based on how we doin
Last lay up line I was in was a body viewin
I'm preoccupied with the Earth's ills
Good herbals, first meal was milk, I milk these niggaz for my first mil'
Full circle, off of just talkin I could tell types
But I'll still give that bitch my whip test
If she not exhausted then she can easily tailpipe
Playin that dirty hand I was dealt, don't complain to me nigga, tell Christ
I'm standin over coffins with hammers and screws, with a sickness
Man-a-cure/Manicure wouldn't hand a nigga these nails right
Only hand-me-down I had was inherited head lice
But nothing's more bugged out as my head size, I live twice
E'ry day, one for the body of Martin Luther King, I'm dead nice
Rest call me Malcolm, they want me dead because I'm dead right
Ask me to spell die, I'ma accidentally spell dice
I can shelve a label with my shelf life
I'm a rider but still I steal bikes
Out of the field terrorizin reptiles and field mice
I'm cut, like I'm touched, a blind man with Braille spikes
I'm deep, I could break up a motherfuckin whale fight!
Get money!

[Chorus]
