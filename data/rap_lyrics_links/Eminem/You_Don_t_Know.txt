[Intro: 50 Cent]
Who run it?
You know, you actin like you don't know
We run it
You know but you actin like you don't know
Who run it?
You know, you actin like you don't know
We run it
You know but you actin like you don't know

You know, you actin like you don't know
I tear the club up fo sho
This flow is gon bring more dough
And you know but you actin like you don't know

[50 Cent]
Now homie I say I run it (run it) cause I'm in control
Hypnotic, Hennessey, a couple shots of Patron
I have you feelin aight, I get you high as a kite
Party poppin shawty says she comin with me tonight
I ain't shoulder leanin, I ain't snappin and poppin
Either I'm bobbin ma head or I'm just stadin their watchin
I'm a hustler I hustle, you can tell that I'm paid
And I protect what I got, I'm in the house with my blade
Nigga you front you gone get it, ok now maybe I said it
Cause I want you to tridd-ip, yeah I be on that shidd-it
You should see when I'm stuntin, I flash the stones you be wantin
Push the whip, see me rollin, you can tell that I'm holdin
I'm just doin ma thang, you know the Units the game
I got my grimy Shady with me you front you gonna have to get me off your ass
I pay the lawsuit and laugh (haha)
It's not a big deal it's nothing but some cash (let's go)

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Who run it?
You know, you actin like you don't know
I tear the club up fo sho
This flow is gon bring more dough
And you know but you actin like you don't know
Who run it?
You know, you actin like you don't know
I tear the club up fo sho
This flow is gon bring more dough
And you know but you actin like you don't know

[Eminem]
When me and Fif got together to do this music
The more we became enveloped we just developed a fellowship through it
It's no pretend shit, it's friendship, me nemesis is your nemesis
Ain't for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images
But this shit is no gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out
When there's beef you jus' gotta know when to butt in and butt out
If there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it
It usually just evolves into one big brawl and we all get involved in it
We should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit
And wear it like a badge with honor, pass it around and share it
And let it go to whoever's holdin the most current people on their shoulders
And their soldiers got their backs til it's over
But tonight, we ain't comin here to beef with nobody
We came to party, Banks, Cashis and Mr. Ferrari
So is Shady Aftermizzath back in that ass? You izzask
Come izzon, what kind of fizzucked up quizzestion is 'at?

[Chorus: 50 Cent, Eminem]
Who run it?
You know, you actin like you don't know
I tear the club up fo sho
This flow is gon bring more dough
And you know but you actin like you don't know
Who run it?
I say you know, you actin like you don't know
I tear the club up fo sho
This flow is gon bring more dough
And you know but you actin like you don't know

[Cashis]
Pistol play ricochet, see where the victim lay
Slumped over bleeding J.F.K
H.K. to your chest plate cave
I'll ride to the death, do you rep that way?
Forever ima be a Shady 7-4 gangsta
Plus I survive everything you got in that chamber
I thrive off of danger, jumpin in all beef
You keep talking shit now the squad called me

[Lloyd Banks]
Enough holdin back the steam, Em let off a magazine
Dappadon Cappa queen mixed in with Cashis creams
Started off with half a dream, developed into what you see
Telling ain't my cup of tea, can't tell I'm a fuckin G
I'm on automatic when I'm at it, start static
And you splattered, shit shattered, I'm a walkin bitch magnet
Spit it how I love it, live it all the way to the limit
And I'm always on my pivot for my digits, you dig it?

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Who run it?
You know, you actin like you don't know
I tear the club up fo sho
This flow is gon bring more dough
And you know but you actin like you don't know
Who run it?
You know, you actin like you don't know
I tear the club up fo sho
This flow is gon bring more dough
And you know but you actin like you don't know
Who run it?

[Tony Yayo]
You know who this is
Shady, G-Unit, Aftermath
Lloyd Bands, Cashis, Marshall Mathers, Ferrari F-50
It's a movement, you can't stop it
Talk of New York, Tony Yayo...
