[Intro: Eminem]
Hands up, officer don't shoot
Then pull up your pants up, promise you won't loot
We may never understand each other, it's no use
We ain't ever gonna grasp what each other goes through

[Eminem]
Black boy, black boy, we ain't gonna lie to you
Black boy, black boy, we don't like the sight of you
Pull up on the side of you
Window rolled down, profile, then we wonder why we see this side of youuuu!
Probably comin from the dope house
We could let you slide but your tail light is blew, out
We know you're hidin that Heidi Klum
on you, another drug charge homie, it's back inside for you!
And just in case a chase might ensue, we got that tried and true
Pistol drew right at you, we'd be delighted to
unload it in your back then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you
Fucked up, but what the fuck am I to do?
I keep tellin myself keep doin like you're doin
No matter how many lives you ruin
It's for the red, white and blue, time to go find a new
one and split his head right in two, no one's ever indicted you
Why? Cause you're a
 
[Chorus: Eminem]
White boy, white boy, you're a rock star
{"My momma talkin to me tryna tell me how to live"}
White boy, white boy, in your cop car
{"But I don't listen to her cause my head is like a sieve"}
White boy, white boy, you're untouchable
{"The world's coming to an end, I don't even care"}
Nobody can tell me shit cause I'm a
{"Cause I'm a big rock star..."}

[Eminem]
Black boy, black boy, we don't get your culture and
We don't care what our government's done to fuck you over, man
Don't tell us your attitude's a result of that
Balderdash, where'd you get the chip on your shoulder at?
Why you kickin that soda can?
Pull your pants up, we 'bout to roll up and
throw your ass in the van cuffed, you don't have to know our plans
or what our intentions are, our cards are close to our chest, you better show your hands!
And put our minds more at ease
Or get shot in the thyroid, comply or die, boy
We're fightin a crime war
Here come the swine, tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities
That's what we call 'em pigsties for
They're like eyesores to police
Talked to like you're just a piece of trash
Feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me
As I kick these facts and, get these mixed reactions
As this beat backspins, it's like we're drifting back in-
-to the '60s, havin
black skin is risky cause this keeps happenin
Throughout history African-Americans have been treated like shit
And I admit there have been times where it's been embarrassin
to be a
 
[Chorus]

{*beat changes*}

[Eminem]
Seems like, the average life span of, a white man
is more than twice than a, black life span
I, wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner
I feel like checkin out on life, can't e-scape, this circumstance
I'd rather, hear 'em say "Die N-word," than Die Antwoord
Ninja, now it's better disguised banter
But that's life, strapped
Cause we're strapped financially and can't find answers
We're applyin but McDonald's, seems to, be the only franchise that'll hire
So how can we have higher standards?
As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter
We fight back with violence but acts like that are
black eyes on the movement, which makes black lives madder
at cops, and cops madder
That's why it's at a, stalemate
And can't arrive at a compromise so it's Black Ops
I wonder if we hire more, black cops, the crap stops
The block is our back yards, officers, not the crack spot
Call the attack dogs off of us
Man, you always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop
And bad cops, fuck it up, for the good cops
And man stop, sendin white cops
into black neighborhoods, who ain't acclimated to 'em
Like that's the way to do it
Who seen some fuckin videos of rappers wavin guns
Ain't know nobody black, so they act afraid of us
And that's racism, the fear that a black face gives 'em
A subconscious racist, wait, why are there black neighborhoods?
Cause America segregated us
Designated us to an area, separated us
Section-Eight'd us, when we tear it up's
the only time attention's paid to, us, and education, sucks
And every day's a-no-ther Freddie Grey for, us
A levy breaks or, fuzz, why is it?
They treat us like dryer lint
We just want a safe environment for our kids, but can't escape the sirens
Don't take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in
the poverty that we face so the crime rate's the highest in
the lowest classes, it's like a razor wire fence
And we're trapped in, these racial biases
that plague our society, which makes our anxiety levels raise
every time we see a devil's face
Lions, tigers and bears, oh my; it's more like billy clubs and, gats
And we really love it when you think we're guilty cause we're, black
"But you kill each other, facts
You peel each other's, caps, for silly stuff like, hats!"
Single mother strugglin through substance abuse
while people with nothin to lose shoot each other for shoes
Fuck your Republican views
Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, where the fuck are the boots?
And streets act as a narrator
Don't gotta read comics, or be that into characters
Just to see that, just to be black, you better be strapped with a derringer
Or be +Capped-in America+, like Steve Rogers
Cause no one oversees, these cops and
All we see is 'em beat charges
We done seen 'em beat Rodney King unconscious and got off
So we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings
... Just keep marchin
... 'til we reach Congress
But they're gonna say you're tryin to take an irrational stance
if you try to slander the flag but somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb
So they called it a Kaepernick tantrum
if you don't stand for the National Anthem
We raise it, you better praise it or you'll be made to feel
like a traitor we'll, treat you like Rodney Dangerfield
Home of the brave is still, racist 'ville
So this whole nation feels like a plantation field
In a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals
that had its Natives killed
Got you singin this "Star-Spangled" spiel
to a piece of cloth that represents the +Land of the Free+ that made people slaves to BUILD!
