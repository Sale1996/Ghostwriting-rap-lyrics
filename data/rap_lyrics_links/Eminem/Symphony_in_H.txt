Yeah, y-y-yeah, y-y-y-yeah, yeah

Don't ask me what's up with the hoes, I'm still workin the kinks out
Love stinks, that explains all this anger that's spillin out
And I ain't chillin out
Got an Oscar but I'm still a +Grouch+
I use it as a doorstop and a prop for the broken leg for the couch
Yelawolf, Shady, Tony, Touch, Slaughterhouse
Yeah the SWAT team 'bout to break them flyswatters out
Go to hell in a drought, break ice waters out
Nice try shorty wop, we can window shop, the jewelry store
But Christ for that price could've bought a house
Besides, only thing I ever had iced out
is my heart since I started out!
It's F.Y.I. if ya ain't knowin
What? Go with you where? Nah, ain't goin
Oh wait, you want a date, oh well
In that case hoe it's June 8th, OH and
Kinda like Beethoven
composin a symphony of hate, so much hate woven
into these raps, he stitches a bitch, straight sewin
Shit I'm beginnin to hate clothing
I hate overalls cause they remind me of hoes
For Christ's sake, they're shaped like an H, whoa
And, you know what else starts with H though?
Hockey, shit, thought I had the place flowin
I hate to put you on ice
But you already had three periods in 60 minutes, great goin
Plus you remind me of cocaine, hoe
You always in the mirror with your face so
I feel an urge to put you all in a line and
chop you with a razor blade yo - wait, I'm an a-hole
Devil with a halo
Hell yeah I'd nail J-Lo, to the railroad~!
Say I won't! Better hope you can stay afloat
when I take the wind out your sailboat
But, I ain't playin yo
Dope as Shady? Don't kid yourself, bitch you ain't even a baby goat
