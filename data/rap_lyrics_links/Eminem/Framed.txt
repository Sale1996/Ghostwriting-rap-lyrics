Feelin kinky, lip syncing to Too $hort's "Freaky Tales" (biatch!)
Havin creepy visions of whiskey drinking
Envisioning sneaking into where Christie Brinkley dwells
I know this is risky thinking but I wanna +stick+ her like she decals
But when murdering females, better pay attention to these details
or you could be derailed, better wear at least three layers
of clothing or be in jail
If you get scratched because your DNA'll, be all up under her fingernails
Man, he hears you, I don't think he cares
He gives a fuck, even his pinky swears
Three personalities burstin out of me, please beware
Her TV blares, can't hear the creaking stairs
She's unaware in no underwear, she's completely bare
Turns around and screams I remember distinctly, I said "I'm here to do sink repairs"
Chop her up, put her body parts in front of Steven Avery's
trailer and leave 'em there
But hey man

[Chorus: Eminem]
I was, FRAAAAAMED, I know what this looks like
Officers, please just give me one minute
I think I can ex-PLAAAAAIN, I ain't murder nobody
I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to enter-TAAAAAIN, "How come your shirt is so bloody?"
There's a missin person, so what? He's
got nothing, to do with, MEEEEE
I'm almost certain I was, fraaaamed

[Eminem]
Woke up it was dawn, musta knew somethin was wrong
Think I'm becomin a monster cause of the drugs that I'm on
Donald Duck's on as the Tonka Truck in the yard
But dawg, how the fuck is Ivanka Trump in the trunk of my car?
Gotta get to the bottom of it to try to solve it
Must go above and beyond, cause it's incumbent upon
me, plus I feel somewhat responsible for the dumb little blonde
girl, that motherfuckin baton twirler that got dumped in the pond
Second murder with no recollection of it
Collectin newspaper articles, cuttin up sections from it
Memory's too fucked to remember, destructive temper
Cut my public defender's jugular then stuck him up in a blender
'Nother dismembered toddler discovered this winter probably
Cause the disassembled body was covered up in the snow since the month of November oddly
I'm wanted for questioning
Them son of a bitches probably just wanna pin this on me
But hey man

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
Still on the loose they, spotted me inside McDonald's Tuesday
In a Toronto Blue Jays cap lookin like your college roommate
With Rihanna, Lupe, Saddam Hussein, Bobby Boucher
Or was it Cool J? The cops is on a goose chase
Just escaped from the state pen for {rapin} eight women who hate men
Don't make it no weirder, I'm naked when I break in your basement
Under your baby's playpen, I lay and wait adjacent
Facin the door, remaining patient while staying complacent, blatant
Sexual implications are continuing to get thrown
Insinuations are placed in, little riddles and poems
Left on your pillow in hopes, that when you get home
You'll get the hint hoe, I'm in your window
But it never occurred to me I could describe a murder scene
in a verse and be charged with first degree
Cause it just happened to match up perfectly
with the massacre or the Burger King burglary
No officer, you see

[Chorus]
