[Eminem]
We never saw from each other's sides, or eye to eye
Just eye for eye, lie for lie, fight or flight
So much baggage need a luggage rack, but we carry on with our public spats
And our feud's up, back in the news; love taps when I dissed you
like it was fun, actually used to run, back to the booth, jump back in the studio
Give you a tongue lashing then you, laughed at a stomach tat with the tomb-
-stone, it was funny back in our youth, but then it wasn't after we knew
that we were done, and actually through (actually through)
But if there's one, fraction of truth, if it could be spun, back I would do
so many things different, cause it was such, a dumbass excuse
You hit me once, and that I would use to continue the pattern of abuse
Why did I punch back? Girls, your dad is a scumbag, I'm confused
Because

[Chorus: X Ambassadors]
How come, you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father, a great dad, but a bad husband?

[Eminem]
You were the beat I loved with a writer's block
The line that's hot, that I forgot - we laughed a little, cried a lot
I'll never forget when you came home and you held Hailie, day before you went to jail and daily
How we'd wait for that mail lady, or by the phone for Mom to call
And I watched you pull yourself up and we decided on givin it one more try despite it all
You're my lightning rod, when my sky gets dark, I'm your shiny rocks
in that tiny box when we tied the knot, when we broke the knot
Every line we crossed, we were supposed to not, every time we fought, the insults that got
thrown too far, words that we said that we didn't mean, the words that we meant that we didn't say
The ones that we thought that we shoulda said, letters written that we coulda read
Which maybe woulda lead to some good instead and had this put to bed
But I'd be lyin still if I said I wasn't sittin here askin myself

[Chorus]

[Interlude: X Ambassadors] + (Eminem)
{"Dad!"} (You said)
Forever be a hero, in my eyes (I reply)
But there's always another side
to a good father, a great dad, but a bad husband

[Eminem]
We brought out the worst in each other, someone had to make the sparring end
Cause I loved you but I hated that me, and I don't wanna see that side again
But I'm sorry Kim, more than you could ever comprehend
Leavin you was fuckin harder than, sawing off a fuckin body limb
Once upon a time we're all we had, maybe that's what drew us to each other, it was true love
Shit we never knew was possible, we might have loved each other too much
And maybe that's what made us do what we did to each other, all the screw-ups
cause you always thought that you was
more in love with me and I was thinkin I was more in love than you was
For all the times that we thought it worked, 'til we saw how wrong we were
When the dust settles now and all the dirt
If I touch the rawest nerve, all I want is for us not to hurt
And it's been an exhaustive search, to find the words
But I just heard, "Mockingbird", and got the urge, to jot some verses
and thoughts, the purpose was not, to stir up, or open wounds, I've caused a few
And so have you, or argue whose, fault it was, partly yours
Partly mine, but really no one's, this is so tough, I'm gettin choked up
Oh fuck it, we both suck; we broke up, got back together
We both thought, we had forever, not bad people, just bad together
We were so nuts, back-stabbed each other, another blow struck
But there's no duckin this blow cause, it's over, and it's closure
But, I'm not so sure how to close this, I just don't know
how some people can be so good at one thing and so fucked at a whole 'nother
Shit, it's no wonder

[X Ambassadors]
How come

[Chorus]
