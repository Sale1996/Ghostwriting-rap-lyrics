[Chorus]
Now out of all the women in the place
You got me staring at your pretty face
And what that body I can truely say
That U R The One, U R The One, U R The One
Amazed by the way that you shake them hips
Shaking ya ass all on my dick
I get aroused by them sexy lips
Cause U R The One, U R The One, the only one that can move...

[Swifty]
And you wonder why I call you every day of the week
And have the operator breaking on yo line when you speak
And I can say I'ma make you mine in a blink
You nominated just for your behind and I'm geek
You a thug with yo best of friend mud wrestelin
Sitting in the corner with a mug and a cup of Gin
See me looking for you and yo in in the pens see I hug you dirty
You confronting me for flirting
You wanted me to suddenly my company's a burden
But I won't jump off balchony and how can I be hurting
I'm just playing with you and it's working
Yo friends can't save you, they faking like they nurses

[Bizarre]
The first time I saw you up in them Guess
You the only reason I use Federal Express
Shit.. I don't be having no packages
Now I'm getting dressor lamps and big mattresses
I go crazy when I smell your odor
I just wanna pick you up and take you to Ponderosa
Steak and potatoes whatever you want
Alright just the buffet my publshing check didn't come
You don't care about D12 you don't know about Bizarre
All you know is that I'm weird and I wear a Wonder Bra
THat's fine... I just wanna make you mine
Niggaz say you a 3 I think you a dime

[Chorus]

[Proof]
I love the way your body gridin all in my face
Only thing that's on your mind is which wallet to rape
Yo ass look so perfect with your thong on your waist
Built like a stallion you belong in a race
Got money by the barrell king kong in the place
Movie and a dinner is as long as I wait
Hey I ain't in your ear all talking dates
Got you dizzy off the crissy you ain't walking straight
Got a room key in yo booty and lets cultivate
You so pretty love them titties they soft and fake
Bring yo friends damn you skin smell like coffee cake
Yo meet me at the place when you get off at 8

[Kuniva]
The way you moving got me bugging out
And you quit to take off your jacket and slug it out
We thug it out pouring 40s out, We give each other dap
In fact We both hate going out we both hate small gats
You the truth yo for real yo I love you to death
And if we break up I'ma stalk you and bug you to death
Until you scared to leave the house because you know I'm in the bushes
We went from hugs and kisses onto shoves and pushes
It's all love take it in stride I'm only joking with you
I don't get down like that, you know I'll never hit you
But still and yet if I ever feel I'm about to
I'll gently grab your shoulders +SHAKE THE SHIT OUT YOU+, girl..

[Chorus]

[Kon Artist]
I take 'em light skin, dark skin short and black
Attitudes sassy and they ass is fat
Corporate suburb but you can be a classy rat
Louis Vuitton cost too much to have a bag to match
Girl forget all that, I'm getting rich off rap
And you can be my A&R as long as you got my back
Sagittarius are entrepreneurs and that's a fact
And your birthday is seven days after mine correct?
Well that's two thing we got in common baby
Hope it ain't a problem that I'm involved with Shady
Cause come next year I will not be dating
Cause my plans to be with yo stanken ass ok, ok, ok

[Chorus]
