[Intro]
Psst... Hey, listen
I love my job, makes me feel like... Superman! (haha)
Can you fly? I can - wanna see?

[Chorus]
I.. am only entertainin' you, my
goal is to stimulate makin' you high
And take you and I to a place you can't see
But I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic so let me entertain you

(I'm here to save you
I've come here for the ride
So let me entertain you
And everything will be fine)

[Eminem]
My lyrical content is constantly under fire, no wonder why
Constantly bombed back to combat attacks to constant concepts
When lyrics are constantly took out of context
Failure to communicate with Congress has
Been a problem for the longest I guess but
Maybe one day we can make some progress
Food for thought see how long it takes to digest
Feelin' good when I should be ashamed
Shit I really shoulda fell but I stood, see I came
Like a flame in the night, like a ghost in the dark
There's a ray, there's a light, there's a hope, there's a spark
But when planets collide they'll never see eye-to-eye
Until they decide to set their differences aside
And this is why only one of us will survive
So children, follow my lead and feel the vibe because

[Chorus]
I am only entertainin' you
My goal is to stimulate makin' you high
And take you and I to a place you can't see
But I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic so let me entertain you

(I'm here to save you
I've come here for the ride
So let me entertain you
And everything will be fine)

[Eminem]
My music can be slightly amusin'
You shouldn't take lyrics so serious it might be confusin'
Tryin' to separate the truth from entertainment
It's stupid ain't it? I get sick just tryin' to explain it
See I could sit and argue wit' you but it goes beyond
Just bein' a snot, pointy-nosed, bleach blonde
'Cuz I came here to uplift, let your woes be gone
Tell 'em to get fucked and just mosey on
Constantly movin', constantly usin'
The Constitution as a form of restitution
Bless the children, nothin' less than brilliant
"Let Me Entertain You" like Robbie Williams
I'll be here when y'all are gone rebuildin'
World revolvin', still evolvin', still Slim
How many kids'll copy? Probably millions
But I'ma do this as a fuckin' hobby 'til then 'cuz

[Chorus]
I am only entertainin' you
My goal is to stimulate makin' you high
And take you and I to a place you can't see
But I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic so let me entertain you

(I'm here to save you
I've come here for the ride
So let me entertain you
And everything will be fine)

[Eminem]
My lyrical content contains subject matter that sucks up all these fucked up
Young kids at an alarmin' rate, common denominate
Add it up, and you see just why I dominate
I try to stimulate but kids emulate
and mimic every move you make, Slim, you great!
But wait, can't you see I'm only hear to entertain?
I gotta be the one to go against the grain
'Cuz now I see it, feel it, live it but it's inhumane
For me to see you be influenced then pretend you ain't
But they don't understand that I been through pain
If you get to know me I can be a friend you gain
But you can't just stand there and try to judge
It hurts but your jealousy prolly tears you up inside as much
And as such, I pleasure every button that I touch
I treasure every glutton that I punish in my lust but

[Chorus]
I am only entertainin' you
My goal is to stimulate makin' you high
And take you and I to a place you can't see
But I believe you can fly
I don't mean nobody harm I'm just partyin'
I'm not your dad, not your mom, not your guardian
Just a man who's on the mic so let me entertain you

(I'm here to save you
I've come here for the ride
So let me entertain you
And everything will be fine)

I've come here for the ride

And everything will be fine)
