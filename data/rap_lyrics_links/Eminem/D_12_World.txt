[Intro - Chorus]
Welcome to D12 World!
Where you can get anything from sex, X, to girls
Welcome to D12 World!
Prostitutes and guns, so fuck the real world
(Distorted) The world wants me to cope
I don't smoke crack, I don't smoke crack, I don't

[Bizarre]
Fuck the silly shit, I pull a mac milli quick
when D12 rock his summer it's over with
All these bitches and all these hoes
what the fuck you looking at me for? (You, nigga!)
Oh yeah, you like my chain, want to get your skinny ass up in the Range
I like my bitches raspy and nasty
I like a fat and nasty bitch named Ashley

[Swift]
I slide you dope without no procrastination
and you can watch me fuck up your imagination
I'm always drunk, and I fiend to smack hoes
I mean it, I leave them screamin' like pteorodactyls
This is our world.. 

[Kuniva]
We'd love to smack you
Hot lead flying with debris and schrapnel
Rippin' you to shreads, fuckin' up your tatoo
Break into your crib, take your records and plaques too

[Kon Artis]
D12 is, that's who!
Got you limpin'
Still poppin' somethin' purple with a bottle of gin bitch!
I fuck up your kinship, I lie in this shit
Peep, I stole your mom's jeep and crashed into my street

[Proof]
Crazy deranged, of course we Shady's gang
of course we wear clothes with holes and blood stains
No doubt, we shoot badges, born with ski masks
Chew on shro, rainbows, and p acids

[Chorus]
Welcome to D12 World!
Where you can get anything from sex, X, to girls
Welcome to D12 World!
Prostitutes and guns, so fuck the real world
Welcome to D12 World!
(Kon Artis Singing)
Welcome to D12 World!
Aaaaahhhhh!!!

[Kuniva]
Aiyyo
Niggaz be talkin' shit, but they layin' slugs? now
I graduated from techs, I grip a pump now
I used to be nice, but nice don't cut it
Now I over they wig, if they don't uppen my budget

[Bizarre]
Them D12 niggaz, they be quick to blast
I take my shower cap off, and whup your ass
Steppin' to us, you can't be the smartest
cause you'll get dropped like an Aftermath artist

[Swift]
They catch me mingling by a bitch with class
when she turn I'll be sprinkling some shit in her glass
What part of this you can't understand?
I'll emiliate a man, worse then making a band
(Kuniva - Don't be mistakin' that man)
(Kon Artis - He'll invite you over.)
Real fast, and pass your ass a glass of ebola

[Kon Artis]
I've been doing this for a minute
and I'm starting to see my little brother (??)
look more like a star then me
That's why I just started workin' out
Man, this shit ain't workin' out

[Chorus]
(Kon Artis conitinues singing till song fades)
