{*in the style of a telephone answering machine message*}
Em, it's Paul
Listen 
Joel just called me and he told me you're in the fucking back behind the studio
Shooting your gun off in the air like it's a shooting range
I told you not to fucking bring your gun around, like an idiot, outside of your home
You're gonna get yourself in trouble
DON'T bring your gun outside of your home, you can't carry it on you
Leave your fuckin' gun at home
{*hangs up*}
