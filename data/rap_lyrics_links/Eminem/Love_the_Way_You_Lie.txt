[Chorus: Rihanna]
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie..

[Eminem]
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now there's a steel knife, in my windpipe
I can't breathe but I still fight, while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate, it's like I'm huffin paint
And I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates
me, she fuckin hates me, and I love it, wait!
Where you goin? "I'm leavin you!" No you ain't!
Come back, we're runnin right back, here we go a-gain
It's so insane, cause when it's goin good it's goin great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, who's that dude? I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength

[Chorus] + "I love the way you lie"

[Eminem]
You ever love somebody so much, you can barely breathe when you're wit 'em
You meet, and neither one of you, even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin, yeah them chills used to get 'em
Now you're gettin fuckin sick of lookin at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em - never do nothin to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face spewin venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in them moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls ya
both, so they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya
Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again; now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane/pain

[Chorus] + "I love the way you lie"

[Eminem]
Now I know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love you're just as blinded, baby please
come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much, to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity, in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed I'll aim my fist, at the drywall
Next time, there won't be no next time
I apologize even though I know it's lies, I'm tired
of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin leave again, I'ma tie her
to the bed and set this house on fire
I'm just gonna

[Chorus] + "I love the way you lie"
