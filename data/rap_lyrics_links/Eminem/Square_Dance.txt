[Eminem]
People! (People!) It feels so good to be back (back)

{*Eminem vocally scratching these lines*}
Ladies and Gentlemen, introducing the new
and improved, you know who..
chk-who, chka-er-chk-er-chk-er-chk

[Eminem]
Never been the type to bend or budge
The wrong button to push, no friend of Bush
I'm the center piece, you're a Maltese
I'm a pitbull off his leash, all this peace talk can cease
All these people I had to leave in limbo
I'm back now, I've come to release this info
I'll be brief and let me just keep shit simple
+Cani-bitch+ don't want no beef with Slim
Nooooooo! Not even on my radar
So won't you please jump off my dick, lay off and stay off
And follow me as I put these crayons to chaos
from séance to séance, aw-er-aw-er-aw-eh-a

[Chorus 2X: Eminem]
C'mon now, let's all get on down
Let's do-si-do now, we gon' have a  - good ol' time
Don't be scurred, cause thurr ain't nothin to worry 'bout
Let your hurr down (and square dance with me)

[Eminem]
Let your hair down to the track, yeah kick on back (boo!)
The Boogiemonster of rap, yeah the man's back
with a plan to ambush this Bush administration
Mush the Senate's face in, push this generation
of kids to stand and fight for the right to say somethin
you might not like, this white hot light
that I'm under, no wonder I look so sunburnt
Oh no I won't leave no stone unturned
Oh no I won't leave, won't go nowhere
Do-si-do, oh-yo-ho, hello there
Oh yeah, don't think I won't go there
Go to Beirut and do a show there
Yeah you laugh till your motherfuckin ass gets drafted
While you're at band camp thinkin the crap can't happen
'Til you fuck around, get an anthrax napkin
Inside a package wrapped in Saran Wrap wrappin
Open the plastic and then you stand back gaspin
Fuckin assassins, hijackin Amtraks, crashin
All this terror, America demands action
Next thing you know, you've got Uncle Sam's ass askin
to join the Army or what you'll do for their Navy
You just a baby, gettin recruited at eighteen
You're on a plane now, eatin their food and their baked beans
I'm twenty-eight, they gon 
take you 'fore they take me
Crazy insane, or insane crazy?
When I say Hussein, you say Shady
My views ain't changed, still inhumane, wait
Arraigned two days late, the date's today, hang me!

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
Nothin moves me more than a groove that soothes me
Nothin soothes me more than a groove that boosts me
Nothin boosts me more, or suits me beautifully
There's nothin you can do to me, stab me shoot me
Psychotic hypnotic product, I got it the antibiotic
Ain't nobody hotter and so on and yada yada
God I talk a lotta hum-de-lay-de-la-la
Oochie walla-walla, um-di-da-dah da-dah but you gotta gotta
keep movin, there's more music to make
Keep makin new shit, produce hits to break
the monotony, what's gotten into me?
Drugs, rock, and Hennessey, thug like I'm 'Pac on my enemies
On your knees, got you under siege
Somebody you would give a lung to be
Hun-ga-ry, like a fuckin younger me
Fuck the fee, I can get you jumped for free
Yeah buddy, laugh it's funny, I have the money
to have you killed by somebody who has nothing
I'm past bluffing, pass the K-Y
Let's get ready for some intense, serious ass fucking!

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Dr. Dre, wants to square dance with me
Nasty Nas, wants to square dance with me
X to the Z, wants to square dance with me
Busta Rhymes, wants to square dance with me
+Cani-bitch+, won't square dance with me
+Cani-bitch+, won't square dance with me
+Canada-bis+, don't want no parts of me
Dirty Dozen, wants to square dance with you
Weeeeeeeeeeee-hahh!! Woo!
