Ecstacyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
In the air... I don't care
Can't tell me noth-iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing
I'm impaired... the worse for wear

[Chorus: Rihanna]
Cause I'm goin numb, I'm goin numb
I'm goin numb, I'm goin numb
I'm goin numb {"Let the champagne splash"}
I'm goin numb {"Let that man get cash"}
I'm goin numb {"Let that man get cash"}
I'm goin numb {"Let that man get cash"}
I'm goin numb, I'm goin numb
I'm goin numb, I'm goin numb
I'm goin numb {"Let the champagne splash"}
I'm goin numb {"Let that man get cash"}
I'm goin numb {"Let that man get cash"}
I'm goin numb {"Let that man get cash"}
I'm goin

[Rihanna]
Can't you seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Ain't it clear? ... I don't care
Get closer to meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
If you dare... I double dare

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
I'm plastered (drywall) look me in my (eyeball)
Do I look high? {"No"} I +Love the Way You Lie+ girl
Yeah yeah yeah; c'mere dear, I'm tryin to get closer to you
I'm motionin you to pull over boo
I'm the siren that you hear hear
I'm the butt police, and I'm lookin at your REAR REAR REAR!
But odds are I'ma end up in the back of a squad car by the end of tonight
I'm a rock star, get your wind up, it's attack of the oddball
Homie can ya show me where the gosh-darn bath salts are
cause I'm sick of sniffin asphalt, every thought's scarred
Got my pants off at the crosswalk in suspenders
And I can't feel my limbs cause

[Chorus]
