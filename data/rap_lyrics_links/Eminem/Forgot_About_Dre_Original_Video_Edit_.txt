[Dr. Dre]
Y'all know me, still the same O.G., but I been low key
Hated on by most these niggaz with no cheese, no deals and no Gs
No wheels and no keys, no boats, no snowmobiles, and no skis
Mad at me cause I can finally afford to provide my family with groceries
Got a crib with a studio and it's all full of tracks
To add to the wall full of plaques
Hanging up in the office in back of my house like trophies
Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze?
Whore please! - you better bow down on both knees
Who you think taught you to smoke trees?
Who you think brought you the oldies?
Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's and D.O.C's, then Snoop D-O-double-G's
And the group that said Mother-"Fuck Tha Police"
Gave you a tape full of dope beats
To bump when you stroll through in your hood
And when your album sales wasn't doing too good
Who's the Doctor they told you to go see?
Y'all better listen up closely
All you niggaz that said that I turned pop, or The Firm flopped
Y'all are the reason that Dre ain't been getting no sleep
So FUCK Y'ALL, all of y'all; if y'all don't like me - BLOW ME!
Y'all are gonna keep fucking around with me and turn me back to the old me

[Chorus: Eminem X2]
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothing comes out when they move their lips; just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre

[Eminem]
So what do you say to somebody you hate? (What?)
Or anyone trying to bring trouble your way?
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way? (YUP)
Then just study your tape of N.W.A.!
One day I was walking by, with a Walkman on
When I caught a guy, gave me an awkward eye (What you looking at?)
And strangled him off in the Parking lot, with his Karl KanisÂ©

[Skit #1: Eminem and some old white Woman]
[Woman:] Well uhh.. I know you!
[Eminem] Aiy fuck you, you stupid Bitch!
[Woman:] This is shame on you, this is..
[Eminem] Just SHUT the fuck up!
[Woman:] What you're doing to my lawn.. that's a shame of you..
[Eminem] Fucking bitch, Shut Up
[Woman:] I say stop do that to my house, and I ain't embarrass from you
Now you and him and your hoodlums, you're ruining my sleep
And my baby pie is awaken up because you woke him up
You do it always with him, you're miserable guys

[News Reporter]
We are just in front of the house where a fire broke out
In an upscale neighborhood as you can see this lady here.. (My dog, my
dog!)
(He'll be alright, we'll get your dog)
And this gentleman here, he claims that he has seen all happen
Can you tell me your name sir?

[Skit #2: Eminem]
Yeah, all I now is I'm upstairs, and I'm listening to my Will Smith CD
And I have seen all these flames going everywhere, you know what I'm saying?
Hey, hold on a minute, bitch! - Yo, aiy, hold on a minute
Yo, Detroit what! - Detroit what! - Detroit baby!

[News Reporter]
Okay thank you sir, ..reporting Live, on this channel eight
I'm Jane Yamamoto, back to the studio.

[Eminem]
And when the cops came through, me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches
And still weren't found out (RIGHT HERE)
From here on out, it's the Chronic two
Starting today and tomorrow's the new
And I'm still loco enough, to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew
(*Eminem's vocal turntable*)
Slim shady - hotter then a set of twin babies
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up, when the temp goes up to the mid 80s
Calling men ladies; sorry Doc but I been crazy
There's no way that you can save me
It's okay, go with him Hailey (Da-da)

[Chorus: Eminem]

[Dr. Dre]
If it was up to me, you motherfuckers would stop coming up to me
wit your hands out looking up to me, like you want something free
When my last CD was out, you wasn't bumping me
But now that I got this little company
Everybody wanna come to me like it was some disease
But you won't get a crumb from me
Cause I'm from the streets of (Compton, Compton ---> MC Ren)
I told them all - all them little gangsters
Who you think helped mold them all?
Now you wanna run around talking bout guns like I ain't got none
What you think, I sold them all? - cause I stay well off
Now all I get is hate mail all day saying Dre fell off
What cause I been in the lab with a pen and a pad
Trying to get this damn label off?
I ain't having that; this is the millennium of Aftermath
It ain't gon' be nothing after that
So give me one more platinum plaque and fuck rap!
You can have it back, so where's all the Mad Rappers at?
It's like a jungle in this habitat
But all you savage cats, know that I was strapped with gats
when you were cuddling a Cabbage Patch

[Chorus: Eminem]

[Dr. Dre] Who's Next?

[Hittman]
Coming and stomping, it's Hitt from Bronson
In collaboration with Dre from Compton
Uhh.. I came to say a little something (Hittman)
What? (2000) Hittman at the service
Highly intensive tongue talents making all nervous
Y'all faking, a four nine with my rhymes on purpose
Y'all hating, puffing with Dre, y'all nervous
Y'all waiting, anticipating, my arrival's California survivalist
Smash on any man rival this
Blast on any one who don't ride with Hitt
Y'all better buy my shit.. (*Toilet Flushed*)

[Dr. Dre]
Hittman, 2000
