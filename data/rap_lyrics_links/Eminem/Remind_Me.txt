Yo...
I bust in, devilish grin, disgusting
Asshole, freckled cheeks and a butt chin
{*kcht*} Callin all party animals
Get on the floor when I pop up on some Whac-A-Mole shit
In search of a chick who's stacked and so thick
And implants are so big
She can hang me up on that rack, big ol' tits like Anna Nicole Smith
Body's bananas and sass to go with
I spot you at first glance and go "Shit!"
You're wearin those pants that don't fit
That butt won't ever give up, that's why you stick it out no matter what
Cause you got an ass that won't quit
So, get on the horn, my saxophone
Grab hold of my instrument, get a grasp and blow
You just laugh and go - "Heehee"
Cause you're just as nasty so, that's appropriate
That's why

[Chorus: Eminem] + {*sample of Joan Jett & The Blackhearts*}
I love YOU, cause you remind me of {"Me"}
That's why I love YOU, cause you're like me {"Yeah, me"}
I said I love YOU, cause you remind me of {"Me"}
That's why I love YOU, cause you're like me, nasty {"Yeah, me"}

[Interlude: Eminem]
You know, I'm wearin a new shirt tonight too (yo)
With me on it

[Eminem]
I'm lookin at your tight rear like a sightseer
Your booty is heavy duty, like diarrhea
The plan's to bring you to my house
You're drinkin Jack and Beam, I'm thinkin soon as trampoline so we should bounce
But you're out of your tube-top
If you're thinkin that mi casa es su casa
Yeah you're a cute fox, perfect ten so, back that up like a moonwalk
Girl you're smokin, like Snoop Dogg
But you must be tokin/token, if you think you're takin over my quarters
There goes a dime into the jukebox {*crash*}
Two shots of blue Hpnotiq and soon I'll
turn this pool hall to a barroom brawl
So Rick, scratch on the break, like the cue ball
Turn the volume all the way up on your boombox
And excuse the locker room talk, I'm just too raw
But apparently, so are you, ma
Cause you just kicked me in the balls and told me to screw off
And that's why

[Chorus]

{"Said-said can I take you home, where we can be alone?"}

[Eminem
Shorty you the shit, girl I order you to sit
I know you're probably feelin me, more than you admit
Pull up a chair sweetie, let me order you a drink
I only go to meetings court-ordered from a shrink
So from the bottom to the top, floor to ceiling
You ain't run-of-the-mill, you're one in a million
Cause real tits are still fun
But everybody knows fake tits are still better than real ones...
So come and spend the night with the guy most are terrified of
But tonight, curiosity overrides ya
Besides, you're fired up
like a starter pistol, crystal and slide hun, tonight I'm your pilot
Cause you should be up in the sky, girl
You're so fuckin fly, you belong in the mile high club
So c'mon baby, the night's young
Don't string me along, I'm high-strung
We might wind up, unbound like we're tryin for the Cy Young
Fuckin 'fore we get to the house, screwin our brains out
Like changin a lightbulb, that's why I like ya
Cause I'm crazy just like ya
Now every time I get brain you screw mine up
I barely can think straight, your head game is a mindfuck
So ready, set, aim and fire
Yes babe, I'm fallin in likeness kinda, why I love

[Chorus]
