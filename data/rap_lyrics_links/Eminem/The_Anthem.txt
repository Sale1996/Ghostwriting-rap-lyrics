-RZA intro from "Airwaves"-

[King Tech]
One two, one two
We dedicate this one to the hip-hop culture y'all
Brought to you by the WOOORRRLLD FAMOUS Wake Up Show

[RZA]
Bobby Steels, Staple' tails, MC's get your lips stapled
Project Killa Hill is stamped on the map like the compass
Sacred sword play tongue twist piercin holes in you 
You can't escape seventy-thousand kilowatts blast through yo' box
Walk wit alarm clocks, cars drivin slow down the block
One stopped, parks, pops his trunk
Snare pops loud as glock shots
Bass like an M-80 in ya face, cops stop, give us citation
We pause for radio station identification
WAKE UP WAKE UP WAKE UP! (Tech is on)

[Tech N9NE]
When I Woke Up, I grabbed the mic and never choked up
Busted a verse and all the G's in Cali loc'ed up when I was summoned
Styles were mixed like the Drummonds
Killer clown is comin lookin around your town is crumblin
This Big Tech from the Midwest, leavin MC's litless
On the Wake Up Show, make up no, stories about my shake-up flow
Put me off in a cypher? Potna, you can't *fuck* wit the snyper
Your flow's premature, clean your dirty diaper
Mic heister, psycho alpha-schizo
Hypno, chryo gat flow, guru and ain't nobody tighter
Sway & Tech heard me flow and it's sealed
Now I got Swedish women yellin "Tech N9NE svelte!"

[Eminem]
This place is my house, I might as well erase my face wit white out
Cuz y'all can't see me like Mase's eyebrows (where you at?)
Climbed out of a nice house
Through the front window and heard this guy shout
"Hey that's my couch! (bitch!)"
Pull a nine out during a rhyme bout
While I'm rippin this shit, put a clip in it spit five rounds
And murder you hoes worse than a convertible flippin verticle
nose-first wit the top off landin up-side down
You're tied down and duct-taped, fuck rape
I'd rather just hump a slut's leg wit my nuts shaved
And Sway & Tech, two disk jockeys
Breakin so many friggin needles I wonder if they inject

[Xzibit]
Lo and behold, better than platinum and gold
Yes God bless success, never forsake your soul
Xzibit take control, lock loaded and ready to roll
Play the upper hand, a man that's never gon' fold
Cuz your tape sucks, find a new hobby that you can take up
Or listen to my niggas Tech & Sway so you can Wake Up
The X-Man, catch me doin drills in the Danger Room
Big game huntin from high noon till the full moon

[Pharoahe Monch]
Wit synonyms, I get an adrenaline rush
From minimum thrusts, bust multiple assaults in small interims
As horrid as Boris Korloff was
When I cut ya neck, leave a little piece of skin so the head won't fall off
Hauled-off, sawed off shotgun blast
He asked, why did he have to die like cast metal?
O, huh, C now like Omar Credle
We pone pedal at a high resolution 
On the Wake Up Show wit Sway, Tech and DJ Revolution

*DJ Revolution scratches*

[Kool G Rap]
I sway the tec wit the Tech and Sway
Step away, wet and spray, rep the day
Who over debt to pay get swept away
Across the whole board like checker play
When I blaze your whole sect' arrays
Wake Up Show for those who slept away
Niggas that met the trey, hit the deck and pray
DJ Revolution, spinnin like lead from out the head decay
Tearin your neck away, flood up the street wit blood redecorate
Until the head of jake investigate

[Jayo Felony]
What, Sway can give it to but Whatcha Gon' Do wit it
Tech  can give it to you but Whatcha Gon' Do?
Rev can give it to you but Whatcha Gon' Do wit it
I can give it to you, Wha Wha Wha What What!

[Chino XL]
Yo yo, Chino make the world go 'round
Fuckin up entire record companies like Harrell did to Motown
Vominous talk, poison pen, hominous walk
Which flow will I destroy you wit this time, the most commonest thought
The drama that's brought, caught us in the midst of a sibling rivalry
For instance, there is nothing born in existence that can survive wit me
Clone me like sheep, I clean house like Tony Randall
My style foul/file, for sexual harrassment like Tisha Campbell
You wack like Will Smith, your rhyme style is pansy
I fuckin murder your young style like Jon Benet Ramsey
Now who the master to beg, your demo get passed on the reg'
You shouldn't have been signed if you had a white cast on your leg
I'm Wake Up Show reppin, wit Sway & Tech
My tec's like Tekken, the industry weapon
I'm Chino X, bring KRS in

[KRS-One]
De de de da de de de da di day HEY! KRS-One comin wit the Tech & Sway
Yo, I rock up on the littlest set and up on the biggest set
As ill as it gets I still manage to wiggle your neck wit sweat
Never forget, the bigger the budget the bigger the debt
You gotta be, willin to rock in the middle of dry and in the middle of wet
But I'm willin to bet, on a Sway and a Tech
They stay in effect, never been a pain in the neck, they gainin respect
Nevertheless I WRECK YOU, now you know what Sway and Tech do
I'll be back but for now just SACKLE!!!
Ha ha ha, FRESH for 1999 you SUCKAS!!!
