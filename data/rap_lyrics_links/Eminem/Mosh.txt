[Intro: little children]
I pledge allegiance, to the flag, of the United States of America..
{*warplane flies overhead*}
And to the republic, for which it stands..
[Eminem] People!
.. one nation, under God, indivisible..
[Eminem] It feels so good to be back!
.. with liberty and justice for all
[Eminem] Mosh with me now

[Verse 1]
You scrutinize every word, memorize every line
I spit it once, refuel, re-energize, and rewind
I give sight to the blind, my insight tthrough the mind
I exercize my right to express when I feel it's time
It's just all in your mind, what you interpret it as
I say to fight and you take it as "I'ma whip someone's ass"
If you don't understand don't even bother to ask
A father who has, grown up with a fatherless - past
Who has blown up now, to rap phenomenon that has
or at least shows no difficulty multi-taskin
And juggling both, perhaps mastered his craft slash
entrepreneur, who's helped launch a few more rap acts
Whose has had a few obstacles thrown his way through the last half
of his career typical manure movin past that
Mr. Kiss-His-Ass-Crack, he's a class act
Rubberband man yeah, he just snaps back

[Chorus]
Come along, follow me, as I lead through the darkness
As I provide just enough spark that we need
to procede, carry on, give me hope
Give me strength, come with me, and I won't steer you wrong 
Put your faith, and your trust, as I guide us through the fog
To the light, at the end, of the tunnel we gon' fight
We gon' charge, we gon' stomp, we gon' march through the swamp
We gon' mosh through the marsh, take us right through the doors
C'mon

[Verse 2]
All the people up top, on the side and the middle
Come together let's all form, and swarm just a little
Just let it gradually build, from the front to the back
All you can see is a sea of people some white and some black 
Don't matter what color all that metters we're gathered together
to celebrate for the same cause no matter the weather
If it rains, let it rain, yeah the wetter the better
They ain't gon' stop us they can't, we're stronger now more than ever
They tell us no we say yeah, they tell us stop we say go
Rebel with a rebel yell, raise hell, we gon' let 'em know
Stomp, push shove, mush, fuck Bush
Until they bring our troops home c'mon, just

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Imagine it pourin, just rainin down on us
Mosh pits outside the Oval Office, someone's tryin
to tell us somethin maybe this is God just
saying we're responsible, for this monster
This coward that we have empowered, this is Bin Laden
Look at his head noddin - how could, we allow 
somethin like this without, pumpin our fist now
this is our, final hour..
Let me, be the voice, and your strength, and your choice
Let me simplify the rhyme just to emplify the noise
Try to amplify it, times-it, and multiply it by six-teen
million people all equal at this high pitch
Maybe we can reach Al'Qaeda through my speech
Let the President answer a higher anarchy 
Strap him with an AK-47, let him go
fight his own war, let him impress daddy that way
No more blood for oil, we got our own battles
to fight on our own soil, no more psychological warfare
to trick us to thinkin we ain't loyal
If we don't serve our own country we're patronizin a hero
Look in his eyes it's all lies
The stars and stripes have been swiped, washed out and wiped
and replaced with his own face, mosh now or die
If I get sniped tonight, you'll know why - cause I told you to fight!

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
And as we procede, to mosh through this Desert Storm
And these closing statements, if they should argue
Let us beg to differ
As we set aside our differences, and assemble our own army
To disarm, THIS weapon of mass destruction
that we call our President, for the present
And mosh for the future of our next generation
To speak, and be heard
Mr. President!  Mr. Senator!

You guys hear us? {*laughing*}
