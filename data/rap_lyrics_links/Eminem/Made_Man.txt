[Intro: Royce Da 5'9"]
What if I told you this my nigga
You could sell your tape without takin no L or loss
You can date chicks like Janelle Monae and Tracee Ellis Ross
You can make it

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Uh, but if you flagrant when you walk over answers
Your chance slimmer than Karen Civil in Fashion Nova pants is
What's worse than bein one of those sayin, "We were those"
I'm tryna drink Cuervo
Inside of Philippe Chow while being elite, with a freak with a body like Bernice Burgos
(Y'all know what I'm talkin 'bout) I think you niggaz see where I'm tryna go
I been around since Moschino and I seen palm trees
The D-Town don who will spring for them cream Don C's
I don't know Hypebeast though, I'm a mic beast bro
I don't recite these flows, I homicide these hoes
I got the leg of your baby mama and fiancée tremblin
Show up, kill it then disappear, like André Benjamin
That's cause I straight swim in them, Aston Mart' base bendin them
Basketball play spinnin them, massive heartbreak, minimum
Y'all are woke, cause it's all a hoax (they tell us lies)
I went from eatin oatmeal in the mess hall to doin dope deals to Hall & Oates

[Denaun Porter]
I said I've seen all the lots of evil men'll do (men'll do)
Shit, I mean I did a thing or two (yessir)
Can't nobody tell me how to wear my shoes
Plus they too big for you to use, you lose, you lose

[Chorus: Denaun Porter]
Ain't much no one can say 'bout me, I done made my way
Took my losses, it's safe to say
That I'm a made man, a made man
A made man, a made man
Ain't shit y'all can say 'bout me, I done made my way
Took my losses, it's safe to say
That I'm a made man, a made man
I'm a made man, a made man

[Big K.R.I.T.]
Yeah, Krizzle; this here was God-given
I'm the design of a black man, I defined by hard livin
But how I whip that old school slowly out the gutter
past them haters and bitches that wouldn't fuck with me
Sometimes bein a ugly duckling mean that you'll grow up to be
the player of the ball in, Louis slippers, had to do 'em
My bucket list was livin good and goin to Hell and I'm halfway through it
Slide me a chick on the side cause I don't halfway do it
I made the kinda moves that paved the way and got me provin
I'm made, man

[Denaun Porter]
I've seen a lot of evil things that men'll do (men'll do)
Shit, I mean I did a thing or two (yessir)
Y'all can't tell me how to wear my shoes
Plus they too big for you to use, you lose, you lose

[Chorus]

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Fresh out the belly of the beast with my niggaz
We live by the gun and we die by the trigger
You never seen me digress, even when I had different problems
Everything's a work in progress, even my bitches' bodies
Niggaz in the streets aim terribly with that full clip
Turn into marksmen when it's time to miss me with that bullshit
My new religion, that bottle not a thang to me
I'm tired of you niggaz like I'm tired of watchin them slave movies

[Denaun Porter]
I've seen lots of evil things that men'll do (men'll do)
Shit, I mean I did a thing or two (yessir)
Y'all can't tell me how to wear my shoes
Plus they too big for you to use, you lose, you lose

[Chorus]

[Outro: Denaun Porter]
Yeah, yeah
