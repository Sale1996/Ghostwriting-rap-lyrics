[Intro: Eminem]
{"Tay Keith, fuck these niggaz up!"}
Yeah...

[Interlude: Eminem]
Brain dead, eye drops, pain meds, cyclops
Daybed, iPod, Maybach, my bach
Train wrecks, sidewalks, Payless, high-tops
K-Fed, iHop, Playtex, icebox

[Chorus: Eminem]
That's how much we have in common (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (whoa!)
Up on this mic when we're on it (yeah!)
That's how much we have in common (yea!)
That's how much we have in common (whoa!)
That's how much we have in common
We are not alike, there's not alike us

[Eminem]
On the mic (yeah!)

[Royce Da 5'9"]
I don't do Jordans and Audemars, I do explosions and Molotovs
Y'all blowin smoke as if y'all ain't washed, I blow the smoke from the car exhaust
Flyin to a party I am not invited to feelin like the streets need me
I ain't gotta dance long as my Ferrari Spyder move, like C-Breezy
I don't gotta hire goons, I'd rather try to buy the moon, and breathe freely
The sky is blue, the tie is new, the Masarati white and cool, like G-Eazy
While these dudes tryna figure out how to do a freestyle as fly as me
I'm confused tryna figure out how to do Kapri Styles and Mya G
Everybody doin chick joints, probably rob these little dudes at fist-point
'Member everybody used to bite Nickel, now everybody doin Bitcoin
We don't got nothin in common (no) we don't got nothin in common (no)
Y'all into stuff like doubled-up Styrofoam cups on them uppers-and-downers (woo!)
I'm into stuff like doublin commas, find me a brother who's solid
To count the shit up and then bust the shit down, when the cops set us up we can flush the shit down
We can not give a fuck shit, a fuckin colonic, sellin your cock and your butt for a follower
Possible couple of dollars, you powder sniff, now you're slippin, call it a power trip, a product of politics
Y'all went from profit and toppin the charts to dropped in the park in a pile of shit
Knowledge is power, but powerless if you got it and you do not acknowledge it
Y'all music sound like Dr. Seuss inspired it, hirin strippers, prostitute retirin
We could spit it for ya advance, I'm fit to be king, you're cut out to fit in Prince pants
You niggaz

[Interlude]

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
You say you're affiliated with murderers, killas (ayy) the people you run with are thuggin (gang)
But you're just a wannabe Gunner (gang) like you was gonna do somethin
Actin like you catchin bodies (ayy) and you got juice lil' youngin, you're buggin
You ain't never even been charged in connection with battery, bitch you ain't plugged into nothin
Rap God spit lyrical bullets (pyoon) and gats cock, your partners better tool up
This has not to do with muscular, but have guns for sure, you better put a
strap on, other words if you're gonna, roll up with your (gang) you're gon' need a arsenal
Cause this bar is over your head, so you better, have arms if you're gonna pull up (skrrt)
Oh, you run the streets, huh? Now you wanna come and fuck with me, huh?
This little cock-sucker, he must be feelin himself, he wants to keep up
his tough demeanor so he does a feature, decides to team up with Nina
But next time you don't gotta use Tech N9ne if you wanna come at me with a sub, Machine Gun
And I'm talkin to you, but you already know who the fuck you are, Kelly
I don't use sublims, and sure as fuck don't sneak-diss, but keep commenting
on my daughter Hailie, I keep on tellin motherfuckers but just in case you forgot really
And need y'all memories jarred like strawberry or pineapple, apricot jelly
I respond rarely but this time Shady 'bout to sound off like a fuckin cocked semi Glock, demi-god
Let me put a fuckin silencer on this little non-threatening blonde fairy cornball takin shots at me
You're not ready fool, break yourself like Rock Steady Crew, obviously I'm not getting
through, we can get it poppin like Redenbach', letting off like Remy Ma, heavy artille-
-ry, Godzilla harsh with a hard shell, but a motherfuckin heart bigger than Bizarre's belly
Only time you'll ever say I/eye lost, you'll be talkin 'bout Fetty Wap, better call Diddy
Just to try to get me off, and you better hope I don't call Trick Trick
Bitch this shit don't fly in our city; punk, you don't disrespect O.G.'s, R.I.P. Prodigy
Sold Dre my soul and then told him the moment he signed me that I'll be the most hated, though
Made it so that there's no shame, it's OK to own it cause life is a bitch, she's a bow-legged hoe
But now those days are over, I Harvey Weinstein a bathrobe hangin open
My code name is Groper, I role-play with lotion, I fuck the whole world then I throw away the Trojan
Ol√© the hoes like with home-made explosives, I blow eighty holes in you
Don't make me go in, I O.J. the flows and I'm insult to injury, Rolaids to Goldman
I'm Ghost, Rae and Motrin, I throated Nicole as they both there to choke and my whole plate is soakin
I double-edge sword it cause one place I poke and I stick and I turn in a rotatin motion
... Invisible with the pen, I'm at the pinnacle of sick individuals
Stick my dick and put the tip in at minimal, I'm fuckin these syllables, I let 'em lick on my genitals
I'm a fuckin invincible, indefensible, despicable, difficult prick, a little bit unpredictable
I spit the formidable that you bitches fuckin with, the original, I consider me and Nickel identical
But not us, the only thing we have in common's I'm a dick and you suck
Otherwise one has nuttin to do with the other, none come close to skunk, bug, soldier
Tongue, shrub, shoulder, one month older, sponge, mug holder, none, rug, holster
Lug nut, coaster, lung, jug roaster, Young Thug poster, unplugged toaster!

[Chorus]

[Outro: Eminem]
Man, fuck this shit, let's go
