[Intro: Eminem]
Aiyyo, this next song, is a true story
(Come here, bitch!)
Cause some things in this universe
Don't make sense but some-how, always seem to fuckin work

[Eminem]
Flyin down I-75 'bout to hop on 696
I look over this fuckin chick's tryin to fix 
her make-up, I'm like bitch - you ain't a plastic surgeon
I advise ya to put up your visor, I'm gettin kinda ticked
You're blockin my side mirror, she's like "Yeah, so?"
I'm like, sew? You gon' need a stitch you keep actin like that, hoe
I look like your husband, slut?
That's a rhetorical question, you talk to me like you talk to him I'll fuck you up!
In fact, get in the back seat
like the rest of my dates, no bitch rides shotgun, what? Taxi
Stop and pick you some Maxi pads up, is that what you actually asked me?
{*smack*} Bitch reaches over and smacks me
Says I annoy the FUCK out her, get the fuckin back, put on your slut powder
You slut, what? And shut the fuck up now or
get your feelings hurt worse than my last chick when I accidentally butt-dialed her 
and she heard me spreadin AIDS rumors about her
Turn the radio up louder, make it thump
while I bump that "Relapse" CD tryin to hit every bump
And that cunt thought I snapped back into ac-cents
Cause she kept askin me to quit callin her cunt, I said "I CUN'T!"

[Chorus: Eminem]
She said, Marshall you ain't really like that
Ohh-ohh-ohhh, you're puttin on a show, where's your mic at?
Cause you're breaking my hearrrrrt
She said, you're breaking my hearrrrrt
Cause, cause you ain't really like that
Ohh-ohh-ohhh, you're puttin on a show, where's your mic at?
Cause you're breaking my hearrrrrt
She said, you're breaking my hearrrrrt

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Uh, pull up to the club in a Porsche, not a Pinto
While Marshall's at a +White Trash Party+, I'm at drama central
I walk up in there lookin at my phone on Twitter tweetin
I'm feelin a bunch of bitches lookin at a nigga cheesin
I get approached by this little skeezer
She asked me am I the realest G cause I'm Gucci from head to feet and
I said, "Yeah, I'm really is
Cause I'll spit in your man's face like Cam did that little kid on +Killa Season+"
She said, "I'm feelin your big +Ego+, wait, am I talkin wrong?"
I said, "Nah, I'm a walkin Kanye/Beyonc√© song"
She said, "I'm mad at you" - I said "Why?"
She said, "Why you never make songs for chicks as if it's hard to do?"
I said "I'll make songs for me, leave the studio
and go and FUCK the bitch who belong to who makin songs for you"
She said, "I'm feelin your whole swagger and flow
Can we hook up?" I said, "Mmm, you just used the word 'swagger' so NO~!"
She said

[Chorus: Eminem]
You ain't really like that
Ohh-ohh-ohhh, you're puttin on a show, where's your mic at?
Cause you're breaking my hearrrrrt
She said, you're breaking my hearrrrrt
Cause, cause you ain't really like that
Ohh-ohh-ohhh, you're puttin on a show, where's your mic at?
Cause you're breaking my hearrrrrt
She said, you're breaking my hearrrrrt

[Eminem]
We've been ridin around in this hatchback 'til I'm fuckin hunchback
Where the fuck's this party at slut bag cunt? Cut what act?
Think it's an act? Fuck that, I'm tryin to shag scuzz, better find this love shack
or somewhere to fuck at; ah, don't touch that
You fat dyke, I'm tryin to hear some +Bagpipes 
From Baghdad+, don't act like you don't like 'em, them accents I rap tight
And I'ma torture you 'til we find this place, yeah that's right
Thought it was just past this light, just past Van Dyke
Better hit that map light - read them directions, oh yeah
You can't read, and you can't write, told me that last night
She took my CD out the deck, snapped it in half like {*snap*}
"Relapse" sucked, I snapped, hit the gas like {*vroom*}
Blew through the light, spun out, hit a patch of black ice
Forgot we had a trailer hitched to the back, we jackknifed
Bitch flew out the car, I laughed like she deserved it
She didn't think I'd act like that in person

[Royce Da 5'9"] + (Eminem)
(Royce, Marshall just crashed right in front of the club!)
Tell him I'll be there in a minute
I'm tryin to break up this catfight between my mistress and damn wife
Then a chick wanted a hug, she was fat
So I gave her dap, then I tell her to scat
I'm not mean, I'm cute; on my way to the front door takin the scenic route
to avoid this chick with a lace front lookin like Venus's and Serena's hooves
I'm just sayin, them chicks got horse asses, they been attractive
Hope when they see me they don't slap me with they tennis rackets
My mind drifted, back to this shit
I see my wife push her down, step over her body, then smack the mistress
Police outside, I turn and pass the gat to Vishis
then I step out and see my Evil twin; he gives me an evil grin
He mugs the mistress, turns around and gives the misses hugs and kisses
Looks at me twisted, like Nickel (yeah, watch this shit!)
He smacks the dentures outta the mouth of the fat bitch he rolled with
and looks back to mention (Royce, it's good to be back to business)
They said

[Chorus: Eminem]
You ain't really like that
Ohh-ohh-ohhh, you're puttin on a show, where's your mic at?
Cause you're breaking our hearrrrrts
They said, you're breaking our hearrrrrts
Cause, cause you ain't really like that
Ohh-ohh-ohhh, you're puttin on a show, where's your mic at?
Cause you're breaking our hearrrrrts
They said, you're breaking our hearrrrrts
