[Skylar Grey]
I'm stumbling, I can't see straight
And it's my fault, I got this way
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to mess it all up
I did my best, I tried to change
But it's just in my DNA
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to fuck it up again

[Interlude: Skylar Grey]
Now I'm the one, thing
You couldn't hate, more
But you're the one, thing
That I would die forrrrr!

[Eminem]
All my life I was told, I was never nothin special
I don't need to be reminded of it every other second
'Specially when all my self-esteem's already shot to hell, I'm fallin helplessly
I'm embarrased, I don't want no one else to see
Cause I feel like I'm a piece of shit every time she yells at me
Selfishly addicted, definitely doesn't help that she
makes me feel like I've died and gone to heaven but makes life a livin hell for me
She does that thing with her lip, now she's meltin me
I'm putty in her palms, I'm wrapped around her finger
A yo-yo on a string, she lets me sit there and just dangle
until somethin better comes along and she'll just drop me like a hot potato
I look like I'm in pain, but I'm okay though
Cause I know she loves me Â— my friends, what do they know?

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hopin that you reach for me
I know you're there but I can't see
Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
Drunk off tragic endings

[Eminem]
In my moments of weakness I openly admit the shit I wouldn't normally
I'm extremely self-conscious and enormously
insecure and she uses it to torture when she torments me
It only turns to ammunition for her, in this war when she
gets goin she don't stop, when I'm up she's like a downer
When I found her it was love at first encounter
Plus somehow she musta took the carton of eggs off the counter
Cracked 'em and placed all the shells on the ground for me to walk on when I'm around her
But there's just somethin 'bout her that makes me not able to function without her
How can I get out of it when I don't know how to?
I'm a doubter, I'm a pessimist, make a believer out of me
And show me the way now or stay the fuck out of my cloud of rain
Cause I'm goin straight down the drain, I'm drownin

[Chorus]

[Interlude]

[Eminem]
It took a while for me to get it but I think I've figured it out
She don't want me, she just don't wanna see me with someone else
The idea of seein me happy destroys her in itself
To see me fallin to pieces brings her joy, it brings her hell
But it annoys her to see me get this strict and say screw her
I threw up on myself, I'm dumb sick, I'm addicted to her
She's tryna block the door, so here's how I'll do her
Since I'm manure, she's a sewer, this time this piece of shit's runnin through her
I can see the light, now I'm runnin to it, what the fuck? Shoulda knew it
Who would think she'd actually have the balls to do it?
As soon as I hopped in it she doused the car with lighter fluid
She's standin there with a rag, 'bout to put the lighter to it
Lit the fuckin thing on fire then she threw it {*boom*}

[Chorus]
