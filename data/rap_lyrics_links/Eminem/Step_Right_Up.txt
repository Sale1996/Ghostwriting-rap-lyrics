Step right up
I'm about to light up the skyline so bright i'ma fuck your whole night up
Fuck ya glow sticks, and go stick a stick in ya ass
This is the ghost of christmas past
This is ya ho, she's supposed to kiss his ass
This is gross but listen close
If you don't you can go stick ya whole frickin' nose against his crack
'till he lets one go and blows ya whiskers back
and get a great big 'ol whiff cuz if you last
without passing out you'll be on the next episode of fear factor
Ya, i'm back to... back to what? I dont know, smack a little child actor's butt
Mike Jackson, what? What the fuck you want? I got a blunt 
and some jesus juice, who needs an excuse these days
the way they rally around pedophiles your lucky I don't pee in your face
I can do anything and apologize for it later, 
as long as it aint a racist tape from '88, than i'm straight-a
That cannot be forgave 
If I drank pee for, eighteen years straight
And ate shit every day on a porcelain plate
that was shaped like a toilet with a fork and steak
knife, for the rest of my life
and had to watch my ex-wife get fucked by vanilla ice
twice a day, cuz I said N-I-G-G-A, when I was a teenager
Blaow, blaow Shade-a
forty-five, shorty let me get your number baby 
maybe I can hump your leg or
something, but its time for me to go
so I stopped, jumped in the vehicle
its like this, because of that boob right?!
