[Intro: Eminem]
You know
Everybody's been tellin me what they think about me for the last few months
Maybe it's time I tell 'em what I think about them

[Interlude: Justin Vernon]
It's too loud
Can't hear it comin down the hallway stairs, from the parking lot
It's too loud
Freeze my crown all up in it, slow fire

[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
Don't fall on my face
Don't follow my faith, ohh
Don't fall on my fate
Don't follow my faith, ohh
Don't fall on my fate

[Justin Vernon]
Don't fall on my

[Eminem]
Gotta concentrate, against the clock I race
Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace
Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre
and that first marijuana tape, guess I got a +Chronic+ case
And I ain't just blowin smoke, 'less it's in your momma's face
I know this time Paul and Dre, they won't tell me what not to say
And though me and my party days have all pretty much parted ways
You'd swear to God I forgot I'm the guy that made "Not Afraid"
One last time for Charlamagne, if my response is late
It's just how long it takes to hit my fuckin radar, I'm so far away
These rappers are like "Hunger Games", one minute they're +Mocking-Jay+
Next minute they get their style from Migos, 'til they copy Drake
Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away
But all the hate, I call it "Walk on Water"-gate, I've had as much as I can tolerate
I'm sick and tired of waitin, I done lost my patience
I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once, you wanted Shady?
You got it!

[Chorus]

[Eminem over Chorus]
Yeah
Line 'em up!
Brrat! Ha

[Eminem]
Somebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it
Or have his body bag get zipped, the closest thing he's had to hits is smackin bitches
And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks
Say this shit is trash again I'll have you twisted
like you had it when you thought you had me slippin
at the telly, even when I'm gettin brain you'll never catch me with a THOT, lacking with it
"He ain't spittin like this on his last shit!" Hoe you better go back and listen
You know me better, thinkin I'll slow or let up, call it trap cause it's a
total setup hopin that you rappers fall in that
Dre said, "Hold your head up!" Kathy Griffin
Stackin ammunition, slap the clip and cock it back on competition
This is how I shot ahead (pew) Gabby Giffords
My attack is vicious, Jack the Ripper, back in business
Tyler +Create+ nothin, I see why you called yourself a [faggot] bitch
It's not just cause you lack attention
It's because you worship D12's balls, you're sack-religious
If you're gonna critique me, you better at least be as good or better
Get Earl the Hooded Sweater, whatever his name is to help you put together
some words, more than just two letters
The fans waited for this moment like that feature when I stole the show (ha)
Sorry if I took +Forever+ (haha)

[Chorus]

[Eminem over Chorus]
Yeah, I won't
Line 'em up!
Ha... it's too easy

[Eminem]
Just remember, I was here before you
And I'll be here after you, make your run-in for you
Detractors, I might have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew
Just what the doctor ordered; revenge is the best medicine, increase the dose
from least to most and then tell the Grammys to go
and fuck themselves, they suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches so
they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to 'em, see the show
Every parasite needs a host (haha)
Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of
All I know is I wrote every single word of everything I ever murdered
Time to separate the sheep from goats (yeah)
And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts
When rap needed it most, I was that wing and the prayer
A beacon of hope, put a B-I-R-D in the air
Somewhere some kid is bumpin this while he lip-syncs in the mirror
That's who I'm doin it for, the rest I don't really even care
But you would think I'm carryin an Oxford dictionary in my pocket
how I'm buryin these artists, on the scale it turns to minus
Mines is various as hardly and what's scary is you probably
can compare me to your car cause I'm just barely gettin started
And far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the hell alone
Or I'll show you an Elvis clone
Walk up in this house you own, thrust my pelvic bone, use your telephone
and go fetch me the remote, put my feet up and just make myself at home
I belong here, clown, don't tell me 'bout the culture
I inspire the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, the
Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9"s, and oh
Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat, piss and moan
But I'm not gonna fall, bitch! (yeah)
