[Kon Artis]
Well its friday afternoon and I just woke up (*burp-fart*)
That's right I just woke up
From an excruciating evening at work, woman so what
That its two-thirty-PM, I'm grown dammit straight up
And know when through my finger either I think it is time we bust, you know
Leave the premisis less you plannin' to cook, I mean it's
Three o'clock and I gotta gimme a cut for that
Big party tonight thrown at K-P Productions
And I don't wanna loose my spot
Cuz everybody know "Big O" got the tightest fans on the block
So I got to be in that seat at Four o'clock
Shoot I need me some crispy-ones to go with my new outfit
So tell ya people.

[Chorus: Kon Artis]
Tell ya people, that I'm the man
I can't be faded, there's been a change of plans
You can meet me at the barbershop (At the barbershop)
At the barbershop (At the barbershop)
You can meet me at the barbershop (C'mon, where?)
At the barbershop (At the barbershop)

[Kuniva]
Haha
Understand me now, I'm cool as a breeze (Wassup playa, wassup)
On the black hand side, gimme some grease (Alright)
I want a liner but naw I don't want you to fate me (Nope)
A ghetto girl with a attitude to contegrate me
So what's happenin', the hood's seein' in
I get the scoop on everyone in the ghetto so let's begin
Who got shot? (Mike)
Who got jumped? (Eric)
Who got ganked? (Shay)
Who got robbed? (Dee)
Who went to jail? (Chuck)
Who got saved? (Rick)
Who's gettin' money and who's broke as a joke
And hear about your lady called me that started smokin' that dope (For
real?)
You get it all at this little dusty place
Let me be still, she gettin' out the razor from my face
You see.

[Chorus: Kon Artis]
Tell ya people, that I'm the man
I can't be faded, there's been a change of plans
You can meet me at the barbershop (At the barbershop)
At the barbershop (At the barbershop)
You can meet me at the barbershop (C'mon, where?)
At the barbershop (At the barbershop)

[Bizarre]
You heard of me, the fat guy that raps
Now its time for Bizarre to take off his shower cap
Its been five days, I patiently waited
Saturday morning, its time to get faded
And I mean get faded, "I mean get faded"
Damn at four o'clock, I didn't almost make it
My barber's name is Sarah, she don't really know how to cut
But she gots nice teeth and big ol' butt
So two days a week, I get faded for no reason
Same ol' haircut, keep it low and breathin'
If you see me in a barbershop, go on and run
Cuz I'm probably gettin' a perm and my toe-nails done

[Proof + (Kon Artis)]
Got here full grip, but can't call the cops
I gotta get the script from the lips to the barbershop
Jump in the seat "Yo gimme the line and"
And tell me who came through shinnin'
(Homeboy scooped up, in a new truck)
(Gave everybody a cup and gave me a few bucks)
(Then he started braggin' bout his last lick)
Cut me a design along with his address

[Swift]
You can have a million dollar suit on, shinnin' with ya karats up
But it don't mean nothin' if ya floggin' in ya haircut
Now who next? (Um I just want my son to get a tech)
Whatabout you sweetie? (So what you tryin' say?)
I'm just playin' with you baby (Hey He do this all the time)
And all you do is whine, and drink wine (Hahaha)
Yo' you know that Cho-chie got knocked out (Man) (When?)
Early at Le'mott's house (Again?)
(I wouldn't let that man sit on my couch)
(You was wit him yesterday)
(Man what are you talkin' bout?)
I'm just about ready to throw y'all out
(No you ain't, I'll be here for bout a hour)
No I'll raise up the rates

[Kon Artis]
So go tell ya people, that I'm the man
I can't be faded, there's been a change of plans
You can meet me at the barbershop (At the barbershop)
You can meet me at the barbershop (At the barbershop)
You can meet me at the barbershop (C'mon, where?)
At the barbershop (At the barbershop)
