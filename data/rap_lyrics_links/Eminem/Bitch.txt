[D12]
We got something for the bitches!!!

[Intro - Eminem]
Aha, these bitches always be all... giggling and shit (come on BITCH)
but they get mad when their favorite song don't come on in the club (get em')
catch an attitude and shit (come on BITCH, come on BITCH)
so we got one for them, it goes like this (BITCH, BITCH, BITCH, BITCH)

[Eminem]
We wrote a song for the hoes
You like to hear it, here it goes
A little somethin you probably won't hear on your radios
So when it comes on in the club it's one that everyone knows
And if I'm talking to fast it just means you're listening to slow
And if you listen a little faster maybe you'll catch up, BITCH
Ju jah jah jah dah du ju jah 
You just made me mess up, BITCH
Blibiri babiler blabber
It don't matter, I'm just blabbering 
Like you understand what I'm saying Anyway
I'm just traveling in one ear and I'm out the other
You're so fuckin drunk all you hear is the Beat and the beat
I could be sayin anything, just get ya ass on the floor
Wear the same pants that you wore from the day before
Baby and shake that ass like a whore

[Chorus - Eminem and Kon Artis]
Yeah I'm talkin to you BITCH
Get up and dance BITCH
Wiggle that ass BITCH
Yeah that's it bitch
Yeah I called you a BITCH, BITCH
What you going to do about it BITCH
Sit there and cry like a little BITCH, BITCH

Get up and dance BITCH
Wiggle that ass BITCH
You little trash BITCH
Yeah thats it
Yeah I called you a trash BITCH
Not trailer trash SWITCH
Take the person you with and exchange partner BITCH

[Swifty]
tell me that it aint no hangin, and fuck callin home
untill you look at me before you answer the phone
when I flee, your ass can get naked and be as free
as you wanna be freak
but I'm takin the key with me.
you aint gonna get shit, so dont even ask
disrespect my wishes, BITCH, i'll beat your ass
watch me comin home floor eatin half of your doggy bag
and I leave laughin, while you callin me on the rag
I'm the type that might cut off the lights when I hit
and before she cut them on, Kuniva already SWITCHED
your ass aint even ridin with Swift unless you're hoein
when I'm done, I throw you out and ask you where you goin

[Bizarre]
Hoe ain't the only thing you call a girl
Slut, Tramp, (oh, how you doin sir?)
ever since I was eight, I been startin to hate
I said fuck the Hoes, and started eatin cheese cake
scrambled eggs and steak, strawberrys and grapes
damn that sounds great, hold on wait (Bizzy!)
okay, back to the bitches, wash the dishes after that
give me stitches, a fuckin half indian chick, sucked my dick
this time tommorow, I wont remember shit
got respect for a player, got on snoop gators
but they aint now laters bitch.

[Chorus]

blow your tounge and give this one the mouth you came with a condom
quick cum is the motto, so just swallow and breathe, swallow and breathe, now swallow these p's
I know you moca lotti mommies won't get down on your knees

hit the telly fuck her belly you aint gotta go weak
plus you wanna be a model you need a lot of more sleep
I'm a pimp bitch dont be shy, show me them big tits

for instance, busting nuts is only my interest
so princess, don't get your feelings hurt cause men just
party and bullshit till she gargle and swallow the dick
I'm takin the train to spain, don't bother calling me bitch

[Chorus]

[Outro - Kon Artis And Eminem]

dancing, tryin to get a nigga money in the club, with your stupid manipular self
we was talkin bout you dough dough, you, you dumb bitch, YOU!
the one that want a drink and dont want to pay for it
spend all your money you make all week on that dress
and I spill a drink on it, actin like I'm drunk when I'm not

HAHAHAHA, whoo!, D-Twizzy, yeah!, BITCH, BITCH, BITCH
