[Eminem]
Sandy Hook, Stoneman Douglas, another lone-wolf gunman
Sometimes I don't know what this world has come to, it's blowin up and
this whole country is goin nuts and the, NRA is, in our way
They're responsible for this whole production, they hold the strings to control the puppets
... And they threaten to take away donor bucks
So they know the government won't do nothin and no one's budgin, gun owners' clutchin
their loaded weapons, they love their guns more than our children
Shh, think another one just entered in our building
And we'll be

[Kehlani]
Ashes blowin in the air
Our world's on fire, but we don't care, yeah
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin back and we're never gettin old
Cause the skies are black but our heart's made of gold
Fuck doin what you're told
We're goin nowhere fast

[Eminem]
I feel sorry for this beat, sympathy pains for this track
This road is takin me back, down memory lane with this rap
I can still look out in this crowd, be wowed and be taken aback
I'm simply stating a fact, I had Wembley Stadium packed
But now we're on a path headed to nowhere and, fast
Another terrorist, attacks, like a tariff, blows half
of Madison Square up, alas, we perish, in the blast
But that isn't scarin us, we pass knowin we're fearless
Cause we're just

[Chorus: Kehlani] + (Eminem)
Ashes blowin in the air
Our world's on fire, but we don't care (we don't give a) yeah (no)
Wasted youth, always on the road
Never lookin back and we're never gettin old
Cause the skies are black but our heart's made of gold (golden)
Fuck doin what you're told (what we're told)
We're goin nowhere fast

[Eminem]
Fuck doin what you're told, act like a 2-year old
Shit is soon to go kaboom and blow anyways, for MC's it's a funeral
When I'm devisin this rhyme, cause I'm a-wake and you're mourning/morning
That's why I rise and I shine, like a new day has dawned on me
Gusto, guts, bravado
Nuts and plus I kick up dust and cuss a lot, I musta got you in somewhat of a debacle
Cause some stuff that's awful, really don't mean nothin although
There's a lot of, shit I said in-jest, that's tough to swallow
... But if at times my heart it seems
like it's in the wrong place, it's probably cause, it's on my sleeve
Keanu Reeves, +Speed+ of life, avoid or veer or just steer
toward it, we're only lookin forward, but where we're goin, we have no idea
Nowhere to go but hysterical, it's gettin warm in here
I set the world on fire, was born to be an arsonist
Just one spark and it's lit, but I'ma still get dark on this shit
Told you I'd leave my mark on this bitch - War Machine
But you forced me in a corner, I'm sure to, have somethin for your rear
And in the course of the assault as torture, gets more severe
Go to war with me you'll end up blew to Timbuktu, I'll send at you
a 10-ton nuke like Kim Jong-Un and end up ruinin your Korea/career!
But when all is said and done
And at the end of my run I'll just rewind clocks, forever young
Make time stop, will I ever fall off? That day'll never come
To the pine box bitch, fuck you! I'm better than I ever was
'Til the bomb drops, hope it never does but, I'm not gonna sweat it cause
This world's screwed, it's already fucked, and I'm on top, so everyone's just

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Kehlani]
Cause we're goin no, goin no, goin no
Goin no, goin no, goin nowhere
We're on the run of our lives
Goin nowhere fast

[Eminem] + (Kehlani)
You can't, tell us nothin
Hard-headed, and we're stubborn
So, one ear, and out the other
When we're young, we're young, we're young
(On the run of our lives)
Who knows what the future for us could hold?
Another shooter, uh-oh
(On the run of our lives)
No more tomorrows, we're done, we're done
And all we are is

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
