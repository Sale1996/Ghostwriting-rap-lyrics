[Chorus: Jessie Reyez]
You're such a nice guy, a nice guy
You're faithful, you don't lie
After the club, you go back home, right?
Ri-i-ight?! SI-I-IKE!

[Interlude: Jessie Reyez]
Suck my dick, you fuckin suck man
Suck my dick, you fuckin suck man
I hope that your heart get hit by a semi-truck
Suck my dick, you fuckin suck man

[Jessie Reyez]
I hop in your whip and take a sip then I gun it
I don't, I don't got much self-control, I hope that you runnin
I'm bipolar with the switch up just as quick like you cummin
I don't, I don't got much self-control, I hope that you run it

[Eminem]
I'm not a cheater but if I'ma be accused, might as well be
You tell me you'll take me back when hell freezes, but females be
rushin me outside my telly, temptation overwhelms me
Like my monthly bill from Sprint, they chargin me for a selfie/cell fee
Chargin me, so I gave my hotel key
Ehh, I was tryna be nice

[Chorus] - sung with Eminem

[Interlude: Jessie Reyez + Eminem]
Suck my dick, you fuckin suck bitch
Suck my dick (bitch) you fuckin suck man
I hope that your heart get hit by a semi-truck (bitch)
Suck my dick, you fuckin suck bitch

[Jessie Reyez]
I play your music while you suffer like I'm Carmichael Polar
You tied up in the basement while I chill on your sofa
La próxima yo sé que mejor me quedo sola
Estás de buenas que yo ya vendí mi pistola

[Eminem]
I'm an emotional wreck, weak (uh-huh) everything over-affects me (yeah)
When you joke it upsets me (yeah) you say I'm no good at sex
And you think I'm gross and unsexy (uh-huh) I need Scope cause my breath stinks (yep)
You hope I choke on a Pepsi (yep) bitch! You was supposed to correct me (oh)
Been textin you since 3, I still get no fucking reply
You say you sleep alone, but yet your mattress is king size
Fuck you goin in those knee-high boots? Cut it out, bitch
I doubt that you're goin to house-sit in that outfit, no skin-tight Levi's
Every word that comes out your mouth's a fucking lie
Oh it's spring time, time for you to have a fling like a slingshot
You say don't come over cause you got pink eye, but I think I
got just the thing, why don't I bring my fucking bat and just swing by?
