<verse_start>
Let me explain, just how<end_line>
to make greatness straight out the gate, I'm 'bout to break you down<end_line>
Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake I'm 'bout<end_line>
to rape the al-phabet, I may raise some brows<end_line>
If I press the issue just to get the anger out<end_line>
Full magazine could take Staples out<end_line>
Savage but ain't thinkin 'bout no +Bank Account+<end_line>
But bitch, I'm off the chain like Kala Brown!<end_line>
Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I'm talkin<end_line>
Lil' bitch, I'm sorry, wait<end_line>
What's your talent? Oh, critiquin my talent<end_line>
Oh, bitch, I don't know<end_line>
who the fuck y'all are to give a sub-par bar<end_line>
or even have an opinion of you<end_line>
You mention me, millions of views<end_line>
Attention to news, I mention you<end_line>
Lose-lose for me, win-win for you<end_line>
Billions of views, your ten cents are two<end_line>
Skim through the music to give shit reviews<end_line>
to get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse<end_line>
Don't get misconstrued, business as us'<end_line>
Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do<end_line>
Or get dissed, cause I just don't get<end_line>
what the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin to, do<end_line>
you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow<end_line>
everyone copies though? Probably no<end_line>
Get this fuckin audio out my Audi yo, adi√≥s<end_line>
I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though<end_line>
Not even dissin, it just ain't for me<end_line>
All I am simply is just an MC<end_line>
Maybe "Stan" just isn't your cup of tea<end_line>
Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean<end_line>
Maybe I need to stir up shit, preferably<end_line>
shake the world up if it were up to me<end_line>
Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill<end_line>
I should eat a pill, probably I will<end_line>
Old me kill the new me, watch him bleed to death<end_line>
I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath<end_line>
Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed<end_line>
Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L<end_line>
Jam a Crest Whitestrip<end_line>
in the tip of my dick with an ice pick<end_line>
Stick it in a vice grip, hang it on a spike fence<end_line>
Bang it with a pipe wrench<end_line>
While I take my ballsack and flick it like a light switch<end_line>
Let Vice President Mike Pence back up on my shit in a Sidekick<end_line>
as I lay it on a spike strip<end_line>
These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic since<end_line>
nine-tenths of your rhyme is about ice and<end_line>
Jesus Christ man, how many times is<end_line>
someone gonna fuck on my bitch?<end_line>
You won't ever see Em icy but as cold as I get<end_line>
on the M-I-C, I polarize shit<end_line>
So the temps might freeze and your skull might split<end_line>
like I passed you upside it<end_line>
Bitch I got the club on smash like a nightstick<end_line>
Turn down for what?<end_line>
I ain't loud enough, nah, turn the volume/Valium up<end_line>
Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut<end_line>
now when it doesn't matter what caliber<end_line>
I spit at, I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks<end_line>
you'll turn around and just be like, "Man, how the fuck<end_line>
sourpuss gonna get mad just cause his album sucks<end_line>
and now he wants to take it out on us?"<end_line>
But last week<end_line>
an ex-fan mailed me a copy<end_line>
of "The Mathers LP" to tell me to study<end_line>
It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me<end_line>
I mailed the bitch back<end_line>
and said if I did that<end_line>
I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry<end_line>
Especially an effing "Recovery" clone of me<end_line>
So, finger-bang<end_line>
Chicken wang, MGK, Iggy 'zae<end_line>
Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne<end_line>
I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name<end_line>
I'm fed up with bein +Humble+<end_line>
And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard bumblings<end_line>
I heard you wanna rumble, like an empty stomach<end_line>
I heard your mumblin but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo<end_line>
The era that I'm from will pummel you, that's what it's comin to<end_line>
What the fuck you gonna do when you run into it? I'm gonna crumble you<end_line>
And I'll take a number two and dump on you, if you ain't Joyner<end_line>
If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean then you're a goner<end_line>
I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it<end_line>
I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper<end_line>
You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonald's<end_line>
But if you're lookin to get a porterhouse you better go get "Revival"<end_line>
But y'all are actin like I tried to serve you up a slider<end_line>
Maybe the vocals shoulda been Auto-Tuned and you woulda bought it<end_line>
But sayin I no longer got it cause you missed the line and never caught it<end_line>
cause it went over your head because you're too stupid to get it<end_line>
Cause you're mentally retarded but pretend to be the smartest<end_line>
With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist<end_line>
And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless<end_line>
What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest<end_line>
Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it<end_line>
Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin alcoholic<end_line>
With a bottle full of malt liquor but I couldn't bottle this shit any longer<end_line>
The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom<end_line>
If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat, and rise to my feet<end_line>
I don't see why y'all even started with me<end_line>
I get impeached, my enemies die, I don't cease<end_line>
fire 'til at least all are deceased<end_line>
I'm eastside, never be caught slippin, now you see<end_line>
why I don't sleep, not even a wink, I don't blink<end_line>
I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats<end_line>
I don't even close my fuckin eyes when I sneeze!<end_line>
"Oh, man! That BET cypher was weak<end_line>
It was garbage, The Thing ain't even orange<end_line>
Oh my God, that's a reach!"<end_line>
Shout to all my colorblind people<end_line>
Each and everyone of y'all, if you call a fire engine green<end_line>
Aquamarine, or you think water is pink<end_line>
"Dawg, that's a date." "Looks like an olive to me."<end_line>
"Look, there's an apple." "No it's not, it's a peach!"<end_line>
So finger-bang, Pootie Tang<end_line>
Burger King, "Gucci Gang", dookie dang<end_line>
Charlamagne gonna hate anyway, doesn't matter what I say<end_line>
Give me Donkey of the Day, what a way<end_line>
for 2018 to get underway<end_line>
But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say<end_line>
Welcome to the slaughterhouse - bitch!<end_line>
Invite 'em in/vitamin like a One A Day<end_line>
I'm not donecause I feel like the beast of burden<end_line>
That line in the sand, was it even worth it?<end_line>
Cause the way I see people turning's<end_line>
makin it seem worthless, it's startin to defeat the purpose<end_line>
I'm watchin my fan base shrink to thirds and<end_line>
I was just tryin to do the right thing, but word, has<end_line>
the court of public opinion reached a verdict<end_line>
or still yet to be determined?<end_line>
Cause I'm determined to be me, critique the worship<end_line>
But if I could go back, I'd at least reword it<end_line>
And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent<end_line>
sold the dream to that he's deserted<end_line>
But I think it's workin<end_line>
These verses, are makin him a wee bit nervous<end_line>
And he's too scurred to, answer me with words<end_line>
Cause he knows that he will, lyrically get murdered<end_line>
But I know at least he's heard it<end_line>
Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service<end_line>
to meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin him<end_line>
Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists<end_line>
I said, "Only when it comes to ink and lyricists"<end_line>
But my beef is more media journalists<end_line>
Hold up, hold up, hold up<end_line>
I said my beef is more meaty, a journalist<end_line>
can get a mouthful of flesh<end_line>
And yes, I mean eating a penis<end_line>
Cause they been pannin my album to death<end_line>
So I been givin the media fingers<end_line>
Don't wanna turn this to a counselling sesh'<end_line>
But they been puttin me through the ringer/wringer<end_line>
So I ain't ironin shit out with the press<end_line>
But I just took this beat to the cleaners<end_line>
<verse_end>
