Yeah yeah bitch<end_line>
Comin' to a block near you is Dirty Dozen<end_line>
Nasty like a stank slut bitch with 30 husbands<end_line>
When I was five I was already fuckin'<end_line>
And playin' X-Rated cassettes<end_line>
With Teddy Ruxpin<end_line>
I used to walk up and down the block cussin'<end_line>
Locked in youth homes at 6 for glock bustin'<end_line>
I grew up with knot ballers<end_line>
Who got dollars<end_line>
Shot collars with guns and rottweilers<end_line>

Your rap style annoys<end_line>
You rhyme like a bitch<end_line>
Plus I can't stand your voice<end_line>
Bitch you suck, you whack as fuck<end_line>
Eat a dick, you need a brick upside your dome<end_line>
We be the clique runnin' you down in carloads<end_line>
Leavin' you smashed on tar roads<end_line>
Flat line like bar codes<end_line>
