Girl you give me writer's block, I'm at a loss for words<end_line>
My mind's as lost as yours<end_line>
I rack my brain but still no thoughts emerge, never seen no ass as large as yours<end_line>
How much that cost? That's what I call a cause to splurge<end_line>
You drive me bonkers, I'm about to get my swerve on for sure<end_line>
Thought I was pimpin, 'til I felt like Nas the first<end_line>
date cause I think +I Gave You Power+, when I gave you flowers<end_line>
in a vase, a box of chocolates, throat lozengers, cough drops and Certs<end_line>
Probably should've never let me call that job of yours<end_line>
to talk to your boss and ask him if you can take off from work<end_line>
Should've been one of the first signs that caused alert<end_line>
Man we jumped in too fast, cause since then I just can't be apart from her<end_line>
Cause nobody's body's awesomer<end_line>
I lust her and she loves me cause I'm popular<end_line>
But you know this ain't love<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
You were obviously oblivious to me, I<end_line>
swore I was just invisible to you 'til I went to the lengths I did to meet ya<end_line>
Cause you played so hard to get with me from the beginning now I'm in disbelief I<end_line>
never knew that this could be such misery, ah!<end_line>
Cause now you see nothing but me and<end_line>
I don't see nothing but you and I'm about to flip cause we are<end_line>
super-glued in! We stuck to, each other's hips and we can't<end_line>
do anything individually which is to cling on, scared to be a-<end_line>
-lone, can't specifically de-scribe it, I just can't seem to give a reason<end_line>
that's definitive, just need ya, talkin 'bout "I live and breathe ya"<end_line>
And you pretend to be as mentally and <end_line>
physically addicted to me as Wiz Khalifa is to reefer<end_line>
Don't wanna be without you, don't wanna be with you neither<end_line>
Bitch put me in a situation in which it's both I wish to seek cause<end_line>
This ain't love<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I just want you to myself, don't wanna share you with no one else, ah<end_line>
"What the fuck you whispering for?<end_line>
You get on my nerves, you make me sick I think our, relationship it seems to<end_line>
be on the fritz, I mean it's time that we just split and leave the<end_line>
games behind, your frame of mind ain't the same as mine, I think you need to<end_line>
finish developing a little more mentally too<end_line>
Get the picture?" That's a negative Alicia<end_line>
I will never give the +Keys+ up to the crib ever again, no Visa<end_line>
Not even a gift certificate from Tiffany's, ya<end_line>
better have an epiphany slut, guess what? What? The lease up<end_line>
I'm just mad the time it took to disco-<end_line>
-ver you were usin me for loot like I used you for looks, hoe thought you was too good for me, huh?<end_line>
Yeah, toots used to be my, Carrie Underwood, I was your lumberjack<end_line>
But I can't stomach this, I'm leavin you, I'm not coming back<end_line>
She said "The fuck with that, where's my Louisville Slugger at?"<end_line>
She grabbed that fuckin bat and swung it at my head, I barely ducked and that's<end_line>
when she came up with a kick to the nuts twice<end_line>
Steel toe, it would've put a 100-yard field goal through the uprights<end_line>
<verse_end>
