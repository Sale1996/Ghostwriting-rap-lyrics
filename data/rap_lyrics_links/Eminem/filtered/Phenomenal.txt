<verse_start>
Unstoppable, unpoppable thought bubbles<end_line>
Untoppable thoughts, fuckin juggernaut that'll<end_line>
stomp you in a verse<end_line>
Obstacles I'm drawn to 'em, when the going got rough<end_line>
Show 'em what I done thought that was the worse<end_line>
Lil' sissy, who the fuck taught you how to per-<end_line>
-severe? There ain't no situation that you ever had to respond to that's adverse<end_line>
The messiest thing you've ever gone through is your purse<end_line>
Yeah, I don't try like hell but I might as well hang it up like a shelf<end_line>
Gotta keep growin with it, evolve<end_line>
Cause you can keep throwin shit at the wall<end_line>
But you're gonna find that nothing's gonna stick until you apply yourself!<end_line>
Time to slip in that zone 'til I find myself<end_line>
inside the realm where the unknown and boldly go<end_line>
In the waters where nobody else has gone before<end_line>
or willin to go, uncharted, feelin is so<end_line>
bomb, I'm feelin myself, I'm a giant<end_line>
Sometimes I gotta remind myself that<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Let me self-empower you<end_line>
When you're down and they're tryin to clown the fuck out of you<end_line>
When you feel like you're runnin out of fuel<end_line>
I'll show you how to use doubt as fuel, convert it to gunpowder too<end_line>
Now what you do is put the match to the charcoal fluid<end_line>
Put a spark to it like Martha Stewart barbecuing<end_line>
Aww screw it, feel like you wanna hit that wall then do it<end_line>
Punch through it, just cock back, put your ALL into it<end_line>
Now, you gon' take that rage and make that what you raise<end_line>
Never take back what you say<end_line>
If you stay strapped in your brain, engage in this steel cage match<end_line>
Ready to scrap ASAP<end_line>
Take your fists to his bones, show who's +Big+ and who's smallest<end_line>
You're Christopher Wallace, yeah I picture 'em all as<end_line>
plastic and foam and it lays flat where you put your dinner plates at<end_line>
And set it on it like a placemat!<end_line>
... And I want you to SAY that!<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Got a fuckin mouth, with no shut-off valve<end_line>
Can't even cut a power to it, but it's what allowed<end_line>
me to come up out from under the fuckin ground cause I worked my butt off now<end_line>
It's a subject that I don't know how to shut up about<end_line>
Cause I stuck it out<end_line>
Like a motherfuckin tongue, that's how I responded when I got shoved around<end_line>
You're gonna have non-believers<end_line>
But when you're beyond belief you probably shouldn't wonder how<end_line>
Get it how you live<end_line>
But are you prepared to give more than you get?<end_line>
And put in twice what you get back from this shit<end_line>
Though what you sacrifice barely is half, never give, rap is my shiv<end_line>
But it's like my shield at the same time I wield<end_line>
I'ma knife this will, sometimes I feel just like B. Real from Cypress Hill<end_line>
How I can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt<end_line>
I rhyme like life is still<end_line>
an uphill climb, ready to face it, each challenge waitin<end_line>
Can taste it, it's salivation, I'm wagin retaliation<end_line>
Look what I have built, reputation is validation<end_line>
The only thing I'm capable of makin is amazing<end_line>
Only thing you're capable of makin is a false statement<end_line>
An accusation - I'm legendary status<end_line>
In fact, that is the only way you'll ever be able to say<end_line>
Your legend is, makin an allegation!<end_line>
I write with the left<end_line>
Same hand I hold the mic with, as I fight to the death<end_line>
'til my last breath, managed<end_line>
to prove who the best man is, prevailin<end_line>
All cards be the only one left standin<end_line>
In the end, but I ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage<end_line>
of knowin what it's like to be +Southpaw+<end_line>
Cause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed!<end_line>
<verse_end>
