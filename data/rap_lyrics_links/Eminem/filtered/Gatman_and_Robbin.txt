Motherfucker, you retarded you touch 50<end_line>
I'll leave you dead, leave you dearly departed<end_line>
We're walkin' away from a beef, in which clearly you started<end_line>
I said we're walkin' away, did you hear me you wanna be thankful<end_line>
That we ain't beefin' we're still breathin' and just leave it at THAT<end_line>
Cause if me and 50 and G-Unit hop back in that BAT mobile<end_line>
It ain't gonna be no more rappin', it's gonna be BRAAAAT<end_line>
Retaliation will be like them muslim Shi'ite ATTACKS<end_line>
Some where along the line, its like me and 50 made a PACT<end_line>
He's got my back, I got his, back<end_line>
It's almost like we're kinda like Siamese twins<end_line>
Cause when we beef we pull each other in<end_line>
to the bullshit like we're conjoined at the hip<end_line>
It's just unavoidable some of this shit is washable<end_line>
And some shit will never boil up<end_line>
And some of it will just simmer at best<end_line>
If left alone, we'll let it be so there won't be no sit downs<end_line>
With no Ray Benzinos, there will no peace discussions with me<end_line>
There ain't gon' be no friendly debates over crumpets and tea<end_line>
Just quit fuckin' with me and I'll gladly quit fuckin' with you<end_line>
Just spit ya sixteen and do what you gotta do to get through<end_line>
Without mentionin me and the machine or Jimmy Iovine and Dre and 50<end_line>
or D-Twizzie, Obie and just let it be or we'll be back with a<end_line>
<verse_end>
