<verse_start>
Rihanna just hit me on the text<end_line>
Last night I left hickeys on her neck<end_line>
Wait, you just dissed me? I'm perplexed<end_line>
Insult me in a line, compliment me on the next<end_line>
Damn, I'm really sorry you want me to have a heart attack<end_line>
Was watchin "8 Mile" on my NordicTrack<end_line>
Realized I forgot to call you back<end_line>
Here's that autograph for your daughter, I wrote it on a Starter cap<end_line>
Stan, Stan, son<end_line>
Listen, man, Dad isn't mad<end_line>
But, how you, gonna, name yourself, after a damn gun<end_line>
and have a man-bun?<end_line>
The giant's woke, eyes open, undeniable<end_line>
Supplyin smoke, got the fire stoked<end_line>
Say you got me in a scope, but you grazed me<end_line>
I say one call to Interscope and you're Swayze<end_line>
Your reply got the crowd yelling, "Woo!"<end_line>
So before you die let's see who can out-petty who<end_line>
With your corny lines, "Slim, you're old!" Ow Kelly, ooh<end_line>
But I'm 45 and I'm still outselling you<end_line>
By 29, I had three albums that had blew<end_line>
Now let's talk about somethin I don't really do<end_line>
Go in someone's daughter's mouth stealin food<end_line>
But you're a fuckin mole hill, I'ma make a mountain out of you<end_line>
Hoe chill - actin like you put the chrome barrel to my bone marrow<end_line>
Gunner? Bitch you ain't a bow and arrow<end_line>
Say you'll run up on me like a phone bill<end_line>
Sprayin leadplayin dead, that's the only time you hold still/steel<end_line>
Are you eating cereal, or oatmeal?<end_line>
What the fuck's in the bowl, milk?<end_line>
Wheaties or Cheerios? Cause I'm takin a shit in 'em, Kelly<end_line>
I need reading material - dictionary<end_line>
"Yo Slim, your last four albums sucked<end_line>
Go back to 'Recovery'," oh shoot<end_line>
That was three albums ago, what do you know? Oops<end_line>
Know your facts before you come at me, lil' goof<end_line>
Luxury, oh, you broke bitch? Yeah, I had enough money in '02<end_line>
to burn it in front of you, hoe<end_line>
Younger me? No, you're the wack me, it's funny but so true<end_line>
I'd rather be 80-year-old me than 20-year-old you<end_line>
'Til I'm hitting old age<end_line>
Still can fill a whole page with a 10-year-old's rage<end_line>
Got more fans than you in your own city, lil' kiddie go play<end_line>
Feel like I'm babysitting Lil Tay<end_line>
Got the Diddy okay so you spent your whole day<end_line>
shootin a video just to fuckin dig your own grave<end_line>
Got you at your own wake<end_line>
I'm the billy goat, you ain't never made a list next to no Biggie, no Jay<end_line>
Next to Taylor Swift, and that Iggy hoe, you about to really blow<end_line>
Kelly, they'll be putting your name<end_line>
next to Ja, next to Benzino<end_line>
Die motherfucker like the last motherfucker sayin Hailie in vain<end_line>
Alien brain, you Satanist<end_line>
My biggest flops are your greatest hits<end_line>
The game's mine again and ain't nothin changed but the locks/LOX<end_line>
So before I slay this bitch I, mwah, give Jade-a-kiss<end_line>
Gotta wake up Labor Day to this?<end_line>
Bein rich-shamed by some prick usin my name for clickbait in a state of bliss<end_line>
cause I said his goddamn name<end_line>
Now I gotta cock back, aim<end_line>
Yeah bitch, pop champagne to this<end_line>
It's your moment<end_line>
This is it, as big as you're gonna get, so enjoy it<end_line>
Had to give you a career to destroy it<end_line>
Lethal injection<end_line>
Go to sleep six feet deep, I'll give you a B for the effort<end_line>
But if I was 3-foot-11 you'd look up to me and for the record<end_line>
You would suck a dick to fuckin be me for a second!<end_line>
Lick a ballsack to get on my channel<end_line>
Give your life to be as solidified, this motherfuckin shit is like Rambo<end_line>
when he's out of bullets<end_line>
So what good is a fuckin +Machine Gun+ when it's out of ammo?<end_line>
Had enough of this tatted-up mumble rapper, how the fuck can him and I battle?<end_line>
He'll have to fuck Kim in my flannel<end_line>
I'll give him my sandals<end_line>
Cause he knows long as I'm Shady, he's gon' have to live in my shadow!<end_line>
Exhausting, letting off on my offspring<end_line>
Like a gun barrel, bitch, get off me!<end_line>
You dance around it like a sombrero, we can all see you're fuckin salty<end_line>
cause Young Gerald's balls-deep inside of Halsey<end_line>
Your red sweater, your black leather<end_line>
You dress better, I rap better<end_line>
That a death threat or, a love letter?<end_line>
Little white toothpick<end_line>
thinks it's over a pic, I just don't like you prick<end_line>
Thanks for dissing me, now I had an excuse on the mic to write "Not Alike"<end_line>
But really I don't care who's in the right<end_line>
But you're losin the fight you picked<end_line>
Who else, want it? Kell's<end_line>
attempt, fails; Budden? L's<end_line>
Fuckin, nails<end_line>
in these, coffins as soft as, Cottonelle<end_line>
Killshot, I will not fail, I'm with the Doc still<end_line>
But this idiot's boss pops pills and tells him he's got skills<end_line>
But Kells, the day you put out a hit's<end_line>
the day Diddy admits that he put the hit out that got 'Pac kill-ah!<end_line>
I'm sick of you bein wack and still usin that motherfuckin Auto-Tune<end_line>
So let's talk about it<end_line>
I'm sick of your mumble rap mouth, need to get the cock up out it<end_line>
before we can even talk about it<end_line>
I'm sick of your blonde hair and earrings, just cause you look in the mirror and think<end_line>
that you're Marshall Mathers<end_line>
don't mean you are and you're not about it<end_line>
So just leave my dick in your mouth and keep my daughter out it<end_line>
You fuckin..<end_line>
