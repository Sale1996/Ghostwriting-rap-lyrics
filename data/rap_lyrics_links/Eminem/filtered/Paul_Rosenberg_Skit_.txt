Em, it's Paul<end_line>
Joel just called me and he told me you're in the fucking back behind the studio<end_line>
Shooting your gun off in the air like it's a shooting range<end_line>
I told you not to fucking bring your gun around, like an idiot, outside of your home<end_line>
You're gonna get yourself in trouble<end_line>
DON'T bring your gun outside of your home, you can't carry it on you<end_line>
Leave your fuckin' gun at home<end_line>
