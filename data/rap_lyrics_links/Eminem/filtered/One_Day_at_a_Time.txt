We can only learn to take, our anger and our hate<end_line>
Control our mental stakes, settle down and set it straight<end_line>
Maybe we can learn to take a second to pump the brakes<end_line>
Before we said it, regret it later and let it escalate <end_line>
Cuz by then its just too late, there's so much we can take<end_line>
And there's only so much someone can swallow and tolerate<end_line>
To the point that he just brakes, snaps, and its all it takes<end_line>
You think that we was learnin from other rappers mistakes<end_line>
But we ain't, its plain to go against, <end_line>
With every artist comes the image he portrays and the picture that he paints<end_line>
But in the mist of all this anger and this angst <end_line>
Never once did you heard me say I'm a gangster and I aint hear any complaints<end_line>
But I know, that I will always continue to grow<end_line>
As long as I lead, and never follow no one else's shadow<end_line>
There will never be another me, and that I can guarantee <end_line>
That's why the fuck I remain sucker free<end_line>
To this day, the game, will never be the same<end_line>
No matter how much fame and success they attain<end_line>
There will never be another me <end_line>
And no matter what they do, there will never be another you<end_line>
You can search but you'll never find<end_line>
You can try to rewind time, but in your hearts and your minds<end_line>
We will never die, we are forever alive<end_line>

My heart ????, we passed that<end_line>
I'm tryin to keep ???? keep comin and collect all my ass cap<end_line>
The rappers in the game ain't change<end_line>
And I finally realize that we not in the same game<end_line>
The hatin' will never end, so I guess I'll deal with it<end_line>
Them .45's will pop killa's, yes I'm still with it<end_line>
The streets is military, you gotta be a soldier<end_line>
Gotta stay leery, and keep your eyes on the rollers<end_line>
They do what they gotta do to shock them and hold us<end_line>
So we gotta do what we gotta do to keep rollin<end_line>
One way at a time, keep the faith in your mind<end_line>
<verse_end>
