Uhh, we 'bout to get into a tale of a gunner that details the dungeon<end_line>
Just as the pale moon illuminates the hail and thunderin<end_line>
'01's the year where I fell from blunderin<end_line>
Shady lifted his wing then I fell from under it<end_line>
Now I'm free-fallin, my career has gone into recallin<end_line>
Regardless of who's fault I was speed ballin<end_line>
God bubble wrapped me and dropped me on top of the Earth<end_line>
Then Marshall double backed and got me from on top of a hearse<end_line>
I'm alive nigga<end_line>
Justin T. ain't got nothin on me cause I done cried Mary J. Blige rivers<end_line>
I realized that God's with us<end_line>
Soon as I decided to put that bottle down and, pick up my Todd Bridges<end_line>
The writin's on the wall - since niggaz seen me <end_line>
at the baseball game with Shady and Jay-Z, suddenly everybody calls<end_line>
Like, "I'm just checkin on you dawg"<end_line>
While I throw up this message on the stall<end_line>
<verse_end>

Your body language is sayin your confidence is gone<end_line>
Well pick ya ass up lil' homie, come on<end_line>
You just gon' sit there and take it or make 'em suck it?<end_line>
Tell 'em where to shove it<end_line>
Straight up, you gon' make love to the world or you gon' FUCK it?<end_line>
The last time that life kicked me in the ass<end_line>
I pulled down its pants and put a foot up its ass<end_line>
Man what a catastrophe it'd be for me to be a bitch ass pussy<end_line>
and not open a can of whoop-ass, let you pissants whoop me<end_line>
would be the day I say I ate poop<end_line>
Shit, the day that I don't straight shoot I'll drop out of my anti-woman hate group<end_line>
Say I'm a sissy faggot, record it, play it back and put it on straight loop<end_line>
You haters look like you ate a grapefruit!<end_line>
You see me climbin back on that wagon, got my swagger back, I was draggin<end_line>
Hopped back on it, grabbed the reigns on that bastard<end_line>
and came back on 'em without remorse, man of course<end_line>
I'm a one-trick pony, cause I'll be screamin on these whores 'til I'm hoarse/horse!<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
There's a bomb inside my head, I'm a live wire<end_line>
I am on the edge, teeterin on it like a totter, I might <end_line>
get on a nut like a tire iron; I have no desire stoppin<end_line>
So why would I drop and roll? That's how much on fire I AM!<end_line>
Rappers are fun and I'm the time cause I'm just flyin by 'em<end_line>
And I'm laughin at 'em the entire time, why am I up?<end_line>
Cause tribulations I have triumphed, bitch I'm fired up<end_line>
So one time for me just let your fuckin lighters light the SKY UP~!<end_line>
<verse_end>
