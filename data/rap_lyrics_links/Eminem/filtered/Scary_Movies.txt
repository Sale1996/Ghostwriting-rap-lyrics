<verse_start>
The one man on the planet that'll drive off of the Grand Canyon<end_line>
Hop out of a Grand Am and land in it handstandin<end_line>
Any man plannin to battle will get snatched out of his clothes<end_line>
so fast it'll look like an invisible man standin<end_line>
I'm headed for Hell, I'd rather be dead or in jail<end_line>
Bill Clinton, hit thisand you better inhale<end_line>
Cause any MC that chooses to go against me<end_line>
is gettin takin advantage of like Monica Lewinksy<end_line>
Came home in a frenzy, pushin a ten speed<end_line>
Screamin to Aunt Peg<end_line>
with three spokes stickin out of my pant leg<end_line>
Fuck a headache, give me a migraine <end_line>
Damnit I like pain<end_line>
and you should be anywhere that a mic ain't<end_line>
You rap knowin you wack<end_line>
You act up and I'm throwin you down a flight of steps<end_line>
then I'm throwin you back up em<end_line>
If they don't like the track, fuck em<end_line>
The rap struck em harder then gettin hit by a Mack truck<end_line>
and then backed up on<end_line>
And any half-assed known rapper to trespass<end_line>
better be ready for the second Celebrity Deathmatch<end_line>
So tell the medic to bring the medication and quickly<end_line>
I'm sicker than a Tupac dedication to Biggie<end_line>
I'm free-fallin feet first out of a damn tree<end_line>
to stampede your chest 'til you can't breathe<end_line>
And when I'm down to my last breath<end_line>
I'ma climb the Empire State Building and get to the last step<end_line>
and still have half left<end_line>
