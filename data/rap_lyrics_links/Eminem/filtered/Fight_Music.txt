<verse_start>
If I could capture the rage of today's youth and bottle it<end_line>
Crush the glass from my bare hands and swallow it<end_line>
Then spit it back in the faces of you racists<end_line>
and hypocrites who think the same shit but don't say shit<end_line>
You Liberace's, Versace's, and you nazis<end_line>
Watch me, cause you thinkin you got me in this hot seat<end_line>
You motherfuckers wanna JUDGE me cause you're NOT me<end_line>
You'll never STOP me, I'm TOP speed as you POP me<end_line>
I came to save these new generations of babies<end_line>
from parents who failed to raise 'em cause they're lazy<end_line>
to grow to praise me I'm makin 'em go crazy<end_line>
That's how I got this whole nation to embrace me<end_line>
And you fugazi if you think I'ma admit wrong<end_line>
I cripple any hypocritic critic I'm sic'd on<end_line>
And this song is for any kid who gets picked on<end_line>
A sick song to retaliate to, and it's called..<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
It's fight music!<end_line>
