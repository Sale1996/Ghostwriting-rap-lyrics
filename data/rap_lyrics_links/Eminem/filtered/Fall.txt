Gotta concentrate, against the clock I race<end_line>
Got no time to waste, I'm already late, I got a marathoner's pace<end_line>
Went from addict to a workaholic, word to Dr. Dre<end_line>
and that first marijuana tape, guess I got a +Chronic+ case<end_line>
And I ain't just blowin smoke, 'less it's in your momma's face<end_line>
I know this time Paul and Dre, they won't tell me what not to say<end_line>
And though me and my party days have all pretty much parted ways<end_line>
You'd swear to God I forgot I'm the guy that made "Not Afraid"<end_line>
One last time for Charlamagne, if my response is late<end_line>
It's just how long it takes to hit my fuckin radar, I'm so far away<end_line>
These rappers are like "Hunger Games", one minute they're +Mocking-Jay+<end_line>
Next minute they get their style from Migos, 'til they copy Drake<end_line>
Maybe I just don't know when to turn around and walk away<end_line>
But all the hate, I call it "Walk on Water"-gate, I've had as much as I can tolerate<end_line>
I'm sick and tired of waitin, I done lost my patience<end_line>
I can take all of you motherfuckers on at once, you wanted Shady?<end_line>
You got it!<end_line>

Somebody tell Budden before I snap, he better fasten it<end_line>
Or have his body bag get zipped, the closest thing he's had to hits is smackin bitches<end_line>
And don't make me have to give it back to Akademiks<end_line>
Say this shit is trash again I'll have you twisted<end_line>
like you had it when you thought you had me slippin<end_line>
at the telly, even when I'm gettin brain you'll never catch me with a THOT, lacking with it<end_line>
"He ain't spittin like this on his last shit!" Hoe you better go back and listen<end_line>
You know me better, thinkin I'll slow or let up, call it trap cause it's a<end_line>
total setup hopin that you rappers fall in that<end_line>
Dre said, "Hold your head up!" Kathy Griffin<end_line>
Stackin ammunition, slap the clip and cock it back on competition<end_line>
This is how I shot aheadGabby Giffords<end_line>
My attack is vicious, Jack the Ripper, back in business<end_line>
Tyler +Create+ nothin, I see why you called yourself abitch<end_line>
It's not just cause you lack attention<end_line>
It's because you worship D12's balls, you're sack-religious<end_line>
If you're gonna critique me, you better at least be as good or better<end_line>
Get Earl the Hooded Sweater, whatever his name is to help you put together<end_line>
some words, more than just two letters<end_line>
The fans waited for this moment like that feature when I stole the show<end_line>
Sorry if I took +Forever+<end_line>

<verse_start>
Just remember, I was here before you<end_line>
And I'll be here after you, make your run-in for you<end_line>
Detractors, I might have to fuck Pitchfork with a corkscrew<end_line>
Just what the doctor ordered; revenge is the best medicine, increase the dose<end_line>
from least to most and then tell the Grammys to go<end_line>
and fuck themselves, they suck the blood from all the biggest artists like some leeches so<end_line>
they nominate 'em, get 'em there, get a name to 'em, see the show<end_line>
Every parasite needs a host<end_line>
Then give Album of the Year to somebody that no one's ever even heard of<end_line>
All I know is I wrote every single word of everything I ever murdered<end_line>
Time to separate the sheep from goats<end_line>
And I got no faith in your writers, I don't believe in ghosts<end_line>
When rap needed it most, I was that wing and the prayer<end_line>
A beacon of hope, put a B-I-R-D in the air<end_line>
Somewhere some kid is bumpin this while he lip-syncs in the mirror<end_line>
That's who I'm doin it for, the rest I don't really even care<end_line>
But you would think I'm carryin an Oxford dictionary in my pocket<end_line>
how I'm buryin these artists, on the scale it turns to minus<end_line>
Mines is various as hardly and what's scary is you probably<end_line>
can compare me to your car cause I'm just barely gettin started<end_line>
And far as Lord Jamar, you better leave me the hell alone<end_line>
Or I'll show you an Elvis clone<end_line>
Walk up in this house you own, thrust my pelvic bone, use your telephone<end_line>
and go fetch me the remote, put my feet up and just make myself at home<end_line>
I belong here, clown, don't tell me 'bout the culture<end_line>
I inspire the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, the<end_line>
Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9"s, and oh<end_line>
Brought the world 50 Cent, you did squat, piss and moan<end_line>
But I'm not gonna fall, bitch!<end_line>
