<verse_start>
I have said a lot of things in my day, I admit it<end_line>
This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it<end_line>
I done won a couple Grammys but I sold my soul to get 'em<end_line>
Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin recognition<end_line>
Fuck's the difference? I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules<end_line>
Man I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose<end_line>
I been eatin long enough? Man my stomach should be full, I just ate<end_line>
Lick the plate, my buffet, lucky me, fuck you think?<end_line>
I got a couple of mansions, still I don't have any manors/manners<end_line>
You got a couple of ghost writers but to these kids it don't actually matter<end_line>
They're askin me, "What the fuck happened to hip-hop?" I said, "I don't have any answers"<end_line>
Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album, it hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers<end_line>
And actually comin from humble beginnings, I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning<end_line>
I wish I could say "What a wonderful feeling!" We're on the upswing like we're punchin the ceiling<end_line>
But nothin is feeling like anyone has any fuckin ability to even stick to a subject<end_line>
It's killin me, the inability to pin humility, hatata-batata, why don't we make a bunch of<end_line>
fuckin songs about nothin and mumble 'em! Fuck it, I'm goin for the jugular/juggler<end_line>
Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin up don't give an ounce of a motherfuck<end_line>
about the ones that were here before you to make raps, let's recap, way back<end_line>
MC's that, wreak havoc on tape decks, ADAT's with the G Raps, and Kane's hat<end_line>
We need 3 Stacks, ASAP, and bring Masta Ace back, cause half of these rappers<end_line>
have brain damage, all the lean rappin, face tats, syruped out like tree sap<end_line>
I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad, but in fact, where the old me at?<end_line>
The same cat that would take that, feed-back, and aim back, I need that!<end_line>
But I think it's inevitable, they know what button to press<end_line>
or what lever to pull to get me to snap though<end_line>
And if I'm payin attention I'm probably makin it bigger<end_line>
but you've been takin the dicks in the fuckin back hoe<end_line>
On the brink in a minute, got me thinkin of finishin<end_line>
everything with acetaminophen and reapin the benefits<end_line>
I'm asleep at the wheel again as I peak into thinkin about<end_line>
an evil intent of another beat I'ma kill again<end_line>
Cause even if I gotta end up eating a pill again<end_line>
Even ketamine or methamphetamine with a minithin<end_line>
It better be at least 70 to 300 milligram<end_line>
and I might as well cause I'ma end up bein a villain again<end_line>
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator<end_line>
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin record breaker<end_line>
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record<end_line>
Nobody could ever take away the legacy, I made a navigator<end_line>
Motherfucker know I got a right to be this way, I got spite inside my DNA<end_line>
But I rode 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin tirelessly, ayy<end_line>
It's the moment y'all been waitin for, like California wishin rain would pour<end_line>
And that drought y'all been prayin for, my downfall<end_line>
From the "8 Mile" to the "Southpaw" still the same Marshall, that outlaw<end_line>
that they say as a writer/rider might've fell off, I'm back on that bull like the cowboy<end_line>
