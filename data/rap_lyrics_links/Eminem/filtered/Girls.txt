Hey yo dawg<end_line>
I got some shit on my motherfuckin chest that<end_line>
I need to get off cause, if I don't<end_line>
I'ma fuckin explode, or somethin<end_line>
Now look - this is a story about<end_line>
some little fuckin girls that I know<end_line>
It goes like this..<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
It's so easy for me to make enemies any more it's sickening<end_line>
People are lookin for an excuse to jump on my shitlist<end_line>
Stickin their noses in shit that isn't none of their business<end_line>
I never asked, cared, gave a fuck, or wanted opinions<end_line>
Now I'm in the position that, I don't wanna be in - shit<end_line>
I never had no beef with your corny son of a bitches<end_line>
But now the shit is broke and you can't do nothin to fix it<end_line>
So I'm tellin you right now - motherFUCK a Limp Bizkit<end_line>
Now I'ma be real, B-Real was real<end_line>
He ain't say shit the whole time me and Whitey was beefin;<end_line>
see he chilled<end_line>
He was cool with the whole situation and kept it neutral<end_line>
I'd have never involved my crew if it wasn't for Pupils<end_line>
Peoples, whatever your backpackin cypherin name is<end_line>
Had I not opened a magazine and seen what you sayin and<end_line>
I'da never involved you, but you had to add your two pennies<end_line>
Now I gotta go grab my shitlist and add some new enemies<end_line>
Hit the studio and I'll admit, I had a few in me<end_line>
Fuck it, I roasted you, I ain't mad at you any<end_line>
But let it be known that song was never released, it leaked<end_line>
I'da never gave you that much attention intentionally<end_line>
Then I look on the TV, now look who's mentionin me<end_line>
That little fuckin weasel, DJ Lethal, on MTV<end_line>
After I gave you props in that song, you on national TV<end_line>
Talkin bout Everlast is gonna whip my ass when he sees me?<end_line>
Come on dawg, you was supposed to be on that song<end_line>
Talkin bout how bad you hate him, now you all on his thong?<end_line>
What's wrong? You scared, and Fred, you said you was dissin him too<end_line>
I shoulda knew better than to listen to you<end_line>
You fuckin sissy, up on stage, screamin how people hate you<end_line>
They don't hate you<end_line>
They just think you're corny since Christina played you<end_line>
And I dare you motherfuckers to try to diss me back<end_line>
That's a sissy act, and don't call me kissin my ass<end_line>
Cause I swear to God this ain't just a song I'm tryin to pre-warn you<end_line>
Lethal when I fuckin see you dawg I'm swingin on you!<end_line>
Motherfuckers must think cause I'm in trouble with the law<end_line>
that I won't jaw 'em, up my sentence and double it tomorrow<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Now I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs, to be involved in my beefs<end_line>
I'm a man, I can stand on my feet<end_line>
So if you don't wanna be in 'em all I ask<end_line>
is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion<end_line>
and I won't put you in 'em<end_line>
Cuz I don't ask nobody to share my beliefs, to be involved in my beefs<end_line>
I'm a man, I can stand on my feet<end_line>
So if you don't wanna be in 'em all I ask<end_line>
is that you don't open your mouth with an opinion<end_line>
and I won't put you in 'em<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Now see if you diss me and I respond, the beef is on<end_line>
But if I help you sell one record<end_line>
and I see you at a show, I'll strip you naked<end_line>
See I was smart, I came back and scooped up my friends<end_line>
Now I got five dawgs that'll die for me like I'll die for them<end_line>
I'll fight for them, swing or shoot like I fight for Kim<end_line>
All of 'em been with me through this fucked up life that I'm in<end_line>
That goes for all of my dogs, from Royce to Dre<end_line>
From Xzibit to Mel-Man, 'til I'm hoist away<end_line>
in my coffin I'll never soften no matter how often I'm tested<end_line>
I'll never give a fuck, I won't never be interested<end_line>
Love me or hate me as much as Fred wants to be hated<end_line>
I will solemnly stand by every statement I stated<end_line>
This shit that I been through my pencil never could pencil<end_line>
But I will never be this gullible ever again though<end_line>
Next time I'll know when someone's copyin off me<end_line>
I'm not bein cocky, I just know when somebody's mockin me<end_line>
I stick up my middle finger, he sticks up his finger<end_line>
I say "Fuck Christina" he says "Fuck Christina" but meaner<end_line>
So from doin a song with Method to beggin to get accepted<end_line>
I'm peggin Fred with the bottle of dye that he bleached his head with<end_line>
And as for Lethal, don't forget what I said<end_line>
I'm fuckin you up punk, you're dead! Don't think that I'm playin<end_line>
And fuck BIZKIT! Cause I know you're sayin fuck D-12<end_line>
Only not to our face, under your breath, to yourselves<end_line>

And that's it, that's all there is to it dawg<end_line>
If you didn't wanna do the fuckin song<end_line>
don't say you're down with doin the fuckin song<end_line>
and then back out at the last minute<end_line>
And then go on motherfuckin MTV talkin about<end_line>
Everlast can whip my motherfuckin ass<end_line>
If you're scared of Whitey Ford dog<end_line>
just say you're scared of Whitey Ford, that's it<end_line>
That's all you had to fuckin say, I wouldn'ta said shit<end_line>
I woulda backed off, did the motherfuckin song myself<end_line>
and not put you motherfuckers in it, that's all<end_line>
Now I ain't even on no rap shit no more<end_line>
I'm on some fuckin-you-up shit when I see you<end_line>
And I will see you too; oh, and by the way Fred<end_line>
That wasn't an accident<end_line>
I didn't mean to give you a play at the Music Awards<end_line>
