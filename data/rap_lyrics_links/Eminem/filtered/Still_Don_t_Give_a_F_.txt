A lot of people ask me.. am I afraid of death..<end_line>
Hell yeah I'm afraid of death<end_line>
I don't want to die yet<end_line>
A lot of people think.. that I worship the devil..<end_line>
that I do all types of.. retarded shit<end_line>
Look, I can't change the way I think<end_line>
And I can't change the way I am<end_line>
But if I offended you?  Good<end_line>
Cause I still don't give a fuck<end_line>

I'm zonin off of one joint, stoppin a limo<end_line>
Hopped in the window, shoppin a demo at gunpoint<end_line>
A lyricist without a clue, what year is this?<end_line>
Fuck a needle, here's a sword, bodypierce with this<end_line>
Livin amuk, never givin a fuck<end_line>
Gimme the keys I'm drunk, and I've never driven a truck<end_line>
But I smoke dope in a cab<end_line>
I'll stab you with the sharpest knife I can grab<end_line>
Come back the next week and re-open your scab<end_line>
A killer instinct runs in the blood<end_line>
Emptyin full clips and buryin guns in the mud<end_line>
I've calmed down now -- I was heavy once into drugs<end_line>
I could walk around straight for two months with a buzz<end_line>
My brain's gone, my soul's worn and my spirit is torn<end_line>
The rest of my body's still bein operated on<end_line>
I'm ducked the fuck down while I'm writin this rhyme<end_line>
Cause I'm probably gonna get struck with lightnin this time<end_line>
<verse_end>

For all the weed that I've smoked - yo this blunt's for you<end_line>
To all the people I've offended - yeah fuck you too!<end_line>
To all the friends I used to have - yo I miss my past<end_line>
But the rest of you assholes can KISS MY ASS<end_line>
For all the drugs that I've done - yo I'm still gon' do<end_line>
To all the people I've offended - yeah fuck you too!<end_line>
For everytime I reminisce - yo I miss my past<end_line>
But I still don't give a fuck, y'all can KISS MY ASS<end_line>

I walked into a gunfight with a knife to kill you<end_line>
And cut you so fast when your blood spilled it was still blue<end_line>
I'll hang you til you dangle and chain you with both ankles<end_line>
And pull you apart from both angles<end_line>
I wanna crush your skull til your brains leaks out of your veins<end_line>
And bust open like broken water mains<end_line>
So tell Saddam not to bother with makin another bomb <end_line>
Cause I'm crushin the whole world in my palm<end_line>
Got your girl on my arm and I'm armed with a firearm<end_line>
So big my entire arm is a giant firebomb<end_line>
Buy your mom a shirt with a Slim Shady iron-on<end_line>
And the pants to match<end_line>
I get imaginative with a mouth full of adjectives,<end_line>
a brain full of adverbs, and a box full of laxatives<end_line>
 Causin hospital accidents<end_line>
God help me before I commit some irresponsible acts again <end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I wanted an album so rugged nobody could touch it<end_line>
Spend a million a track and went over my budget<end_line>
Now how in the fuck am I supposed to get out of debt?<end_line>
I can't rap anymore - I just murdered the alphabet<end_line>
Drug sickness got me doin some bugged twitches<end_line>
I'm withdrawn from crack so bad my blood itches<end_line>
I don't rap to get the women - fuck bitches <end_line>
Give me a fat slut that cooks and does dishes<end_line>
Never ran with a click - I'm a posse<end_line>
Kamikaze, strappin a motherfuckin bomb across me<end_line>
From the second I was born, my momma lost me <end_line>
I'm a cross between Manson, Esham and Ozzy<end_line>
I don't know why the fuck I'm here in the first place <end_line>
My worst day on this earth was my first birthday<end_line>
Retarded?  What did that nurse say?  Brain damage?<end_line>
Fuck, I was born during the earthquake<end_line>
