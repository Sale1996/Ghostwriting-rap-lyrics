Hello boys and girls!<end_line>
Today we're gonna talk about father and daughter relationships<end_line>
Do you have a daddy? I'll bet you do!<end_line>
Who's your daddy?<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
There's no mountain I can't climb, there's no tower too high<end_line>
No plane that I can't learn how to fly<end_line>
What do I gotta do to get through to you<end_line>
to show you there ain't nothin I can't take this chainsaw to?<end_line>
Fuckin brains, brawn and brass balls<end_line>
I cut 'em off, and got 'em pickled and bronzed in a glass jar<end_line>
inside of a hall with my framed autographed sunglasses<end_line>
with Elton John's name, on my drag wall<end_line>
I'm out the closet, I've been lyin my ass off<end_line>
All this time me and Dre been fuckin with hats off<end_line>
So tell Laura and her husband to back off<end_line>
'fore I push this motherfuckin button and blast off<end_line>
and launch one at these Russians and that's all<end_line>
Blow every fuckin thing except Afghanistan on the map off<end_line>
When will it stop? When will I knock the crap off?<end_line>
Hailie, tell 'em baby -<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
It's like my mother always told me<end_line>
Rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana rana and codeine<end_line>
and God dammit you little motherfucker<end_line>
If you ain't got nuthin nice to say then don't say nuthin<end_line>
... uh, fuck that shit bitch!<end_line>
Eat a motherfuckin dick, chew on a prick<end_line>
and lick a million motherfuckin cocks per second<end_line>
I'd rather put out a motherfuckin gospel record<end_line>
I'd rather be a pussy-whipped bitch, eat pussy<end_line>
and have pussy lips glued to my face with a clit ring<end_line>
in my nose than quit bringin my flows<end_line>
Quit givin me my ammo; can't you see why I'm so mean?<end_line>
If y'all leave me alone this wouldn't be my M.O.<end_line>
I wouldn't have to go eenee-meene-mini-moe<end_line>
Catch a homo by his toe, man I don't know no more<end_line>
Am I the only fuckin one who's normal any more?<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
My songs can make you cry, take you by surprise<end_line>
at the same time, can make you dry your eyes<end_line>
with the same rhyme; see what you're seein is a genius at work<end_line>
Which to me isn't work<end_line>
So it's easy to misinterpret it at first<end_line>
cause when I speak, it's tongue-in-cheek<end_line>
I'd yank my fuckin teeth<end_line>
Before I'd ever bite my tongue, I'd slice my gums<end_line>
Get struck by fuckin lightnin twice at once<end_line>
and die and come back as Vanilla Ice's son<end_line>
And walk around the rest of my life spit on<end_line>
and kicked and hit with shit everytime I sung<end_line>
like R. Kelly as soon as "Bump and Grind" comes on<end_line>
More pain inside of my brain than the eyes of a little girl<end_line>
inside of a plane, aimed at the World Trade<end_line>
Standin on Ronnie's grave, screamin at the sky<end_line>
'til clouds gather it's Clyde Mathers and Bonnie Jade<end_line>
And that's pretty much the gist of it<end_line>
The parents are pissed but the kids love it<end_line>
9 millimeter heater stashed in 2 seaters with meat cleavers<end_line>
I don't blame you, I wouldn't let Hailie listen to me neither<end_line>
