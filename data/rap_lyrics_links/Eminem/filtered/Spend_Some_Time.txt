<verse_start>
If there's any bitches in this room<end_line>
Then there's something I gotta say, say<end_line>
For all the fools, who fell for the first<end_line>
girl who comes their way, way<end_line>
I've been down that road and, now I'm back<end_line>
Sittin on square one, one<end_line>
Tryin to pick myself up<end_line>
Where I started from<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I used to say I never met a girl like you before<end_line>
Still ain't got a fuckin clue as to who you truly are<end_line>
Almost went as far as introducin you to my daughters<end_line>
'til you went as far as goin and snoopin through my drawers<end_line>
Now I just feel stupid for the loop that you threw me for<end_line>
Can't believe I almost flew the coop for some stupid whore<end_line>
You used to say all you wanted was for me to be yours<end_line>
All I ever wanted from you was a few booty calls<end_line>
If you recall I used to treat you like a groupie broad<end_line>
When we fucked I refused to even take my jewelry off<end_line>
But it threw me off the first time I called and you blew me off<end_line>
It was a shock, it struck me as odd, but it turned me on<end_line>
You started gettin moody on me, pretty soon we'd argue<end_line>
And the ruder you got, the more beautiful you got to me<end_line>
And whoulda even knew that, who woulda even thought possibly<end_line>
Cupid could shoot another one of them God damned darts at me<end_line>
It's true that I got shot in the heart<end_line>
But when someone seems too good to be true, they usually are<end_line>
But see, when you're in it it's too hard to see<end_line>
'til you pull up and see some other dude's car parked and reach<end_line>
up under the seat as your heart starts to beat<end_line>
Before you make a decision that's life altering<end_line>
And just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave<end_line>
You hear them words echoing, almost haunting, that taunting ring<end_line>
<verse_end>
