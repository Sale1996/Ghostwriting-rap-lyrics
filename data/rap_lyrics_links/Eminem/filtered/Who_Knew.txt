I don't do black music, I don't do white music<end_line>
I make fight music, for high school kids<end_line>
I put lives at risk when I drive like this<end_line>
I put wives at risk with a knife like this<end_line>
Shit, you probably think I'm in your tape deck now<end_line>
I'm in the back seat of your truck, with duct tape stretched out<end_line>
Ducked the fuck way down, waitin to straight jump out<end_line>
put it over your mouth, and grab you by the face, what now?<end_line>
Oh - you want me to watch my mouth, how?<end_line>
Take my fuckin eyeballs out, and turn em around?<end_line>
Look - I'll burn your fuckin house down, circle around<end_line>
and hit the hydrant, so you can't put your burning furniture out<end_line>
I'm sorry, there must be a mix-up<end_line>
You want me to fix up lyrics while the President gets his dick sucked?<end_line>
Fuck that, take drugs, rape sluts<end_line>
Make fun of gay clubs, men who wear make-up<end_line>
Get aware, wake up, get a sense of humor<end_line>
Quit tryin to censor music, this is for your kid's amusement<end_line>
But don't blame me when lil' Eric jumps off of the terrace<end_line>
You shoulda been watchin him - apparently you ain't parents<end_line>

So who's bringin the guns in this country? <end_line>
I couldn't sneak a plastic pellet gun through customs over in London<end_line>
And last week, I seen a Schwarzaneggar movie<end_line>
where he's shootin all sorts of these motherfuckers with a uzi<end_line>
I sees three little kids, up in the front row,<end_line>
screamin "Go," with their 17-year-old Uncle<end_line>
I'm like, "Guidance - ain't they got the same moms and dads<end_line>
who got mad when I asked if they liked violence?"<end_line>
And told me that my tape taught 'em to swear<end_line>
What about the make-up you allow your 12-year-old daughter to wear?<end_line>
 So tell me that your son doesn't know any cuss words<end_line>
when his bus driver's screamin at him, fuckin him up worse<end_line>
And fuck was the first word I ever learned<end_line>
up in the third grade, flippin the gym teacher the bird<end_line>
So read up, about how I used to get beat up<end_line>
peed on, be on free lunch, and change school every 3 months<end_line>
My life's like kinda what my wife's like<end_line>
Fucked up after I beat her fuckin ass every night, Ike<end_line>
So how much easier would life be<end_line>
if 19 million motherfuckers grew to be just like me?<end_line>

Damn!  How much damage can you do with a pen?<end_line>
Man I'm just as fucked up as you woulda been<end_line>
if you woulda been, in my shoes, who woulda thought<end_line>
Slim Shady would be somethin that you woulda bought<end_line>
