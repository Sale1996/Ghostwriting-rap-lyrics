<verse_start>
Ooh wow, look at the bitches up in this club<end_line>
Man I'm gettin me some digits 'fore I leave up out this mug<end_line>
And it's like boom pow, wham bam thank you ma'am<end_line>
I ain't kissin you on the lips but I'll be glad to shake your hand<end_line>
Now let's get blew out, let's start some shit tonight<end_line>
Just let me pick the chick that I'ma leave here with tonight 'fore we get to fightin <end_line>
and threw out, this music makes me rowdy<end_line>
How they gonna play that new Trick Trick and expect no one to get their shit split?<end_line>
It's just too wild, and one more shot of Hpnotiq<end_line>
And I am not in control of my body, I go robotic<end_line>
and blow a fuse out, homies is like "He's startin to stagger"<end_line>
And I'm like naw that's just my swagger and I'm dancin with this fat girl<end_line>
and gettin loose now, I don't wanna fight, I feel like partyin<end_line>
'til this idiot dumps his Bacardi on my cardi' and <end_line>
knocks my screws out - it never fails<end_line>
I know I'm goin to jail, I might as well take the laces out my shoes now<end_line>
