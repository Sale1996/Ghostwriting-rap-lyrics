<verse_start>
I went in head-first, never thinkin about who what I said hurt<end_line>
in what verse, my mom probably got it the worst<end_line>
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are, did I take it too far?<end_line>
"Cleaning Out My Closet" and all them other songs, but regardless I don't hate you cause ma!<end_line>
You're still beautiful to me, cause you're my mom<end_line>
Though far be it from you to be calm, our house was Vietnam<end_line>
Desert Storm, and both of us put together could form an atomic bomb<end_line>
equivalent to chemical warfare, and forever we can drag this on and on<end_line>
But, agree to disagree, that gift for me up under the Christmas tree<end_line>
don't mean shit to me, you're kickin me out? It's 15 degrees<end_line>
and it's Christmas Eve, "Little prick just leave!" Ma, let me grab my fuckin coat<end_line>
Anything to have each other's goats, why we always at each other's throats?<end_line>
Especially when dad he fucked us both, we're in the same fuckin boat<end_line>
You'd think that it'd make us closefurther away it drove<end_line>
us, but together headlights shine and car full of belongings, still got a ways to go<end_line>
back to grandma's house, it's straight up the road<end_line>
And I was the man of the house, the oldest so my shoulders carried the weight of the load<end_line>
Then Nate got taken away by the state at 8 years old<end_line>
And, that's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changeable<end_line>
And to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though - but<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though<end_line>
Cause you ain't even get to witness your grand-babies grow<end_line>
But I'm sorry momma for "Cleaning Out My Closet," at the time I was angry, rightfully maybe so<end_line>
Never meant that far to take it though<end_line>
Cause, now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not makin jokes<end_line>
That song I'll no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio<end_line>
And I think of Nathan bein placed in a home<end_line>
and all the medicine you fed us and, how I just wanted you to taste your own<end_line>
But, now the medication's taken over, and your mental state's deterioratin slow<end_line>
And I'm way too old to cry, the shit is painful though<end_line>
But ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan yo<end_line>
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us BOTH<end_line>
Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours<end_line>
But I love you Debbie Mathers, oh what a tangled web we have cause<end_line>
One thing I never asked was, where the fuck my deadbeat dad was<end_line>
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keepin up with every address<end_line>
But I'da flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus<end_line>
Owned a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas<end_line>
Someone ever moved them from ME? That you coulda bet your asses<end_line>
if I had to come down the chim-i-ney dressed as Santa<end_line>
Kidnap 'em, and although one has only met their grandma<end_line>
once, you pulled up in our drive one night as we were leavin to get some hamburgers<end_line>
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you<end_line>
and as you left I had this, overwhelmin sadness<end_line>
come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths and<end_line>
I saw your headlights as I looked back and I'm mad I didn't get the chance to<end_line>
thank you for bein my mom and my dad so<end_line>
Mom please accept this as a tribute, I wrote this on the jet, I guess I had to<end_line>
get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to lay it 'fore I'm dead, the stewardess said to fasten<end_line>
my seatbelt, I guess we're crashin<end_line>
So if I'm not dreamin, I hope you get this message that I<end_line>
will always love you from afar - cause you're my ma<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I want a new lifeone without a cause<end_line>
So I'm comin home tonightwell no matter what the cost<end_line>
And if the plane goes down, or if the crew can't wake me up<end_line>
Well just know that I'm alright; I was not afraid to die<end_line>
Oh even if there's songs to sing, well my children will carry me<end_line>
Just know that I'm alright; I was not afraid to die<end_line>
Because I put my faith in my lil' girls so I'll never say, goodbye cruel world<end_line>
Just know that I'm alright; I am not afraid to diiiiiiie<end_line>
<verse_end>
