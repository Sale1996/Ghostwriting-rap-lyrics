I make music to make you sick of fake music<end_line>
Hate music like devil worshippin Satan music<end_line>
So say your prayers, your Hail Mary's and Jesuses<end_line>
Take two sticks, tape 'em together and make a crucifix<end_line>
Try to stop it but you cain't do it<end_line>
A whole generation of kids blowin out their fuckin brains to this<end_line>
Kurt Cobain music - students converted to 'caine users<end_line>
as soon as they heard it went out and murdered and maimed to it<end_line>
What's your name?<end_line>
