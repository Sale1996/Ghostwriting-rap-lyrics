Dirty Dozen is the clique so walk right over and lynch ya<end_line>
Rip the ass right out ya pants like a Doberman Pinscher<end_line>
Like the Cobra and Ninja, my intention's to injure<end_line>
And prevent ya from enterin from an inch of my center<end_line>
Or get your motherfuckin pants split at the creases<end_line>
Fuckin you intellectually;<end_line>
givin you mental sexually transmitted diseases<end_line>
My duty is to keep a stranger barred<end_line>
I guard my sector like a Saint Bernard, and this ain't the yard<end_line>
Bringin the noise like a trigger happy gun slinger<end_line>
Droppin your whole clique with one finger 'til none linger<end_line>
Beware of my dogs attackin like a pack of Great Danes<end_line>
Chargin like freight trains through the great plains<end_line>
