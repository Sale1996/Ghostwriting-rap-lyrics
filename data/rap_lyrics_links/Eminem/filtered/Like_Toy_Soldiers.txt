<verse_start>
I'm supposed to be the soldier, who never blows his composure<end_line>
Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders<end_line>
I ain't never 'sposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it<end_line>
Even if it means goin toe to toe with the Benzino<end_line>
It don't matter I'd never drag 'em in battles that I can handle<end_line>
'less I absolutely have to, I'm supposed to set an example<end_line>
I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em<end_line>
If some shit ever does pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em<end_line>
That Ja shit, I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it<end_line>
There's a certain line you just don't cross, and he crossed it<end_line>
I heard him say Hailie's name on a song, and I just lost it<end_line>
It was crazy, the shit went way beyond some Jay-Z and Nas shit<end_line>
And even though the battle is won I feel like we lost it<end_line>
I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted<end_line>
And I'm so caught in it, I almost feel I'm the one who caused it<end_line>
This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it<end_line>
That was never my object, for someone to get killed<end_line>
Why would I want to destroy somethin I helped build?<end_line>
It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good<end_line>
I went through my whole career without ever mentionin<end_line>
And that was just out of respect, for not runnin my mouth<end_line>
And talkin about somethin that I knew nothin about<end_line>
Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef<end_line>
So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth<end_line>
While he's all over TV, now I'm talkin a man<end_line>
who literally saved my life, like fuck it I understand<end_line>
This is business, and this shit just isn't none of my business<end_line>
I'm still knowin this shit could pop off at any minute, because<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
There used to be a time when, you could just say a rhyme and<end_line>
wouldn't have to worry about, one of your people dyin<end_line>
But now it's elevated, cause once you put someone's kids in it<end_line>
the shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?<end_line>
It's a different ball game, you call names and you ain't just rappin<end_line>
We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin<end_line>
Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him<end_line>
And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him<end_line>
Until Ja started yappin in magazines how he stabbed him<end_line>
Fuck him, 50 smash him, mash him and let him have it<end_line>
Meanwhile my attention's pulled in another direction<end_line>
Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk<end_line>
has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection<end_line>
Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record<end_line>
But now he's fucked the game up, cause one of the ways I came up<end_line>
was through that publication, the same one that made me famous<end_line>
Now the owner of it, has got a grudge against me for nothin?<end_line>
Well fuck it, that motherfucker could get it too, fuck him then<end_line>
But I'm so busy bein pissed off, I don't stop to think<end_line>
That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder INC<end_line>
And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind<end_line>
We still have soldiers that's on the front line<end_line>
that's willin to die for us as soon as we give the orders<end_line>
Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us<end_line>
And maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in the chorus<end_line>
To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is<end_line>
to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners<end_line>
Their loyalty to us is worth more than ANY award is<end_line>
But I ain't tryin to have none of people hurt or murdered<end_line>
It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it<end_line>
Than to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict<end_line>
I'll walk away from it all, 'fore I let it go any further<end_line>
But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin<end_line>
I'm just willin to be the bigger man if y'all can quit poppin<end_line>
off at your jaws well then I can, cause frankly I'm sick of talkin<end_line>
I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience cause<end_line>
<verse_end>
