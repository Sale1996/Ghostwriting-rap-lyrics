<verse_start>
Instinctive nature, to bring the anguishto the English language<end_line>
With this ink you haters get rode/wrote on, like a piece of paper<end_line>
This rap shit got me travellin place to place, you barely<end_line>
leave your house, cause you're always stuck at your pad, it's stationary<end_line>
Yeah, that's why when I brainstorm, gotta ride/write it out<end_line>
Simon Cowell of rhymin foul, that's why you sound<end_line>
so shook, wire-bound notebook got tied around your throat, hook it inside your mouth<end_line>
Go "hruh", that's what it's like when the mic is out<end_line>
Cause I'm tearin at your flesh with it, 'til your laryn-x and neck are split<end_line>
With these lyrics, weapons expert with, like hair extensions, extra clips<end_line>
And you're scared to effin death of it, bitch you're starin at a legend that<end_line>
in a pair of Skechers, sweatshirt ripped<end_line>
And hoodie black, should be strapped to a chair or stretcher, electric, swear on every record bitch<end_line>
Finger's so high in the air I'll bet your senses flip, like a barometric pressure switch<end_line>
... Carin less who I offend with this<end_line>
I'm at your neck like Pez dispense<end_line>
Go 'head, spit your flow bitch<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
And I'll take a hundred of you, hundred of you<end_line>
All at once like I had nothin to lose, what can I do?<end_line>
My appetite for destruction is loose, destruction is loose<end_line>
And all it wants is to have somethin to chew<end_line>
Somethin to chew, somethin to chew<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Yeah, uhh, and still conjoined at<end_line>
the hip with hop, still on point and poignant<end_line>
Skilled as Floyd is, in this field and still no filter boy<end_line>
I'll put you in your placelike a realtor boy, you still ain't in the building boy<end_line>
I will destroy shit, even as I build it, get the drill bit<end_line>
Pen is filled with poison, which is the source, easy to still pinpoint it<end_line>
Like a real thin joint itcomes on Quilted Northern<end_line>
In a built-in toilet<end_line>
Bitch, I told you I'm a dogI wouldn't heal with ointment<end_line>
Way I'm kickin these fairies tails, should write a children's storybook<end_line>
Million voices in my head but still get a little bit of, thrill, and some real enjoyment<end_line>
Off the feel of going in<end_line>
Like your bitch when she gives me BRAIN like she thinks I'm dumb<end_line>
Grabs the crown of my dick and, blows me to kingdom come<end_line>
'Til I feel anointed, she makes iller noises, when she's with me<end_line>
Must be from the Windy City huh, pretty apparent, she's a MILF when blowin me<end_line>
Cause I conned her into, rippin the condom in two, woo!<end_line>
Dick is a bargainin tool, now I'm gettin blew like Klonopins, Rude Jude<end_line>
I go there, you wouldn't? Well, I'll still have a few views<end_line>
in common with you, just not YouTube, cause<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
You're a has-been, that has been the case since back when you last went<end_line>
and threw your hat in the race, you've been trashstick your raps in the trash bin<end_line>
Or end up in my, next rhyme you're a, fuckboy so, next time<end_line>
It's gonna be heads flyin like Dez Bryant with a TEC-9 against Rex Ryan<end_line>
Now watch me set it like correct time<end_line>
All you get is sloppy seconds like a Timex, I, clock rejects into the next life<end_line>
Talkin reckless but it's just my, strongest suit but you can get my<end_line>
Columbian necktie, prostitute, just climb in the Humvee and let's ride<end_line>
Why you hitching at night? I put an end to your life, sex crime<end_line>
Kidding aside, insidious vibe, girl you know you got the prettiest eyes<end_line>
But all you're getting is bribe, ending your life to try to get you inside<end_line>
Then we gon' end up spending the night and I'm skinning your hide like an Indian tribe<end_line>
What kind of nut drives a Budweiser truck, finds a slut<end_line>
Tries to surprise her, cuffs, ties her up, binds up, cuts, slices her<end_line>
twice but the muff diver must just like it rough, fuck right in her vagina, blood<end_line>
Flies up on the visor, like a geyser, uh<end_line>
Enthusiast of the roofie, goal is to get a floozy inside the jacuzzi<end_line>
And have a loosey-goosey as Cool C is with an Uzi<end_line>
But I am to rap, what blue jeans mean to Bruce Springsteen, glued we be<end_line>
I'm truTV, you're too PG, I'm Schoolly D, you're Spoonie Gee!<end_line>
No diss there, just notice there are no similarities that we share<end_line>
Besides the fact we breathe air<end_line>
Happily married, to rap and I'm glad that we buried, the hatchet<end_line>
and patched it up, now I'm back to ratchet up my attack<end_line>
And I'm at your motherfuckin throat like<end_line>
<verse_end>
