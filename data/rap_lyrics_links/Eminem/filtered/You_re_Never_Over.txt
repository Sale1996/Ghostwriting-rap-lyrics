If Proof, could see me now, I know he'd be proud<end_line>
Somewhere in me deep down, there's somethin in me he found<end_line>
That made him believe in me, now no one can beat me now<end_line>
You try it'll be them doors, on Dre's Phantom, believe me clowns<end_line>
That means suicide homie you'll never throw me, off of this course, blow me<end_line>
Bitch I do this all for the sport only<end_line>
But I want it all, I'm not just talkin awards homie<end_line>
And the ball's in my court and it's lonely on top of the world when you're the only<end_line>
one with the balls in your shorts to leave their jaws on the floors with no re-<end_line>
-morse, 'member that when they get to doggin your boy homie<end_line>
So y'all can just get to bloggin about bolog-na<end_line>
I'm not gonna stop the saga continues, no stoppin the force Obi<end_line>
I'm moppin the floors with 'em, I keep tryin to pass it but they keep <end_line>
on droppin the torch and it won't be, long 'til the sport is O-V-<end_line>
E-R, Just Blaze and me we are knockin them doors and no we<end_line>
ain't pumpkins on Halloween but we'll show up on your porch so be<end_line>
careful what you say, there ain't no punks over here so follow me<end_line>
Through the fog like I'm S-N-double O-P, let me guide you through the smoke G<end_line>
If only I wasn't travellin down this road by my lonely<end_line>
No one who knew me like you will ever know me<end_line>
I don't think you understand how much you meant to me<end_line>

<verse_start>
For you, I wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life<end_line>
So sick it'll blow up the mic, it'll put the "dyna" in "mite"<end_line>
Yeah, it'll make the dopest MC, wanna jump off a bridge and shit himself<end_line>
Tap dancin all over the beat, it'll jump off the page and spit itself<end_line>
Guess that the best thing I can do right now Doody for you is to rep<end_line>
So I'm gonna fuck 'til I die, yeah I'ma do it to death<end_line>
And instead of mournin your death, I'd rather celebrate your life<end_line>
Elevate to new heights, step on the gas and accelerate, I'ma need two mics<end_line>
Cause the way that I'm feelin to-night, everything I can just do right<end_line>
There's nothin that I could do wrong, I'm too strong and I'm just too hype<end_line>
Just finish the rhyme and bust it - excuse the corny metaphor<end_line>
but they'll never +ketchup+, to all this energy that I've +mustard+<end_line>
So God just, help me out while I fight through this grievin process<end_line>
Tryin to process this loss is makin me nauseous<end_line>
But this depression ain't takin me hostage, I've been patiently watchin<end_line>
this game pacin these hallways; you had faith in me always<end_line>
Proof you knew I'd come out of this slump, rise from these ashes<end_line>
Come right back on they asses and go Mike Tyson on these bastards<end_line>
And I'ma show 'em, blow 'em out the water, slaughter 'em holmes<end_line>
I'ma own so many belts, only place they can hit me is below 'em<end_line>
Homie I know I'm, never gonna be the same without you<end_line>
I never would've came in this game, I'm goin insane without you<end_line>
Matter fact it was just the other night, had another dream about you<end_line>
You told me to get up, I got up, I spread my wings and I flew<end_line>
You gave me a reason to fight, I was on my way to see you<end_line>
You told me "Naw Doody you're not," layin on that table I knew<end_line>
I was gonna make it, soon as you said "Think of Hailie" I knew<end_line>
There wasn't no way that I was ever gonna leave them babies and Proof<end_line>
Not many are lucky enough to have a guardian angel like you<end_line>
Lord I'm so thankful, please don't think that I don't feel grateful, I do<end_line>
Just grant me the strength that I need, for one more day to get through<end_line>
So homie this is your song, I dedicate this to you<end_line>
I love you Doody<end_line>
