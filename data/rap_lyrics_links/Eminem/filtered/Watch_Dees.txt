<verse_start>
Who's arm is this?<end_line>
I must have cut it off of the pharmacist<end_line>
Who refused to renew my seventh presciption of darvecet<end_line>
I'm the old man who lives upstairs and starves his pets<end_line>
and never leaves his house 'cause he thinks his car's possessed<end_line>
I hate my life<end_line>
that's why I degrade my wife<end_line>
grabbed a paper plate to make a sandwich<end_line>
and just ate the knife<end_line>
my mother's screaming 'please heal him, take him straight to Christ'<end_line>
meet you on the street and slap you just to break the ice<end_line>
made a bomb threat with a fake device<end_line>
strip you naked twice, pistol whip you and force you to take advice<end_line>
and if you catch me bobbin' my head to some bullshit spittin'<end_line>
I was probably just tryin to shake the lice<end_line>
bugs fallin' out of my head<end_line>
I'm wishin' I was dead<end_line>
while I'm crawlin out of my bed<end_line>
found it red and my rash is returning<end_line>
I feel the sensation of burning<end_line>
occurring, usually during pain for release in my urine<end_line>
screamin' at my shadow 'please quit followin' me'<end_line>
these pills keep screamin' 'please quit swollin' me'<end_line>
the devil keeps screamin' 'please get down on one knee'<end_line>
took the drugs before the cops ever found them on me<end_line>
