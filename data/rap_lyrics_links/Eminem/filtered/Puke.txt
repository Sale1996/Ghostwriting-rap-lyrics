I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little poem<end_line>
But off of the dome would probably be a little more<end_line>
More suitable, for this type of song - whoa<end_line>
I got a million reasons off the top of my head that I can think of<end_line>
Sixteen bars just ain't enough to put some ink ta<end_line>
So fuck it I'ma start right here, I'll just be briefer<end_line>
Bout to rattle off some of the reasons<end_line>
I knew I shouldn't go and get another tattoo<end_line>
of you on my arm, but what do I go and do?<end_line>
I go and get another one, now I got two, ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooh<end_line>
I'm sittin here, with your name on my skin<end_line>
I can't believe I went and did this stupid shit again<end_line>
My next girlfriend, now her name's gotta be Kim, shiii-iii-iii-iit<end_line>
If you only knew, how much I hated you<end_line>
For every motherfuckin thing you've ever put us through<end_line>
Then I wouldn't be standin here cryin over you, booo-ooo-ooo-ooo-hoo<end_line>
<verse_end>

I was gonna take the time to sit down and write you a little letter<end_line>
But I thought a song would probably be a little better<end_line>
Instead of a letter, that you'd probably just shred up - yeah<end_line>
I stumbled on your picture yesterday and it made me stop and think of<end_line>
How much of a waste it'd be for me to put some ink ta<end_line>
A stupid piece'a - paper I'd rather let you see how<end_line>
much I fuckin hate you in a freestyle<end_line>
You're a fuckin cokehead slut I hope you fuckin die<end_line>
I hope you get to hell and Satan sticks a needle in your eye<end_line>
I hate your fuckin guts you fuckin slut I hope you die, die-ie-ie-ie-ie-ie-ie!<end_line>
But please don't get me wrong - I'm not bitter I'm mad<end_line>
It's not that I still love you, it's not cause I want you back<end_line>
It's just that when I think of you it makes me wanna yak, aaa-aaa-aaaak<end_line>
But when else can I do, I haven't got a clue<end_line>
Now I guess I just move on I have no choice but to<end_line>
But every time I think of you, now all I wanna do, is puuu-uuu-uuuke!<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
God damn...<end_line>
Fuckin bitch<end_line>
