I said, man...<end_line>
Damn, it feels good to be back<end_line>
I'm having a relapse<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
How the hell did he manage to get more felony charges?<end_line>
He's already got life in jail, man, what the hell is his problem?<end_line>
Well to be honest, the smell of these chronic leaves make me hella demonic<end_line>
They compel me to kill this elderly man and I get these panic attacks<end_line>
Pop a Xanax, relax<end_line>
Trying to stick my fucking dick inside a mannequin's ass<end_line>
Then I get manic depressed, see the orthodontist, get gassed; man it's kick ass<end_line>
The first thing I put on is the mask<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Speaking of masks, man, it ain't too late to have a change of pace<end_line>
And take it off and show my face, so you can see the things you face<end_line>
And slice you up and cook you after you're murdered by strangulation<end_line>
That's bacon souffle you making, ain't you?<end_line>
Well, thank you, Jason<end_line>
There goes one more coma, due to blunt force trauma<end_line>
Just give me one more soma, and I'll be done for mama<end_line>
Go in the damn, broom closet, another Valium, lost it<end_line>
Shoving the vacuum nozzle, down the bathroom faucet<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
It seems like everyday I get a little flakier<end_line>
The medication is making my hands a little shakier<end_line>
Hand me that eighteen-month-old baby to shake him up<end_line>
It'll only take me a, second to choke his trachea<end_line>
Breaking his neck in eighty-some places<end_line>
Baby, here Shady comes, lady<end_line>
He's got the razor b-blades and the ch-ch-chainsa-saw, baby<end_line>
You b-b-blundering, bumbling, m-m-mumbling dum-dums<end_line>
Yeah, here I come, come, you hear the rumbling vrumm-vrumm?<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
There's something inside of that blue tub and that drum, drum<end_line>
A head and torso of someone, where'd it come from?<end_line>
Whose it belong to? Maybe the girl with the long, blond<end_line>
Hair who disappeared and left her cheerleader pom-poms<end_line>
Clearly there's som'n wrong, 'cause she didn't come home<end_line>
She's missing; where is she? Something fishy is going on<end_line>
I guess he stuck the bitch with the pitchfork with the long prongs<end_line>
Now everybody get your dance on to my damn song<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
C'mon...<end_line>
<verse_end>
