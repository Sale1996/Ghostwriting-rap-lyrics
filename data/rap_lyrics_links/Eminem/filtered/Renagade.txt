Since I'm in a position to talk to these kids and they listen<end_line>
I ain't no politician but I'll kick it with 'em a minute<end_line>
Cause see they call me a menace; and if the shoe fits I'll wear it<end_line>
But if it don't, then y'all'll swallow the truth grin and bear it<end_line>
Now who's these king of these rude ludicrous lucrative lyrics<end_line>
Who could inherit the title, put the youth in hysterics<end_line>
Usin his music to steer it, sharin his views and his merits<end_line>
But there's a huge interference - they're sayin you shouldn't hear it<end_line>
Maybe it's hatred I spew, maybe it's food for the spirit<end_line>
Maybe it's beautiful music I made for you to just cherish<end_line>
But I'm debated disputed hated and viewed in America<end_line>
as a motherfuckin drug addict - like you didn't experiment?<end_line>
Now now, that's when you start to stare at who's in the mirror<end_line>
and see yourself as a kid again, and you get embarrased<end_line>
And I got nothin to do but make you look stupid as parents<end_line>
You fuckin do-gooders - too bad you couldn't do good at marriage!<end_line>
And do you have any clue what I had to do to get here I don't<end_line>
think you do so stay tuned and keep your ears glued to the stereo<end_line>
Cause here we go - he's<end_line>
And I'm the sinister, Mr. Kiss-My-Ass it's just the<end_line>

See I'm a poet to some, a regular modern day Shakespeare<end_line>
Jesus Christ the King of these Latter Day Saints here<end_line>
To shatter the picture in which of that as they paint me<end_line>
as a monger of hate and Satan a scatter-brained atheist<end_line>
But that ain't the case, see it's a matter of taste<end_line>
We as a people decide if Shady's as bad as they say he is<end_line>
Or is he the latter - a gateway to escape?<end_line>
Media scapegoat, who they can be mad at today<end_line>
See it's easy as cake, simple as whistlin Dixie<end_line>
while I'm wavin the pistol at sixty Christians against me<end_line>
Go to war with the Mormons, take a bath with the Catholics<end_line>
in holy water - no wonder they try to hold me under longer<end_line>
I'm a motherfuckin spiteful, DELIGHTFUL eyeful<end_line>
The new Ice Cube - motherfuckers HATE to like you<end_line>
What did I do?I'm just a kid from the gutter<end_line>
makin this butter off these bloodsuckers, cause I'm a muh'fuckin<end_line>
