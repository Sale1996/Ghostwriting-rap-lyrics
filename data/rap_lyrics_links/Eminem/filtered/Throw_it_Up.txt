And I'm stuntin like my daddy, dr-dr-dr-dr-drinkin like my momma<end_line>

Right?But I just hit the surface<end_line>
And I'm about to walk into a bank with a shank and a black can of paint and check the clerk<end_line>

And I hit the syrup, and I'm feelin like I might just hit the curb<end_line>

Hello toots, you look so eloquent, that's what I tell a cunt<end_line>
Come sit up front cause you're kickin my seat and I'm tryin to tell the cashier what I want<end_line>
They say I act like an asshole, when I pull up at the White Castle<end_line>
and I ask for an appli-cation, throw it back in their face and tell the bitch I'm a rapper<end_line>
Then I whack her in the head with a Whopper that I bought from BK, you expect me to be proper?<end_line>
