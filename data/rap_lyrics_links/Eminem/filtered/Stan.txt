My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I..<end_line>
got out of bed at all<end_line>
The morning rain clouds up my window..<end_line>
and I can't see at all<end_line>
And even if I could it'll all be gray,<end_line>
but your picture on my wall<end_line>
It reminds me, that it's not so bad,<end_line>
it's not so bad..<end_line>

Dear Slim, I wrote but you still ain't callin<end_line>
I left my cell, my pager, and my home phone at the bottom<end_line>
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not-a got 'em<end_line>
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin<end_line>
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em<end_line>
but anyways; fuck it, what's been up?  Man how's your daughter?<end_line>
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm bout to be a father<end_line>
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her?<end_line>
I'ma name her Bonnie<end_line>
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too I'm sorry<end_line>
I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him<end_line>
I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan<end_line>
I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam<end_line>
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man<end_line>
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that shit was fat<end_line>
Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back,<end_line>
just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan<end_line>
This is Stan<end_line>

Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance<end_line>
I ain't mad - I just think it's FUCKED UP you don't answer fans<end_line>
If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert<end_line>
you didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew<end_line>
That's my little brother man, he's only six years old<end_line>
We waited in the blistering cold for you,<end_line>
four hours and you just said, "No."<end_line>
That's pretty shitty man - you're like his fuckin idol<end_line>
He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do<end_line>
I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein lied to<end_line>
Remember when we met in Denver - you said if I'd write you<end_line>
you would write back - see I'm just like you in a way<end_line>
I never knew my father neither;<end_line>
he used to always cheat on my mom and beat her<end_line>
I can relate to what you're saying in your songs<end_line>
so when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on<end_line>
cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed<end_line>
I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest<end_line>
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds<end_line>
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me<end_line>
See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it<end_line>
My girlfriend's jealous cause I talk about you 24/7<end_line>
But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no one does<end_line>
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin up<end_line>
You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose<end_line>
Sincerely yours, Stan -- P.S.<end_line>
We should be together too<end_line>

Dear Mister-I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans,<end_line>
this'll be the last package I ever send your ass<end_line>
It's been six months and still no word - I don't deserve it?<end_line>
I know you got my last two letters;<end_line>
I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect<end_line>
So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it<end_line>
I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway<end_line>
Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?<end_line>
You know the song by Phil Collins, "In the Air of the Night"<end_line>
about that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning<end_line>
but didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a a show he found him?<end_line>
That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning<end_line>
Now it's too late - I'm on a 1000 downers now, I'm drowsy<end_line>
and all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call<end_line>
I hope you know I ripped +ALL+ of your pictures off the wall<end_line>
I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it<end_line>
You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it<end_line>
And when you dream I hope you can't sleep and you SCREAM about it<end_line>
I hope your conscience EATS AT YOU and you can't BREATHE without me<end_line>
See Slim;Shut up bitch!  I'm tryin to talk!<end_line>
Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin in the trunk<end_line>
but I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you<end_line>
cause if she suffocates she'll suffer more, and then she'll die too<end_line>
Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now<end_line>
Oh shit, I forgot, how'm I supposed to send this shit out?<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy<end_line>
You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?<end_line>
Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that<end_line>
and here's an autograph for your brother,<end_line>
I wrote it on the Starter cap<end_line>
I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you<end_line>
Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you<end_line>
But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?<end_line>
I say that shit just clownin dogg,<end_line>
c'mon - how fucked up is you?<end_line>
You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counseling<end_line>
to help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some<end_line>
And what's this shit about us meant to be together?<end_line>
That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other<end_line>
I really think you and your girlfriend need each other<end_line>
or maybe you just need to treat her better<end_line>
I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time<end_line>
before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin just fine<end_line>
if you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you but Stan<end_line>
why are you so mad?  Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan<end_line>
I just don't want you to do some crazy shit<end_line>
I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick<end_line>
Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge<end_line>
and had his girlfriend in the trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid<end_line>
and in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to<end_line>
Come to think about, his name was.. it was you<end_line>
