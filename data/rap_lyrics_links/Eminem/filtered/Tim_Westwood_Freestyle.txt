I wasn't born mean, I was pushed to treachery<end_line>
I walk the streets lookin' for some puss to fetch me<end_line>
I'm like a veggie, brain is turned to mush I'm edgy<end_line>
Edgy enough to give Reggie Bush a wedgie<end_line>
If he don't gimme kin, things could get messy<end_line>
So pass that ass to me let me squish the left cheek<end_line>
And press against the right one till its smushed against me<end_line>
And leave a dead body in the woods to MC with the Christopher Reeves beef<end_line>
We started out on the wrong foot, or should I say fake leg made out of wood<end_line>
I shouldn't, yes I should<end_line>
Riding through the hood, I'm chillin' with Westwood<end_line>
I'm quite mellow, a white fellow<end_line>
My pee is bright yellow, I like Jello, I'm like hello<end_line>
To a cute little dyke on the mic I'm kinda like...<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Me and Westwood blastin' off, jackin' off<end_line>
In a pair of acid washed bumpin' Asher Roth<end_line>
Cruisin' grassy 'till I damn near crash the car<end_line>
Tryna smash 'em off in the dash, hit the overpass, went off<end_line>
Over the bridge into oncoming traffic<end_line>
Cause a massive forty two car pile-up, not a scratch at all<end_line>
Hopped up holdin' a axe and saw<end_line>
Jason mask is off when my face is plastered in tobasco sauce<end_line>
Spittin' flames, kickin' fire out ur ass you little -<end_line>
You can pass it on, I'm battery acid dog<end_line>
You don't wanna get my ass ticked off<end_line>
I'm harder than playing basketball when I'm going through crack withdrawal<end_line>
Dick so big it's like elastic, I tie it in a knot and it looks like Mr. Fantastic<end_line>
Crossed the path of Plastic man with a drastic force...Put my penis on classic sports<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Once again it's the sinister, cynical, minister Shady<end_line>
Kryptonite the Superman, he's a Dennis to Amy<end_line>
Administer of the pain, just finish, cover the paint<end_line>
And muffle the fumes like it was nothin' because it ain't<end_line>
Anything in his way, his enemies he just slays<end_line>
His venom he spray reaches like beads of energy rays<end_line>
Menacing stares, he glares making the hairs all on the back of yah neck stand<end_line>
Like dracula yep, spectacular rep, he's a tarantula, gargantuan<end_line>
Yah, Angela so I command yah to start dancin'<end_line>
Part Manson, part Hannibal, part mechanical<end_line>
Sharp,throwing animal parts at Scarlett Johansen<end_line>
Enter my gas chamber, yah gangsta? My ass<end_line>
He's got his fangs to your neck, he's set to strangle ya ass, hater<end_line>
You're facin' a task greater, he's chasin' your ass<end_line>
He's got his face in a mask, your blood stains on his glass table<end_line>
I'm checking the exposure, a full dose of me<end_line>
exposing myself locked inside of a cozy hotel posing<end_line>
With or without clothing, next to the decomposing<end_line>
bodies eroding while I'm dozing off overdosing<end_line>
Windows opening-shutting, doors opening-closing I think there's a ghost<end_line>
Too much hydrocordone on coating<end_line>
I was only 'sposed to swallow a half, I took the whole thing<end_line>
I'm not joking, I think I just snorted my nose ring<end_line>
I need a drink, I'm standing over the sink posing<end_line>
Myself, self-loathing, cause I'm on a brink, postally<end_line>
I don't wanna think this will make everything rosy<end_line>
Beverly sings, scream while I'm severing three toesies<end_line>
Totally frozen while I close in, I'm yodelling "Rosey, won't you come out to play?"<end_line>
A nuisance, wasting time, cutting and pasting headlines in the papers<end_line>
Making shrines of my crimes and capers<end_line>
My words are whirlwinds, I murder my girlfriends<end_line>
Go to Europe and put nervines in my syrop and stirred 'em<end_line>
You never heard 'em like this, so don't encourage him<end_line>
The neurosurgeon, coke mirrors, I'm lyrics worse than<end_line>
The kinda person to get Katie Couric to cursin'<end_line>
Eighty spirits of ladies cause Shady murdered the virgins<end_line>
Crazy, turn him, convinced that he emerged, took over the world<end_line>
And reeled in all the children, lured 'em into the building and killed 'em<end_line>
Buried 'em in the mulch and mildew and he will do what he feels <end_line>
And still can spit, drawn to gold like Rumplestilskin<end_line>
Cotton to silk, Motrin to Tylenol 3 pills, the Real Slim Shady's entered the buildin'<end_line>
There's nothing but crumbled leaves and tumbleweeds up in this bitch, Mildrid<end_line>
He's ill wit it, he still shouldn't be heeled<end_line>
There's no one as sick as he MC's will get freakasied on the grill then<end_line>
<verse_end>

You wanna start with the hook first?<end_line>
You wanna start with the..? Oh..<end_line>
I have no idea what I'm doing, I have no idea what I'm doing, but<end_line>
Everybody get up, sit up, Christopher<end_line>
They're miserable without you, Superman is a-<end_line>
Live and he's flowin like the Mystic River<end_line>
Girl don't act like you've never been kissed before<end_line>
One, two, three, four<end_line>
Five, six, this uh<end_line>
Rhyme is about to hit you right in the kisser<end_line>
How did anybody ever find me I disa-<end_line>
Peared I was hiding in Freeway's beard, just a<end_line>
Hop, skip and a jump from  my skin, gushin'<end_line>
Nails into my face that I been pushin'<end_line>
Hellraiser, my face is my pincushion<end_line>
It's like when I'm on the mic I can squish a<end_line>
Sucka like a vicegrip, my pin put ya<end_line>
In the slaughterhouse cause your style's been butchered<end_line>
I'll spin chainsaw, take off like the blades on, my brains on<end_line>
Hyperdrive, someone put the breaks on<end_line>
<verse_end>

Here's a smidget, a midget to get your digits, Bridget<end_line>

...Cause he gets as busy as a<end_line>
Bee baby you could throw a frisbee in a blizzard<end_line>
He'll catch it in his teeth, what is he? He's a wizard<end_line>
Standing in the disco with a disco biscuit<end_line>
And I'm pretty sure it isn't biscwit, is it?<end_line>
Now baby don't forget to bring your lipstick with ya<end_line>
I want the kiss before I blow this bitch to smitha-<end_line>
Reens, get the guillotines, this is a situ-<end_line>
Ation that's critical as Dre spins his, uh<end_line>
Turn tables and he cuts the record like a scissor<end_line>
Checka-chicky-checka-chicky-checka-checka-chicka<end_line>
Who wreck it in a second tell me what the heck is sicker<end_line>
Wait a minute I just dropped my necklace in the liquor<end_line>
Now baby just to make a little breakfast and it's six o-<end_line>
Clock in the morning unless you want to get some dessert<end_line>

Ayo, just so everybody knows...<end_line>
That was a hook we made on the way to the radio station<end_line>
And we were trying to get it right<end_line>
so we may have fucked it up a couple times or whatever<end_line>
But, this is what we were trying to like work out before we came here<end_line>
Especially for Westwood, man! ESPECIALLY for you homie!<end_line>
