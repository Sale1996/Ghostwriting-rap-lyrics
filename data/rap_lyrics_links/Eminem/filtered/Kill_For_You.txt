In your dream, you're drownin, I just waltz in and save you<end_line>
I'm your alternate escape route, the altar you pray to<end_line>
Your ultimate savior - your behavior is altered<end_line>
Ain't your fault cause I made you, brainwash and persuade you<end_line>
Gibraltar, your faith'll, never falter or waver<end_line>
One you call to in danger, I'm your guardian angel<end_line>
Nobody can tell you, shit you've already made your<end_line>
mind, just follow me babe you, won't be sorry you stayed, you<end_line>
always ride, whatever the plan is<end_line>
'Til the end, even if I led us into an ambush<end_line>
Even if we robbed a First National<end_line>
And cops caught us red-handed<end_line>
they're comin at us and we're trapped with our backs up<end_line>
against the wall and it's too tall, you'd catapult me<end_line>
or hold the ladder for me, stay back to get captured<end_line>
Take the fall, you make it all worth it, baby doll<end_line>
You're perfect, the way you are - accidents happen!<end_line>
All I know is you love me, that's really all that matters<end_line>
And any who cross our paths are just collateral damage<end_line>
At your side, got your lateral, back, your front, diagonal<end_line>
Backwards, blackbirds, we attack like animals<end_line>
When they threaten what we have it's a natural reaction<end_line>
You'll lay a bitch flat on her back in<end_line>
a second flat for me<end_line>
Who tries to take your man from you, it's blasphemy, another casualty<end_line>
You'll go whatever route!<end_line>
Do whatever you have to do, you'd blast for me, I never doubt - that!<end_line>
