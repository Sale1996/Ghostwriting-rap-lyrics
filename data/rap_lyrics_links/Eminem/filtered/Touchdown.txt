Welcome to the Midwest, yes<end_line>
Where them Detroit playas ball like you have no idea<end_line>
The boy is here, got the whole place looking like it's candy painted<end_line>
Ain't it like we left the kids at home and just let em loose with the crayons<end_line>
Fuck, I just hit a jogger, people looking like Frogger<end_line>
They hopping out of the way whenever they see Marshall's car coming<end_line>
The kids painted my windows with black permanent marker<end_line>
And let the rest of the car carpet color like swirl pops<end_line>
And I got the bass thumping but I'm bound to bump into something<end_line>
Kids are flying through the air looking like they krumping<end_line>
The way they tumbling, I gotta do something<end_line>
But as soon as I hit the car wash to get the tar off<end_line>
They just right back at it tommorrow<end_line>
They're like, "Dad this is in, so you're with the trends"<end_line>
"This is for the pimps, listening to mens, nail polish on the rims"<end_line>
And now it's custom chrome, but I gotta go do a show<end_line>
So go on with ya bad self, just have it back to normal when I touch down<end_line>
