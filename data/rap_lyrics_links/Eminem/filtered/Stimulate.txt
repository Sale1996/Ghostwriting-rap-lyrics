<verse_start>
My lyrical content is constantly under fire, no wonder why<end_line>
Constantly bombed back to combat attacks to constant concepts<end_line>
When lyrics are constantly took out of context<end_line>
Failure to communicate with Congress has<end_line>
Been a problem for the longest I guess but<end_line>
Maybe one day we can make some progress<end_line>
Food for thought see how long it takes to digest<end_line>
Feelin' good when I should be ashamed<end_line>
Shit I really shoulda fell but I stood, see I came<end_line>
Like a flame in the night, like a ghost in the dark<end_line>
There's a ray, there's a light, there's a hope, there's a spark<end_line>
But when planets collide they'll never see eye-to-eye<end_line>
Until they decide to set their differences aside<end_line>
And this is why only one of us will survive<end_line>
So children, follow my lead and feel the vibe because<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
My music can be slightly amusin'<end_line>
You shouldn't take lyrics so serious it might be confusin'<end_line>
Tryin' to separate the truth from entertainment<end_line>
It's stupid ain't it? I get sick just tryin' to explain it<end_line>
See I could sit and argue wit' you but it goes beyond<end_line>
Just bein' a snot, pointy-nosed, bleach blonde<end_line>
'Cuz I came here to uplift, let your woes be gone<end_line>
Tell 'em to get fucked and just mosey on<end_line>
Constantly movin', constantly usin'<end_line>
The Constitution as a form of restitution<end_line>
Bless the children, nothin' less than brilliant<end_line>
"Let Me Entertain You" like Robbie Williams<end_line>
I'll be here when y'all are gone rebuildin'<end_line>
World revolvin', still evolvin', still Slim<end_line>
How many kids'll copy? Probably millions<end_line>
But I'ma do this as a fuckin' hobby 'til then 'cuz<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
My lyrical content contains subject matter that sucks up all these fucked up<end_line>
Young kids at an alarmin' rate, common denominate<end_line>
Add it up, and you see just why I dominate<end_line>
I try to stimulate but kids emulate<end_line>
and mimic every move you make, Slim, you great!<end_line>
But wait, can't you see I'm only hear to entertain?<end_line>
I gotta be the one to go against the grain<end_line>
'Cuz now I see it, feel it, live it but it's inhumane<end_line>
For me to see you be influenced then pretend you ain't<end_line>
But they don't understand that I been through pain<end_line>
If you get to know me I can be a friend you gain<end_line>
But you can't just stand there and try to judge<end_line>
It hurts but your jealousy prolly tears you up inside as much<end_line>
And as such, I pleasure every button that I touch<end_line>
I treasure every glutton that I punish in my lust but<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
(I'm here to save you<end_line>
I've come here for the ride<end_line>
So let me entertain you<end_line>
And everything will be fine)<end_line>
<verse_end>
