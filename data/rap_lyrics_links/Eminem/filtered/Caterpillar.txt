You're lookin at Attila, the psychopathic killer, the caterpillar<end_line>
Don't tell me when I'm supposed to rap until e-<end_line>
-specially when your favorite rapper ain't even half as ill, a<end_line>
savage still, the track's a banana peel, attack of the silverback gorilla<end_line>
You're havin a little trouble fathomin<end_line>
this is actually happenin like Anderson Silva back when he<end_line>
snapped his shin in half and then had the shit hangin by a flap of skin<end_line>
after he tried to plant the shit back on the mat again<end_line>
Pad to pen I'm batty like eyelids when they're blinkin a lot<end_line>
You copy me but you're not<end_line>
You can't be butterflies, my offsprings are just moths<end_line>
I see that thing I'ma squash it and rip the wings of it off<end_line>
So ring the alarm, pull the extinguishers off<end_line>
the walls, set the sprinklers off<end_line>
Like Jada Pinkett and Queen Latifah 'til the shingles come off<end_line>
the roof, we'll shout at the ceiling, Slaughterhouse in the building, middle fingers a-loft!<end_line>
Say what I think when I rhyme<end_line>
In ink-pen I talk and the language I speak is my mind, Kingpin and Penguin combined<end_line>
Spit like it's King of the Dot, a singular thought<end_line>
I think of will help you distinguish apart the frauds from the cream of the crop<end_line>
Like a flashcard, damn dawg<end_line>
Is that copyin or payin homage?<end_line>
It's sad because dad taught you to rap as a damn toddler<end_line>
My dad is your grandfather, I'll have to re-hatch on ya<end_line>
Come back as a black wasp, half yellow jacket you can't swat, a<end_line>
Sasquatch dancin on top of an ant<end_line>
Trample it and stomp it, smash it and stand on it<end_line>
Damnit I can't stop it<end_line>
The rap is a vag' and I'm goin in like a tampon in this bitch, it's a manslaughter<end_line>
Stampin out grasshoppers, you can't be no +Rap Gods+<end_line>
In fact you're exact opposites, you make a wack song/wax on<end_line>
And can't hold a candle but even Daniel-san wax/whacks off<end_line>
You jack-offs, need to cum/come to grips like a handjob<end_line>
... The boom bap is comin back<end_line>
with an axe to mumble rap; lumberjack with a hacksaw!<end_line>
Number one, but my pencils are number twos<end_line>
Cause that's all I do's with 'em, poop is my pseudonym<end_line>
On the john like a prostitute when I'm droppin a deuce and when I'm producin<end_line>
them lyrical bowel movements these beats are like my saloons<end_line>
Cause these bars always got my stools in 'em<end_line>
And I don't need Metamucil to loosen 'em<end_line>
Bitch, shit +Is-real+ like I pooped Jerusalem<end_line>
I'm 'bout to go spin another cocoon then I'm cuttin you from your mother's womb<end_line>
then I'm flushin you!<end_line>
