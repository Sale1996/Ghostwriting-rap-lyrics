<verse_start>
It's only fair to warn, I was born with a set of horns<end_line>
And metaphors attached to my dang umbilical cord<end_line>
Warlord of rap that'll bash you with a two by four<end_line>
And smash into your Honda Accord with a four door Ford<end_line>
But I'm more toward droppin' an acapella<end_line>
To chop a fella to mozzarella worse than a helicopter propeller<end_line>
Got chu' locked in a cellar with your skeleton showin'<end_line>
Developin' anorexia while I'm standin' next to ya<end_line>
Eatin' a four-course meal watchin' you starve to death<end_line>
Put a IV in ya vein feedin' ya liquid Darvaset<end_line>
Pumpin' you full of drugs<end_line>
Pull the plugs on a gunshot victim full of bullet slugs<end_line>
Who were picked up by an ambulance and driven to receiving<end_line>
With they asses ripped out of they pants<end_line>
And given a less than twenty percent chance of livin'<end_line>
Havin' a possible placement as a hospital patient<end_line>
Storin' the dead bodies in grandma's lil' basement<end_line>
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived to perform an autopsy<end_line>
On you while you scream "I'm still alive"<end_line>
Drivin' a rusty scalpel through the top of ya scalp<end_line>
I'm pullin' ya Adam's apple out through ya mouth<end_line>
Better call the fire department, I've hired an arsonist<end_line>
To set fire to carpet and burn up your entire apartment<end_line>
