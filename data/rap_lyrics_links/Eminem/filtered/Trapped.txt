My life is trapped in these line's, that's why I'm packin these nine's<end_line>
I gotta rap I ain't dyin', that's in the back of my mind<end_line>
Got a strap made of iron, can't relax on his grind<end_line>
Bendin' over backwards for these slackers, 'til I'm snappin' my spine<end_line>
Natural high, gotta focus, on these bogus poachers<end_line>
Lookin' over my shoulder, Proof get it poppin' like soda, hold up<end_line>
Slow up<end_line>
Roll up<end_line>
If Em say it, I spray it, if he will it, I kill it<end_line>
We kill packs to get iller in Detroit, hope y'all can feel it<end_line>
Real as this gun on my waistline, and woah we don't waste time<end_line>
mad he can't take a punch and 50 can take nine<end_line>
We got school craft here at the 7, 8, and text her<end_line>
I'm up in Holly, spendin' dollas, ain't feelin' no pressure<end_line>
Yes sir, your texture is bitch, betcha' you flinch<end_line>
When Proof shoot up they coupe, and waste your whole clique<end_line>
