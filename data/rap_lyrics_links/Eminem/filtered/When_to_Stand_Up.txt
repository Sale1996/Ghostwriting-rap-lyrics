At birth I was born with the biggest middle finger on earth<end_line>
The first time I went to stick it up the shit hurt<end_line>
Mom wouldn't take me, the bitch still hates me<end_line>
One day she said, "Go rake leaves," I said, "Make me!"<end_line>
I'm proud to announce i was probably the first kid<end_line>
Who was kicked out of his house for making fart sounds with his mouth<end_line>
Arguing with me and mom was on-going<end_line>
She called law enforcement when I broke the law mower<end_line>
The slut gave me a truck when I turned sixteen<end_line>
I went to start it and it screamed, "Please fix me!"<end_line>
Back then, when Will Smith was still the Fresh Prince<end_line>
And him and Jeff were still best friends, I guess then<end_line>
I decided to cut class to rap full time<end_line>
And get the fuck outta this fake shit school and rhyme<end_line>
Anybody who thinks this fuckin attitude is a gimmick<end_line>
Come and see me, see if I don't live up to this image<end_line>
Break shit!<end_line>

<verse_start>
I came to my last show with a horse swingin' a lasso<end_line>
Drunk with the asshole ripped out of an old bathrobe<end_line>
Cause I don't give a fuck, you better understand that<end_line>
Two Zantacs, I don't give a fuck where SoundScan at<end_line>
Billboard, drugs is what I kill for<end_line>
I'm Happy Gilmore, just slip me anything in pill form<end_line>
I may mingle but I plan to stay single<end_line>
Play bingo and drink, get old and watch my face wrinkle<end_line>
Sike, I'm 24 Thursday; six more birthdays <end_line>
and I'm blowin my brains out when I'm thirty<end_line>
As long as my heart beats I'ma keep tryin to see<end_line>
How much speed I can eat before I fall the fuck asleep<end_line>
So "I'm the Rapper, He's the DJ"<end_line>
I'm the one thats got the six year old nephew screamin "F/U/C/K"<end_line>
So Jeff, give me a scratch<end_line>
The rest of y'all can kiss my ass 'til your lips stick to my pants<end_line>
