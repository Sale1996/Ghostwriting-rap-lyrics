<verse_start>
We were so young <end_line>
So full of life and vibrance <end_line>
Side by side, wherever you was riding, I went<end_line>
So close, almost on some bonnie and clyde shit<end_line>
When Ronnie died you was right by my side <end_line>
With a shoulder to cry on and tissue to wipe my eyes <end_line>
And a bucket to catch ever tear I cried inside it <end_line>
You even had the same type of childhood I did <end_line>
Sometimes I just wanna know why is it that you succaim to yours <end_line>
And mine I survived it. You ran the streets, I 9 to 5ed it <end_line>
We grew up, grew apart as time went by us <end_line>
And I blew up to both yours and mines surprises<end_line>
Now I feel a vibe I just cant describe it<end_line>
Much as your pride tries to hide it<end_line>
Your cold your touch is just like ice <end_line>
And your eyes is a look of resentment<end_line>
I can sense it and I don't like it<end_line>
