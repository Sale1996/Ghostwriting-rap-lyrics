<verse_start>
There they go<end_line>
Packin stadiums as Shady spits his flow<end_line>
Nuts they go<end_line>
Macadamian, they go so ballistic, whoa<end_line>
He can make them look like bozo's<end_line>
He's wonderin if he should spit this slow<end_line>
FUCK NO, go for broke<end_line>
This cup just runneth over, almost<end_line>
He ain't had a reproach like this<end_line>
Since the last time that he overdosed<end_line>
They been waitin patiently for Pinnochio to poke his nose<end_line>
Back into the game and they kno<end_line>
Rap will never be same as before<end_line>
Bashin in the brains of these hoes<end_line>
And establishin the name as he goes<end_line>
The passion in the flame is ignited<end_line>
You can't put it out once we light it<end_line>
This shit is exactly what the fuck<end_line>
That im talkin about when we riot<end_line>
You dealin wit a few true villains<end_line>
Who stand inside of a booth, truth spillin<end_line>
And spit true feelins until our truth feelins<end_line>
Come flyin up outta our mouth, now rewind it<end_line>
Pay back motherfucker for the way that you got at me, how's it taste? <end_line>
When I slap the taste outta ya mouth<end_line>
Wit the bass so loud that it shakes the place<end_line>
I'm Hannibal Lector so just in case you're thinkin of saving face<end_line>
You ain't gon have no face to save by the time I'm thru with this place, so Drake<end_line>
