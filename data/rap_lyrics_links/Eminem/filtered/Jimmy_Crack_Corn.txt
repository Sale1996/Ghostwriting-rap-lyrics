Jimmy can crack corn but I don't care<end_line>
My enemies crack corn but I don't care<end_line>
You can be black white or albino yeah<end_line>
You can have cornrows inside your hair<end_line>
I give a fuck if I don't like your stare<end_line>
This bottle of wine goes upside your head<end_line>
A little bit psycho but I know that<end_line>
Think you just don't say it and I won't say it<end_line>
See if you don't brag then I don't brag<end_line>

Cuz you know that somewhere inside those layers<end_line>
The rattlesnakes right there to bite your ass<end_line>

You jealous little fucks beg for my attention but<end_line>
I done told you once I'm not the kind of attention you want<end_line>
If I tell you twice then I won't be so nice<end_line>
If you keep coming back that only means you know you lost the fight<end_line>
They wanna talk shit let them talk shit cuz they talk shit<end_line>
Knowing deep down they really just wanna squash it<end_line>
Cuz no one wants to walk around steppining dog shit<end_line>
And get doo doo on their shoe again as soon as they wash it<end_line>
But the pride won't let em inside they like go get em<end_line>
And I'm just like why you trying to fight momentum<end_line>
We just keep winning by landslides oh an um<end_line>
