I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek<end_line>
Oh well, guess beggers can't be choosy<end_line>
Wanted to receive attention for my music<end_line>
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me<end_line>
for wantin my cake and eat it too, and wantin it both ways<end_line>
Fame made me a balloon, cause my ego inflated when I blew, see<end_line>
But it was confusing, cause all I wanted to do's be<end_line>
the Bruce Lee, of loose leaf<end_line>
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam<end_line>
WOO! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee<end_line>
But with what I gave up to get, it was bittersweet<end_line>
It was like winnin a used mink<end_line>
Ironic cause I think I'm gettin so huge I need a shrink<end_line>
I'm beginnin to lose sleep - one sheep, two sheep<end_line>
Goin cuckoo and kooky as Kool Keith<end_line>
But I'm actually weirder than you think<end_line>
Cause I'm<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Now I ain't much of a poet<end_line>
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment and don't squander it<end_line>
Cause you never know when it could all be over tomorrow so I keep conjurin<end_line>
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from<end_line>
"Yeah ponderin'll do you wonders<end_line>
No wonder you're losin your mind the way it wanders"<end_line>
Yodelodaley-hee-hoo! I think it went wanderin<end_line>
off down yonder and stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen!<end_line>
Cause I need an interventionist<end_line>
to intervene between me and this monster<end_line>
And save me from myself, and all this conflict<end_line>
Cause the very thing that I love's killin me and I can't conquer it<end_line>
My OCD's conkin me in the head, keep knockin<end_line>
Nobody's home, I'm sleep-walkin<end_line>
I'm just relayin what the voice in my head's sayin, don't shoot the messenger<end_line>
I'm just friends with the<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Call me crazy but I have this vision<end_line>
one day that, I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian<end_line>
But until then drums get killed and I'm <end_line>
comin straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and I'll<end_line>
take you back to the days that, I get on a Dre track<end_line>
Give every kid who got played that, pumped up feelin<end_line>
and shit to say back, to the kids who played 'em<end_line>
I ain't here to save the fuckin children<end_line>
But if one kid, out of a hundred million<end_line>
who are goin through a struggle feels it and relates, that's<end_line>
great! It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin way back<end_line>
in the draft, turn nothin into somethin, still can make that<end_line>
straw into gold chump I will spin<end_line>
Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack!<end_line>
Maybe I need a straitjacket, face facts<end_line>
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that!<end_line>
It's nothin, I'm still friends with the<end_line>
<verse_end>
