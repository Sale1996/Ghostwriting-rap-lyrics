<verse_start>
Me and Pace had to flee in haste from bein' chased<end_line>
For some E & Js we boosted out of some Korean place	<end_line>
I get drunk and hang-glide off of St. Ides'<end_line>
And spray-paint the plain sides of all the subway train rides<end_line>
I got a pitbull that eats sheep and spits wool<end_line>
And chews on human body tissue 'til its stomach gets full<end_line>
Skip school, barely went to class, thinkin' shit's cool<end_line>
Hid a loaded pistol under this retarded kid's stool<end_line>
I had a dream I blew up with half a mil' sold<end_line>
And still stole a credit card, a purse, and someone's billfold<end_line>
I'm from the city where the weather's always real cold<end_line>
And chill mode can turn into somebody gettin' steel-toed<end_line>
We be hangin' on the block 'til dawn<end_line>
Stayin' spaced out like Dr. Octagon<end_line>
Feelin' for the beats like they Chaka Khan<end_line>
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa<end_line>
Pace Won, Slang Ton, and Yah<end_line>
Young Zee, Az-Izz, D.U., and muah<end_line>
Bizarre Kid, Loon One and Rah<end_line>
Mama-se, Mama-sa, Mama-macosa<end_line>
