Hi kids!  Do you like Primus? <end_line>
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids? <end_line>
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did?<end_line>
Tryand get messed up worse that my life is?<end_line>
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin to get my head straight<end_line>
but I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to<end_line>
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady you a basehead!"<end_line>
Uh-uhhh!  "So why's your face red?  Man you wasted!"<end_line>
Well since age twelve, I've felt like a caged elf<end_line>
who stayed to himself, in one space, chasin his tail<end_line>
Got ticked off and ripped Pamela Lee's lips off<end_line>
Kissed em and said, "I ain't know silicone was 'sposed to be this soft"<end_line>
I'm bout to pass out and crash, and fall in the grass<end_line>
faster than a fat man who sat down too fast<end_line>
C'mere lady! <end_line>
I don't give a damn, Dre sent me to tick the world off!<end_line>

My English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high <end_line>
Thanks a lot.. next semester, I'll be thirty-five<end_line>
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler<end_line>
and told him to change the grade on the paper <end_line>
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up<end_line>
Served the bartender, then walked out with a tip cup<end_line>
Extraterrestrial, runnin over pedestrians<end_line>
in a spaceship while they're screamin at me: "LET'S JUST BE FRIENDS!"<end_line>
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to<end_line>
I just found out my mom does morethan I do<end_line>
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper<end_line>
Make a record about doinand name it after her <end_line>
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands<end_line>
and try to touch your hands like some screamin Usher fans <end_line>
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph <end_line>
So I signed it: 'Dear Dave, thanks for the support,'<end_line>
<verse_end>

Stop the tape!  This kid needs to be locked away! <end_line>
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, OPERATE!<end_line>
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die<end_line>
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive<end_line>
Am I comin or goin?  I can barely decide<end_line>
I just drank a fifth of Kool-Aid -- dare me to drive? <end_line>
All my life I was very deprived<end_line>
I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide<end_line>
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk <end_line>
I spit when I talk, I'llanything that walks <end_line>
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits<end_line>
HOW YOU GONNA BREAST FEED ME MOM?  YOU AIN'T GOT NO<end_line>
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed <end_line>
Put a bulleproof vest on and tap myself in the head <end_line>
I'm steamin mad <end_line>
And by the way when you see my dad? <end_line>
Ask him if he bought a porno mag and seen my ad<end_line>
