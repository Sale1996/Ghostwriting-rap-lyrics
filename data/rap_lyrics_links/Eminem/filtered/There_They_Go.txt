<verse_start>
Meat cleaver, leave a gas in a bitches ass<end_line>
See her dreams of being an R&B singer diva<end_line>
Leave her face, cut her from the waist<end_line>
Ah man what a waste, of a pretty face<end_line>
And this place ain't just safe, it's just straight gangsta<end_line>
It ain't just New York or L.A. that pains no more<end_line>
There's Latin Coun' Kings here<end_line>
Southside, four, East Side and Gansen<end_line>
Nuthin but ganglands and, spray paint cans<end_line>
And when that van rolls up, man they ain't glancing<end_line>
That window rolls down and that tre-eight's dancing<end_line>
And them shooters don't miss, homie they hate chancing<end_line>
Straight for the dome and it's vacate fast and<end_line>
Get the fuck outta dodge 'fore that blue Dodge flashing<end_line>
Red and blue lights, no ambulance, you got flattened<end_line>
And this was not supposed to be no Detroit anthem<end_line>
But just so ya know, if ya see them D-Boys passing<end_line>
