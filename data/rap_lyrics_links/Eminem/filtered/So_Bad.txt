I'm the American dream! I'm the definition of white trash balling<end_line>
I'm right back on 'em, with the<end_line>
I can't call it<end_line>
Same shit, different toilet, oh you got a nice ass darlin'!<end_line>
Can't wait to get you into my Benz, take you for a spin<end_line>
What you mean we aint fuckin', you take me for a friend?<end_line>
Let me tell you the whole story of Shady's origin<end_line>
You'll be sorry if you slam my Mercedes door again!<end_line>
Now, it all started with my father<end_line>
I must have got my pimping genes from him, the way he left my mama<end_line>
I'm a rolling stone just like him, word to Johnny Trauma<end_line>
Keep my entourage with me, baby i'll make a promise<end_line>
There aint nobody as bomb as, me I'm as calm as<end_line>
The breeze, I'm the bees knees, his legs and his arms I'm a<end_line>
S-superstar, girl, I'm ready for you mama!<end_line>
Why you think the only thing I got on is my pyjamas?<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I'm equivalent to a shot of Cuervo, first I kiss your navel<end_line>
Work my way down, baby you can lay down on the table<end_line>
But you may wanna find something more stable<end_line>
I told you I aint fooling from the gate, this aint the first day of april!<end_line>
But thank you for staying April, I'ma make you learn<end_line>
To appreciate me, differentiate me<end_line>
From these phoney, little fishy and sissy fake G's<end_line>
Skip over the huggy-bear and all the kissyface, please<end_line>
Initiate phase three! Missy now service me<end_line>
Take another shot of Jager, shake it so nervously<end_line>
Take your time baby, ooh you're the bomb baby!<end_line>
Ooh you're doing that even better than your mom lady!<end_line>
I told you I'm Shady, you didn't listen now, did you?<end_line>
Relax woman, you know that I'm only kidding with you<end_line>
Got a twisted sense of humour, it's warped, but I didn't hit you<end_line>
I think you're finally starting to get the picture, I'm...<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I got you caught up in the rapture<end_line>
Make you recapture the feelings you had for your last boyfriend before he slapped you<end_line>
You never wanted someone so bad you're sweating<end_line>
But if I'm what you wanted, why'd you panic when I grabbed you?<end_line>
Girl don't be so frantic I'm just a hopeless romantic<end_line>
Don't try to fight the feeling of something that's organic<end_line>
You can't ignore it, so don't just stand before it<end_line>
Just drop them panties to the floor, let's get to camcordin'<end_line>
Damn shorty, I told you this was bound to happen<end_line>
Soon as you wrote your number on a napkin I was bound to work a number on your back and<end_line>
Throw your spine out of alignment<end_line>
My love has got you so blinded you couldn't pick Amy Winehouse out of a lineup<end_line>
So stop with the snoring, pick your pint up<end_line>
Let's get the pineapple schnapps going, no one'll knock cause I'ma hang a sign up<end_line>
Saying "Don't Disturb", shorty I'm so superb<end_line>
I say the right things, don't I spit the dopest words?<end_line>
<verse_end>

Light years ahead of you..haha...<end_line>
