Like a verbal seduction when<end_line>
Seduction when I tell her...Girls on the shore<end_line>
Girl, Girl, Girl...Right Now...Girls on the shore<end_line>
Girl, Girl, Girl...Like a verbal seduction when...Girls on the shore<end_line>
Girls on the shore...<end_line>

<verse_start>
I feel like I'm morphin'<end_line>
Into something that's so incredible that I'm dwarfin'<end_line>
All competitors<end_line>
Better get your girlfriend in check<end_line>
It's psychological warfare<end_line>
Endorphines I affect<end_line>
Your self-esteem shatters his dialect<end_line>
Comes blastin out ya deck, she loves me<end_line>
Such passion you'd expect<end_line>
This sort of reaction, from her yet<end_line>
You're stronger, you're fuck'n corny<end_line>
You try to turn...your charm on<end_line>
Cuz you just think you're 'bishop the Don Juan<end_line>
But if you think you're fucking with me, homie you're on one<end_line>
I'm cock'n my head back like Ed Lover, come on son<end_line>
She's on my Johnson, she brings my name up constant<end_line>
You're boys are like, "She's fuck'n with dude, she wants 'em"<end_line>
Oh boy, you better get a clue<end_line>
She's on my dick cuz I spit better than you<end_line>
What you expect her to do?<end_line>
How you expect her to act in the sack?<end_line>
When she's close'n her eyes<end_line>
Fantasizing her diggn' her nails in my back to this track<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
She's sitting there gettin' liquored up at the bar<end_line>
She says it's quicker to count the things that ain't wrong with you<end_line>
Than to count the things that are<end_line>
There's a 7 disc CD changer in the car<end_line>
And I'm in every single slot, and you're not<end_line>
I'm the logo on that Dallas Cowboy helmet<end_line>
And I'm not about to sit back and just keep rhym'n one syllable<end_line>
Switch it up, and watch them haters not give it up<end_line>
Cuz they just not good enough, but I'm not givin up<end_line>
Til I get my respect, and I won't stop til I get enough<end_line>
Cuz I'm not livin up to my own expectations<end_line>
That hater alarm is sound'n, ah, but Obama took the bomb from my name<end_line>
So quit crying that I took your dame homie, she my dame<end_line>
You're sadly mistaken if you think'n that I'm not on my game boy<end_line>
And thangs, just ain't been the same since the day that I came forth<end_line>
You wear your heart on your sleeve, I sport that white tank boy<end_line>
But you got a hard-on for me, what you holler'n my name for<end_line>
It's your bitch on my dick, ain't my dang fault, man I can't call it<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
It's like we're playin'n lyrical tug of war with your ear<end_line>
You hear it, girl come here, put your ear up to the speaker<end_line>
Dear, while I freak this...world premier<end_line>
Seducin' her, loosen' up with a little freestyle, what-wa wait am I'm lose'n ya?<end_line>
Am I makin you look bad? <end_line>
Well I got news for your homie you're lose'n her<end_line>
Oh wait, she don't like when I spit it fast, I'ma try to show ya how<end_line>
Let me slow it<end_line>
It's still gonna be a blowout, you're gonna wanna throw out your whole album<end_line>
Rummage through the shit and try to salvage something<end_line>
To see if you can save any of it, bu-but none of it's fuck'n with me<end_line>
Prick you really feel'n that bullshit, you think you kill'n them syllables<end_line>
Quit play'n, these beats ain't nothing to fool with <end_line>
They call me Fire Marshall, I shut the shit down<end_line>
Your entire arsenal is not enough to fuck with one round<end_line>
I am also the opposite of what you are like<end_line>
You're a microcosm of what the fuck I am on the mic<end_line>
I am awesome, and you are just awe-struck<end_line>
She's love stricken, she's got her jaw stuck<end_line>
From suck'n my dick, aw fuck<end_line>
