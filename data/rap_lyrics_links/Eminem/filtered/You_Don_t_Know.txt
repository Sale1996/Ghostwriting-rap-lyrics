When me and Fif got together to do this music<end_line>
The more we became enveloped we just developed a fellowship through it<end_line>
It's no pretend shit, it's friendship, me nemesis is your nemesis<end_line>
Ain't for him, it's just media, see to them it's just images<end_line>
But this shit is no gimmicks, this is blood in and blood out<end_line>
When there's beef you jus' gotta know when to butt in and butt out<end_line>
If there's a problem we solve it, if we don't resolve it<end_line>
It usually just evolves into one big brawl and we all get involved in it<end_line>
We should all get a merit, this much beef we inherit<end_line>
And wear it like a badge with honor, pass it around and share it<end_line>
And let it go to whoever's holdin the most current people on their shoulders<end_line>
And their soldiers got their backs til it's over<end_line>
But tonight, we ain't comin here to beef with nobody<end_line>
We came to party, Banks, Cashis and Mr. Ferrari<end_line>
So is Shady Aftermizzath back in that ass? You izzask<end_line>
Come izzon, what kind of fizzucked up quizzestion is 'at?<end_line>
