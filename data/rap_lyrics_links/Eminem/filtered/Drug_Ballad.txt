Back when Mark Walhberg was Marky Mark<end_line>
This is how we used to make the party start<end_line>
We used to, mix Hen' with Bacardi Dark<end_line>
And when it, kicks in you can hardly talk<end_line>
And by the, sixth gin you're gon' probably crawl<end_line>
And you'll be, sick then and you'll probably barf<end_line>
And my pre-diction is you're gon' probably fall<end_line>
either somewhere in the lobby or the hallway wall<end_line>
And every-thing's spinnin, you're beginnin to think women <end_line>
are swimmin in pink linen again in the sink<end_line>
Then in a couple of minutes that bottle of Guinness is finished<end_line>
You are now allowed to officially slap bitches<end_line>
You have the right to remain violent and start wilin<end_line>
Start a fight with the same guy that was smart eyein you<end_line>
Get in your car, start it, and start drivin<end_line>
over the island and cause a 42 car pile-up<end_line>
Earth calling, pilot to co-pilot<end_line>
Look at the life on this planet sir, no sign of it<end_line>
All I can see is a bunch of smoke flyin<end_line>
And I'm so high that I might die if I go by it<end_line>
Let me out of this place, I'm outta place<end_line>
I'm in outer space, I've just vanished without a trace<end_line>
I'm going to a pretty place now where the flowers grow<end_line>
I'll be back in an hour or so<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
In third grade, all I used to do<end_line>
was sniff glue through a tube and play Rubix Cube<end_line>
Seventeen years later I'm as Rude as Jude<end_line>
Schemin on the first chick with the hugest boobs<end_line>
I've got no game, and every face looks the same<end_line>
They've got no name, so I don't need game to play<end_line>
I just say whatever I want to whoever I want<end_line>
Whenever I want, wherever I want, however I want<end_line>
However, I do show some respect to few<end_line>
This ecstacy's, got me standin next to you<end_line>
Getting sentimental as fuck spillin guts to you<end_line>
We just met, but I think I'm in love with you<end_line>
But you're on it too, so you tell me you love me too<end_line>
Wake up in the mornin like "Yo, what the fuck we do?"<end_line>
I gotta go bitch, you know I have stuff to do<end_line>
Cause if I get caught cheatin then I'm stuck with you<end_line>
But in the long run<end_line>
These drugs are probably going to catch up sooner or later<end_line>
But fuck it, I'm on one<end_line>
So let's enjoy, let the X destroy your spinal cord<end_line>
So it's not a straight line no more<end_line>
Til we walk around looking like some wind-up dolls<end_line>
Shit's stickin out of our backs like a dinosaur<end_line>
Shit, six hits won't even get me high no more<end_line>
So bye for now, I'm goin to try to find some more<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow<end_line>
When you swallow it all wollow and drown in your sorrow<end_line>
And tomorrow you're probably gonna want to do it again<end_line>
What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend? Screw it<end_line>
And what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning?<end_line>
And what's a little fight? Tomorrow you'll be boys again<end_line>
It's your life, live it however you wanna<end_line>
Mari-ju-uana is everywhere, where was you brought up?<end_line>
It don't matter as long as you get where you're goin<end_line>
Cause none of this shit is gonna mean shit where we're goin<end_line>
They tell you to stop, but you just sit there ignorin<end_line>
Even though you wake up feelin like shit every mornin<end_line>
But you're young, you've got a lot of drugs to do<end_line>
Girls to screw, parties to crash, sucks to be you<end_line>
If I could take it all back now, I wouldn't<end_line>
I would have did more shit that people said that I shouldn't<end_line>
But I'm all grown up now and upgraded and graduated<end_line>
to better drugs and updated<end_line>
But I still got a lot of growin up to do<end_line>
I still got a whole lot of throwin up to spew<end_line>
But when it's all said and done I'll be 40<end_line>
before I know it with a 40 on the porch tellin stories<end_line>
with a bottle of Jack, two grandkids in my lap<end_line>
Babysiting for Hailey while Hailey's out gettin smashed<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Drugs really got a hold of me<end_line>
They really got a hold of me<end_line>
Cause drugs really got ah old of me<end_line>
They really got a hold of me<end_line>
<verse_end>
