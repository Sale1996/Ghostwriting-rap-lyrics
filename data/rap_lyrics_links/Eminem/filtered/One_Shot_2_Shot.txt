<verse_start>
I never seen no shit like this in my life before<end_line>
People are still camped out from the night before<end_line>
Sleepin outside the door, waitin in line still<end_line>
tryin to get inside the club to see D-12 perform<end_line>
The fire marshalls know, the venue's too small<end_line>
People are wall to wall, three thousand and some odd<end_line>
fans and some cumwad from out the parking lot<end_line>
Gets in an argument over a parking spot<end_line>
Decides to pull his gun and lets a few of them off<end_line>
Missed who he's aimin for, six feet away is the door<end_line>
into St. Andrew's Hall, now the strays flyin all over the place<end_line>
Grazed one bitch in the face<end_line>
Another one of 'em came through the wall<end_line>
Before anyone could even hear the first shot go off<end_line>
I'm posted up at the bar, havin a mazeltov<end_line>
Bullet whizzed right by my ear, damn near shot it off<end_line>
Thank God I'm alive, I gotta find Denaun<end_line>
And where the fuck is Von?  He usually tucks one on him<end_line>
Wait a minute, I think I just saw Bizarre<end_line>
Nah I guess not, what the fuck?  Oh my God, it was!<end_line>
I never saw him run so fast in my life<end_line>
Look at him haulin ass, I think he left his wife<end_line>
There she is, on the ground, bein trampled<end_line>
I go to grab her up by the damn hand, but I can't pull her<end_line>
God damn, there just went another damn bullet<end_line>
I'm hit, my vest is barely able to handle it<end_line>
It's too thin, if I get hit again I can't do it<end_line>
I scoop D, follow Bizarre's path, ran through it and<end_line>
made it to the front door and collapsed<end_line>
on the steps looked up and I seen Swift<end_line>
Shootin it out but I can't see who he's shootin it out with<end_line>
But Denaun's right behind him, squeezin his four-fifth<end_line>
