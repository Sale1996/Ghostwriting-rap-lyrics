<verse_start>
At birth I was born with the biggest middle finger on earth<end_line>
The first time I went to stick it up the shit hurt<end_line>
Mom wouldn't take me<end_line>
The bitch still hates me<end_line>
Shit, one day she said, "Go rake leaves," <end_line>
I said, "Make me!"<end_line>
I'm proud to announce I was probably the first kid<end_line>
Who was kicked out of his house <end_line>
For making fart sounds with his mouth<end_line>
Arguing with me and mom was on-going<end_line>
She called law enforcement when I broke the law mower<end_line>
The slut gave me a truck when I turned sixteen<end_line>
I went to start it and it screamed, "Please fix me!"<end_line>
Back then, when Will Smith was still the Fresh Prince<end_line>
And him and Jeff were still best friends, I guess then<end_line>
I decided to cut class to rap full time<end_line>
And get the fuck outta this fake ass school and rhyme<end_line>
Anybody who thinks this fuckin attitude is a gimmick<end_line>
Come and see me, see if I don't live up to this image<end_line>
You fuckin' pricks!<end_line>
