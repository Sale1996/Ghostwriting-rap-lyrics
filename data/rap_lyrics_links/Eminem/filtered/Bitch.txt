We wrote a song for the hoes<end_line>
You like to hear it, here it goes<end_line>
A little somethin you probably won't hear on your radios<end_line>
So when it comes on in the club it's one that everyone knows<end_line>
And if I'm talking to fast it just means you're listening to slow<end_line>
And if you listen a little faster maybe you'll catch up, BITCH<end_line>
Ju jah jah jah dah du ju jah <end_line>
You just made me mess up, BITCH<end_line>
Blibiri babiler blabber<end_line>
It don't matter, I'm just blabbering <end_line>
Like you understand what I'm saying Anyway<end_line>
I'm just traveling in one ear and I'm out the other<end_line>
You're so fuckin drunk all you hear is the Beat and the beat<end_line>
I could be sayin anything, just get ya ass on the floor<end_line>
Wear the same pants that you wore from the day before<end_line>
Baby and shake that ass like a whore<end_line>

Get up and dance BITCH<end_line>
Wiggle that ass BITCH<end_line>
