We touch, I feel a rush, we clutch, it isn't much<end_line>
But it's enough to make me wonder what's in store for us, it's lust<end_line>
It's torturous, you must, be a sorceress cause you just<end_line>
did the impossible, gained my trust, don't play games it'll be dangerous<end_line>
if you fuck me over, cause if I get burnt I'ma show ya<end_line>
what it's like to hurt, cause I been treated like dirt, befo' ya<end_line>
And love is evol, spell it backwards I'll show ya<end_line>
Nobody knows me I'm cold, walk down this road all alone<end_line>
It's no one's fault but my own, it's the path I've chosen to go<end_line>
Frozen as snow, I show no emotion what-so-ever so<end_line>
Don't ask me why I have no, love for these muh'fuckin hoes<end_line>
Blood-suckin succubuses, what the fuck is up with this?<end_line>
I've tried in this department but, I ain't had no luck with this<end_line>
It sucks but it's exactly what I thought it would be like tryin to start over<end_line>
I got a hole in my heart but some kind of emotional roller coaster's<end_line>
somethin I won't go on so you toy with my emotions, hoe it's over<end_line>
It's like an explosion every time I hold ya, wasn't jokin when I told you<end_line>
You take my breath away, you're a supernova<end_line>
And I'm a<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I'll do whatever it takes, when I'm with you I get the shakes<end_line>
My body aches when I ain't, with you I have zero strength<end_line>
There's no limit on how far I would go, no boundaries no lengths<end_line>
Why do we say that until we get that person that we think's<end_line>
gonna be that one and then once we get 'em it's never the same<end_line>
You want 'em when they don't want you, soon as they do feelings change<end_line>
It's not a contest and I ain't on no conquest for no mate<end_line>
I wasn't lookin when I stumbled onto you, must've been fate<end_line>
But so much is at stake, what the fuck does it take? Let's cut to the chase<end_line>
'fore the door shuts in your face, promise me if I cave in and break<end_line>
and leave myself open that I won't be makin a mistake<end_line>
Cause I'm a<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
So after a year and six months, it's no longer me that you want<end_line>
But I love you so much it hurts, never mistreated you once<end_line>
I poured my heart out to you, let down my guard swear to God<end_line>
I'll blow my brains in your lap, lay here and die in your arms<end_line>
Drop to my knees and I'm pleadin, I'm tryin to stop you from leavin<end_line>
You won't even listen so fuck it, I'm tryin to stop you from breathin<end_line>
I put both hands on your throat, I sit on top of you squeezin<end_line>
'til I snap your neck like a popsicle stick, ain't no possible reason<end_line>
I can think of to let you walk up out this house and let you live<end_line>
Tears stream down both of my cheeks, then I let you go and just give<end_line>
And 'fore I put that gun to my temple I told you this<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
And I would've did anything for you<end_line>
To show you how much I adored you<end_line>
But it's over now, it's too late to save our, love<end_line>
Just promise me you'll think of me<end_line>
Every time you look up in the sky and see a star cause I'm a<end_line>
<verse_end>
