She thinks I'm bein mean and now she starts to scream and shout, she's about to let the demons out<end_line>
She don't wanna see me with other females out, I tell the bitch to beat it, take the scenic route<end_line>
She retaliates by tryin to leave the house in an evening gown with her cleavage out<end_line>
We've been down this road too many times for me to count, and all I can think is how<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
And I don't know what's got a hold of me, most notably I've been zonin to Jodeci<end_line>
I'm totally open, hopelessly devoted, so much so that I bet you she don't even know that she's<end_line>
the first thing I think of when I wake up and the last thing I think of 'fore I go to sleep<end_line>
Sike, hope she don't notice me goin through her purse, I know she cheats, so do I, I'm soulless, she's<end_line>
heartless, no wonder we're partners, both got hundreds of charges<end_line>
Domestic disputes but we've always swept it under the carpet<end_line>
Even when 911 gets the call that, I slipped up and busted her jaw with<end_line>
a Louisville Slugger cause all's it, really does is make our love<end_line>
for each other grow stronger, she won me over the second she tried to run me over<end_line>
Told her I'd keep it a hun', we over, kicked her out, called her back, now she's coming over<end_line>
But why is she so wicked? And how the fuck did I get so twisted?<end_line>
I'm with someone so unlikeable and shifty, we're like nitrogen and hydrogen mixed with<end_line>
ignitable liquids, but I'm finally seeing she's only mine for the time being<end_line>
That's why I keep, bringin up that one time she, tried to two-time me<end_line>
And throw it up in her face 'til I dry heave, how could I, be so naive?<end_line>
Should I leave or turn this entire evening to a motherfuckin crime scene?!<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Maybe I'm just too ugly to compete with, him, you weren't supposed to agree, you fucking bitch!<end_line>
Especially when you're the one cheated first, now the argument immediately becomes heated<end_line>
You don't want me to flip, little conceited cunt eat a monkey dick wrapped in a stuffed pita fajita<end_line>
Slut, treat it just like a drum, beat it, complete it, and once you've succeeded, repeat it!<end_line>
... I love you but I hope you fuckin die though<end_line>
In our business your friends like to pry so, you've got 'em all undercover just like moles<end_line>
Hopin they'll come back with intel, but I'm the one who's thrown into the spiral<end_line>
Cause now the roles are reversed so here I go, thinkin I'm sly as I scroll<end_line>
through your iPhone, who the fuck's Milo? The guy at work who drives a Hi-Lo<end_line>
I put a trackin device on your Chrysler and follow you while you drive home<end_line>
But like a cyclone, I just got my disguise blown<end_line>
You recognize me and had Milo flip me off right out the passenger side window<end_line>
I hit a light pole, you skrrt off and then pull up at 5 AM in the drive in a stretch white limo<end_line>
Stumble in the side door and hit me in the head with Milo's demo<end_line>
But like a drunk bum, what do I know? Let's sleep on it like they did "Revival"<end_line>
I told you you're the apple of my eye so shut your pie hole<end_line>
<verse_end>
