Black boy, black boy, we ain't gonna lie to you<end_line>
Black boy, black boy, we don't like the sight of you<end_line>
Pull up on the side of you<end_line>
Window rolled down, profile, then we wonder why we see this side of youuuu!<end_line>
Probably comin from the dope house<end_line>
We could let you slide but your tail light is blew, out<end_line>
We know you're hidin that Heidi Klum<end_line>
on you, another drug charge homie, it's back inside for you!<end_line>
And just in case a chase might ensue, we got that tried and true<end_line>
Pistol drew right at you, we'd be delighted to<end_line>
unload it in your back then walk up and lay that taser on the side of you<end_line>
Fucked up, but what the fuck am I to do?<end_line>
I keep tellin myself keep doin like you're doin<end_line>
No matter how many lives you ruin<end_line>
It's for the red, white and blue, time to go find a new<end_line>
one and split his head right in two, no one's ever indicted you<end_line>
Why? Cause you're a<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Black boy, black boy, we don't get your culture and<end_line>
We don't care what our government's done to fuck you over, man<end_line>
Don't tell us your attitude's a result of that<end_line>
Balderdash, where'd you get the chip on your shoulder at?<end_line>
Why you kickin that soda can?<end_line>
Pull your pants up, we 'bout to roll up and<end_line>
throw your ass in the van cuffed, you don't have to know our plans<end_line>
or what our intentions are, our cards are close to our chest, you better show your hands!<end_line>
And put our minds more at ease<end_line>
Or get shot in the thyroid, comply or die, boy<end_line>
We're fightin a crime war<end_line>
Here come the swine, tryna clean up the streets from all these minorities<end_line>
That's what we call 'em pigsties for<end_line>
They're like eyesores to police<end_line>
Talked to like you're just a piece of trash<end_line>
Feels like we're stuck in a time warp to me<end_line>
As I kick these facts and, get these mixed reactions<end_line>
As this beat backspins, it's like we're drifting back in-<end_line>
-to the '60s, havin<end_line>
black skin is risky cause this keeps happenin<end_line>
Throughout history African-Americans have been treated like shit<end_line>
And I admit there have been times where it's been embarrassin<end_line>
to be a<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Seems like, the average life span of, a white man<end_line>
is more than twice than a, black life span<end_line>
I, wonder sometimes if it has a price scanner<end_line>
I feel like checkin out on life, can't e-scape, this circumstance<end_line>
I'd rather, hear 'em say "Die N-word," than Die Antwoord<end_line>
Ninja, now it's better disguised banter<end_line>
But that's life, strapped<end_line>
Cause we're strapped financially and can't find answers<end_line>
We're applyin but McDonald's, seems to, be the only franchise that'll hire<end_line>
So how can we have higher standards?<end_line>
As Dallas overshadows the battle for Black Lives Matter<end_line>
We fight back with violence but acts like that are<end_line>
black eyes on the movement, which makes black lives madder<end_line>
at cops, and cops madder<end_line>
That's why it's at a, stalemate<end_line>
And can't arrive at a compromise so it's Black Ops<end_line>
I wonder if we hire more, black cops, the crap stops<end_line>
The block is our back yards, officers, not the crack spot<end_line>
Call the attack dogs off of us<end_line>
Man, you always act all pissed off at us at a traffic stop<end_line>
And bad cops, fuck it up, for the good cops<end_line>
And man stop, sendin white cops<end_line>
into black neighborhoods, who ain't acclimated to 'em<end_line>
Like that's the way to do it<end_line>
Who seen some fuckin videos of rappers wavin guns<end_line>
Ain't know nobody black, so they act afraid of us<end_line>
And that's racism, the fear that a black face gives 'em<end_line>
A subconscious racist, wait, why are there black neighborhoods?<end_line>
Cause America segregated us<end_line>
Designated us to an area, separated us<end_line>
Section-Eight'd us, when we tear it up's<end_line>
the only time attention's paid to, us, and education, sucks<end_line>
And every day's a-no-ther Freddie Grey for, us<end_line>
A levy breaks or, fuzz, why is it?<end_line>
They treat us like dryer lint<end_line>
We just want a safe environment for our kids, but can't escape the sirens<end_line>
Don't take a scientist to see our violent nature lies in<end_line>
the poverty that we face so the crime rate's the highest in<end_line>
the lowest classes, it's like a razor wire fence<end_line>
And we're trapped in, these racial biases<end_line>
that plague our society, which makes our anxiety levels raise<end_line>
every time we see a devil's face<end_line>
Lions, tigers and bears, oh my; it's more like billy clubs and, gats<end_line>
And we really love it when you think we're guilty cause we're, black<end_line>
"But you kill each other, facts<end_line>
You peel each other's, caps, for silly stuff like, hats!"<end_line>
Single mother strugglin through substance abuse<end_line>
while people with nothin to lose shoot each other for shoes<end_line>
Fuck your Republican views<end_line>
Pull ourselves up by our bootstraps, where the fuck are the boots?<end_line>
And streets act as a narrator<end_line>
Don't gotta read comics, or be that into characters<end_line>
Just to see that, just to be black, you better be strapped with a derringer<end_line>
Or be +Capped-in America+, like Steve Rogers<end_line>
Cause no one oversees, these cops and<end_line>
All we see is 'em beat charges<end_line>
We done seen 'em beat Rodney King unconscious and got off<end_line>
So we don't need all you crooked police officers' peace offerings<end_line>
... Just keep marchin<end_line>
... 'til we reach Congress<end_line>
But they're gonna say you're tryin to take an irrational stance<end_line>
if you try to slander the flag but somebody has to be the sacrificial lamb<end_line>
So they called it a Kaepernick tantrum<end_line>
if you don't stand for the National Anthem<end_line>
We raise it, you better praise it or you'll be made to feel<end_line>
like a traitor we'll, treat you like Rodney Dangerfield<end_line>
Home of the brave is still, racist 'ville<end_line>
So this whole nation feels like a plantation field<end_line>
In a country that claims that its foundation was based on United States ideals<end_line>
that had its Natives killed<end_line>
Got you singin this "Star-Spangled" spiel<end_line>
to a piece of cloth that represents the +Land of the Free+ that made people slaves to BUILD!<end_line>
