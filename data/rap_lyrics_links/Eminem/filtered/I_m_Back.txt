Thirteen I was puttin shells in a gauge on a shelf<end_line>
I used to, get punked and bullied on my block<end_line>
'til I cut a kitten's head off and stuck it in this kid's mailbox<end_line>
I used to give a - fuck, now I could give a fuck less<end_line>
What do I think of suc-cess?  It sucks, too much press I'm stressed<end_line>
Too much stares two breasts, too upset<end_line>

I take each individual degenerate's head and reach into it<end_line>
just to see if he's influenced by me if he listens to music<end_line>
And if he feeds into this shit he's an innocent victim<end_line>
and becomes a puppet on the string of my tennis shoe <end_line>
My name is Slim Shady<end_line>
I been crazy way before radio didn't play me<end_line>
The sensational<end_line>
With Ken Kaniff, who just finds the men edible<end_line>

Tryin to, lure your kids with him, into bed<end_line>
It's a, sick world we live in these days<end_line>
"Slim for Pete's sakes put down Christopher Reeve's legs!"<end_line>
Geez, you guys are so sensitive<end_line>
"Slim it's a touchy subject, try and just don't mention it"<end_line>
Mind with no sense in it, fried to get so frenetic<end_line>
whose eyes get so squinted, I'm blind from smokin 'em<end_line>
with my windows tinted, with nine limos rented<end_line>
Doin lines of coke in 'em, with a bunch of guys hoppin out <end_line>
all high and indo scented<end_line>
And that's where I get my name from, that's why they call me<end_line>
<verse_end>

Should I dye my hair pink and care what y'all think?<end_line>
Lip sync and buy a bigger size of earrings?<end_line>
It's why I tend to block out when I hear things<end_line>
Cause all these fans screamin is makin my ears ring<end_line>
So I just, throw up a middle finger and let it linger<end_line>
longer than the rumor that I was stickin it to Christina<end_line>
Cause if I ever stuck it to any singer in showbiz<end_line>
it'd be Jennifer Lopez, and Puffy you know this!<end_line>
I'm sorry Puff, but I don't give a fuck if this chick was my own mother<end_line>
