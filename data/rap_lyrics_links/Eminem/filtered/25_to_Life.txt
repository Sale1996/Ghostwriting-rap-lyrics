<verse_start>
I don't think she understands the sacrifices that I've made<end_line>
Maybe if this bitch had acted right I would've stayed<end_line>
But I've already wasted over half of my life I would've laid<end_line>
Down and died for you I no longer cry for you<end_line>
No more pain bitch you<end_line>
Took me for granted took my heart and ran it straight into the planet<end_line>
Into the dirt I can no longer stand it<end_line>
Now my respect I demand it<end_line>
I'ma take control of this relationship<end_line>
Command it, and I'ma be the boss of you now goddamnit<end_line>
And what I mean is that I will no longer let you control me<end_line>
So you better hear me out this much you owe me<end_line>
I gave up my life for you, totally devoted to you, why I've stayed<end_line>
Faithful all the way this is how I fucking get repaid?<end_line>
Look at how I dress fucking baggy sweats, go to work a mess<end_line>
Always in a rush to get back to you I ain't heard you yet<end_line>
Not even once say you appreciate me I deserve respect<end_line>
I've done my best to give you nothing less than perfectness<end_line>
And I know that if I end this I'll no longer have nothing left<end_line>
But you keep treating me like a staircase its time to fucking step<end_line>
And I won't be coming back so don't hold your fucking breath<end_line>
You know what you've done no need to go in depth<end_line>
I told you, you'd be sorry if I fucking left<end_line>
I'd laugh while you wept<end_line>
How's it feel now, yeah, funny ain't it, you neglected me<end_line>
Did me a favour though my spirit free you've set<end_line>
But a special place for you in my heart I have kept<end_line>
It's unfortunate but it's<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I feel like when I bend over backwards for you all you do is laugh<end_line>
Cause that ain't good enough you expect me to fold myself in half<end_line>
Till I snap<end_line>
Don't think I'm loyal? All I do is rap<end_line>
I can not moonlight on the side<end_line>
I have no life outside of that<end_line>
Don't I give you enough of my time<end_line>
You don't think so do you<end_line>
Jealous when I spend time with the girls<end_line>
Why I'm married to you still man I don't know<end_line>
But tonight I'm serving you with papers I'm divorcing you<end_line>
Go marry someone else and make em famous<end_line>
And take away there freedom like you did to me<end_line>
Treat em like you don't need em and they ain't worthy of you<end_line>
Feed em the same shit that you made me eat<end_line>
I'm moving on forget you oh,<end_line>
Now I'm special, I ain't feel special when I was with you<end_line>
All I ever felt was this<end_line>
Imprisoned by a selfish bitch<end_line>
Chewed me up and spit me out<end_line>
I fell for this so many times<end_line>
It's ridiculous<end_line>
And still I stick with this<end_line>
I'm sick of this but in my sickness and addiction<end_line>
You're addictive as they get<end_line>
Evil as they come vindictive as they make em<end_line>
My friends keep asking me why I cant just walk away from<end_line>
I'm addicted<end_line>
To the pain, the stress, the drama<end_line>
I'm drawn in, shit I guess I'm a mess<end_line>
Cursed and blessed<end_line>
But this time I<end_line>
Aint changing my mind<end_line>
I'm climbing out this abyss<end_line>
You screaming as I walk out that ill be missed<end_line>
But when you spoke of people who meant the most to you<end_line>
You left me off your list<end_line>
Fuck you hip-hop<end_line>
I'm leaving you, my life sentence is served bitch<end_line>
And its just<end_line>
<verse_end>
