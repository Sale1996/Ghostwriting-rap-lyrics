Life handed me lemons, I jumped back in the public eye<end_line>
and squirted lemon juice in it, by now you just wish I'd fuckin die<end_line>
But I electrify, get electrocuted, executed by<end_line>
the execution of my flow too quick for the human eye to detect zoomin by<end_line>
Gue-gue-guess who? What's happenin guy?<end_line>
They told me to shit, I fell off that pot, hopped right back on that crapper and I<end_line>
said fuck IT with a capital I, look who's back to antag-g-gonize<end_line>
You don't like it you can eat shit, fuck off little faggot and die<end_line>
You right back like a magnet on my dick grabbin at my<end_line>
shit better get to the back of the line<end_line>
If you wanna get your shot at me, what kind of crap is that? Battle, what kind <end_line>
of rapper would I, be? 'Fore I let another rapper think he's hot<end_line>
I'll bury my face in a stinky twat and go ah-ladl-lah-ladl-lah-ladl-LAH!<end_line>
Girl my head space is limited, ain't even room in the back of my mind<end_line>
So I ain't thinkin about you, I don't got time, I done told you a thousand times<end_line>
So how could I find the time to put an Alkaline <end_line>
battery in Royce's back and at the same time put juice in mine? <end_line>
Goddamn it, Slaughterhouse is SIGNED!<end_line>

I'm a - menace villian, my pen is sick and spillin, my lyrics killin<end_line>
Then I let you witness shit when it hit the ceilin<end_line>
A nigga's willin to give the listeners the sickest feelin<end_line>
Like mixin some Benadryl and penicillin then I'm fillin<end_line>
a clip with a written, can you picture my pistol drillin<end_line>
a million women and children when I'm illin but it isn't real it's<end_line>
a rap, on the real it's a wrap, how could you possibly stop the apocalypse<end_line>
when I'm atomic bombin the populous?<end_line>
Shock the metropolis, hostile as a kid, poppin a glock at his<end_line>
moms and his pops then he hops in his drop, with his iPod rockin his <end_line>
Slaughterish documentation of lyrics, I write with confidence<end_line>
Write like a columnist slash novelist<end_line>
I'm in this game to demolish it, establish my dominance<end_line>
over prominent rappers, you poppin shit to ya opposite<end_line>
I can spit ominous so spit politics<end_line>
Now I'm Haile Selassie, Gandhi and 'Pac of this hip-hop genre BITCH!<end_line>
