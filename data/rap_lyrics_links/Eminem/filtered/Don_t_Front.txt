<verse_start>
Used to get, bent, now I represent to the fullest<end_line>
Pencil is full of insolent bullets<end_line>
I'm like a Doberman Pinscher, Pit Bull and a Rott'<end_line>
Mixed with a toxic, the plot begins to thicken, I<end_line>
begin to spittin like vintage 'Pac demented<end_line>
Demonic sinister, ever since the Doc replenished<end_line>
me the day he gave me that shot when I was just about to quit<end_line>
So to not see him with, me would be a shocking image<end_line>
And I'm the definition of what a concrete chin is<end_line>
Cause no matter how many times you sock me in it<end_line>
And knock me to the canvas, even the boxing critics<end_line>
know that if I get off to a rocky start, I'll always have a Rocky finish!<end_line>
Eat me broccoli, spinach, cocky? Nope, but I hope I offended<end_line>
you when I told ya how dope I am at this<end_line>
And put emphasis on the "dope" so when names come up<end_line>
in that conversation of who's the dopest, better throw mine in it<end_line>
And don't mind me, while I remind you of the flow<end_line>
you won't find anywhere, when it fires and I unload, my pen explodes<end_line>
'til there's no rhymes in it - reload in no time<end_line>
Let insults fly every sixty seconds that go by so you know I meant it/minute!<end_line>
... In school I was so shy, timid<end_line>
Two pairs of jeans I'd alternate, bummy clothes, I 'member<end_line>
beggin my mom for K-Mart MacGregors cause those were new<end_line>
Saint Vincent de Paul, those Pony's were used, and no size fitted<end_line>
But kiss them old days adios, I did it<end_line>
They said I was a gimmick, now I'm the one that those guys mimic<end_line>
Now you fuckers don't wanna go startin no argument<end_line>
Cause you know I'll win it, name a flow that's mo' authentic<end_line>
And don't front<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Rest in piece to Big Proof, you was a beast<end_line>
You lyrically mirrored me<end_line>
Molded my flow off of you, your spirit's flowin through me<end_line>
I love you Doody, without you I feel so incomplete<end_line>
I'm no king, no need for rose petals to be thrown at my feet<end_line>
I'm a thorn in your side, get thrown into a throne, better watch the fuckin tone that you speak<end_line>
Feel like I'm in a zone, I'm in a whole different league<end_line>
On my motherfuckin own, it's just me<end_line>
No opponents can compete, and I've never been known to retreat<end_line>
from beef, beep-beep, follow trends or wallow in defeat<end_line>
I'm still hungry as FUCK, but can't even say bon appetit<end_line>
Cause I don't know what to eat, fuckin microphone or the BEAT<end_line>
Bitch, nobody's mind works like mine, it's nose to the grind-<end_line>
-stone time holmes, your mind's blown cause I rhyme<end_line>
like I'm still tryin to get signed<end_line>
Up in the Ebony Show-case with Denaun screamin<end_line>
Never asked you like my shit from the git<end_line>
I'd rather ask you to wipe my ass, bitch<end_line>
You had you a nice, run, now take a hike<end_line>
I ever meet my match, I'ma strike that bitch first, cause on the mic<end_line>
I gotta represent the real rappers<end_line>
The real rappers get their motherfuckin skills crackin<end_line>
Word to Buckshot and Dru-Ha, why the fuck not? You don't like it? Suck a cock<end_line>
Almost forgot, before I signed with the Doc<end_line>
I almost signed with<end_line>
Cause Rawkus didn't make no offers and motherfuck Loud, they jerked me around so what's up now?<end_line>
Wow, how much of an asshole would I sound<end_line>
like rubbin it in and holdin some grudge now<end_line>
But don't front<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Late at night used to catch a buzz, couldn't write<end_line>
Now I write, the type of shit to make you wipe<end_line>
But wear diapers cause you might<end_line>
leave a streak, I'm on a streak windshield wipers couldn't wipe<end_line>
It's hard to decipher which cypher I might jump in tonight<end_line>
Cause I'm hyper or somethin, needin someone or somethin is light-<end_line>
-ing the fire under me, it's breathin new life<end_line>
It's like I already died once, I guess some people only live twice<end_line>
And it's funny, my days of bein broke are so long ago, I lost all concept of money<end_line>
But you dimes won't get a fuckin nickle from me<end_line>
Oh shit, I'm down on one knee<end_line>
I'm havin a stroke of genius, "Elizabeth I'm comin to you honey!"<end_line>
Uhh, from boy to man<end_line>
And still make a whore-moan/hormone like a thyroid gland<end_line>
I'm in another category man<end_line>
Don't group me up with them pop stars, I never needed a pat on the back to get at-a-boy, band<end_line>
No offense, YES offense!<end_line>
Precedence has been set that'll never get met<end_line>
Middle finger pressed against, Moby's nose<end_line>
Shout to Obie, the +Curtain's Closed+ on my +Show+<end_line>
You can't take it, OHH!<end_line>
Got a whole generation of rappers comin up that are nutty with the flow<end_line>
But convince me you've heard, an MC since me who's this good with the fuckin mincing of words<end_line>
without mincing words that'll make you feel like I'm pinching a nerve<end_line>
Whose as mentally disturbed, you might as well stick a knife in me and turn<end_line>
It'll be like my skin bein Indian burned<end_line>
Ahh, bitch there isn't one, when will you learn?<end_line>
Never been served if memory serves<end_line>
I'll battle THAT, 'til my own recollection remembers these words<end_line>
Don't front!<end_line>
<verse_end>
