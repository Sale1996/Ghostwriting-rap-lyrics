<verse_start>
Came to the world at a time when it was in need of a villain<end_line>
An asshole, that role think I succeeded fulfillin<end_line>
But don't think I ever stopped to think that I was speakin to children<end_line>
Everything was happenin so fast it was like I blinked, sold three million<end_line>
Then it all went blank, all I remember is feelin ridiculous cause I was gettin sick of this feelin<end_line>
Like I'm always under attack, man I coulda stacked my shit-list to the ceiling<end_line>
Women dishin but really<end_line>
thinkin if anyone ever talks to one of my little girls like this I would kill him<end_line>
Guess I'm a little bit of a hypocrite when I'm rippin shit, but since when did this many<end_line>
people ever give a shit what I had to say? It's just my opinion<end_line>
If it contradicts how I'm livin put a dick in your rear end<end_line>
That's why every time you mention a lyric<end_line>
I thanked you for it, for drawin more attention toward it<end_line>
Cause it gave me an enormous platform, I'm flattered you thought I was that important<end_line>
But you can't ignore the fact that I fought for the respect, and battled for it<end_line>
Mad awards, had GLAAD annoyed, atta-boy<end_line>
They told me to slow down, I'd just zone out<end_line>
Good luck tryin to convince a blonde, it's like tellin Gwen Stefani she sold out<end_line>
Cause I was tryin to leave, +No Doubt+<end_line>
in anyone's mind one day I'd go down, in history think they know now!<end_line>
Because EVERYBODY knows!<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Quit actin salty, I was countin on you to count me out<end_line>
Ask Asher Roth when he roundabout dissed me to shout me out<end_line>
Thought I was history, well goddamn honkey; that compliment's like back-handin a donkey<end_line>
Good way to get your ass socked in the mouth<end_line>
Nah, I'm off him, but what the fuck's all this trash talking about?<end_line>
The fight was fixed, I'm back and you can't stop me, you knocked me down<end_line>
I went down for the count, I fell but the fans caught me and now<end_line>
you're gonna have to beat the fuckin pants off me to take my belt, word to Pacquiao!<end_line>
Momma said there ain't nothin else to talk about<end_line>
Better go in that ring and knock 'em out, or you better not come out<end_line>
It's poetry in motion, like Freddie Roach when he's quotin<end_line>
Shake-speare, so what if insults are revoltin?<end_line>
Even Helen Keller knows life stinks<end_line>
You think it's a joke 'til you're bullet-riddled, but you should give little shit what I think<end_line>
This whole world is a mess, gotta have a goddamn<end_line>
vest on your chest and a Glock just to go watch Batman<end_line>
Who needs to test the testicles? Not that man<end_line>
Half of you don't got the guts, intestinal blockage, rest of you got lap bands<end_line>
Stuck to this motto 'fore they put bath salts in all those<end_line>
water bottles in Colorado, so get lost Waldo<end_line>
My soul's escaping through this asshole that is gaping<end_line>
A black hole and I'm swallowin this track whole, better pack toilet paper<end_line>
But I'm takin no crap hoe, here I go down the Bat Pole<end_line>
and I'm changing back into that ol' maniac, in fact there they go<end_line>
Tryin to dip out the back door retreating cause EVERYBODY knows!<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Holy mackerel, I'm the biggest jerk on the planet Earth, I smacked a girl<end_line>
off the mechanical bull at a tractor pull<end_line>
for thinkin we had some magnetic pull<end_line>
Then screamed, "ICP in this bitch! How do fuckin magnets work?"<end_line>
Cause you're attractive but we ain't attractable, hate to be dramatical<end_line>
but I'm not romantical, I'm makin up words you can understandable, it's tragical<end_line>
Thinkin some magical shit's gonna happen, that ain't practical<end_line>
You crackin a joke? It's laughable<end_line>
Cause me and love's like a bad combination<end_line>
I keep them feelings locked in a vault, so it's safe to say, I'm un-crackable<end_line>
My heart is truly guarded, full body armor<end_line>
Bitch you just need a helmet, cause if you think you're special, you're retarded<end_line>
Thinkin you're one of a kind like you got some platinum vagina<end_line>
You're a train wreck, I got a one track mind and<end_line>
shorty you're fine but you sorta remind me of a 49er<end_line>
Cause you've been a gold-digger since you was a miner/minor<end_line>
Been tryin to, hunt me down like a dog cause you're on my ass but you can't get a scent<end_line>
Cause all of my spare time's spent<end_line>
on my nose in this binder, so don't bother tryin<end_line>
Only women that I love are my daughters, but sometimes I rhyme<end_line>
and it sounds like I forget I'm a father, and I push it farther<end_line>
So father forgive me if I forget to draw the line<end_line>
It's apparent I shouldn't have been a parent, I'll never grow up<end_line>
So to hell with your parents, and +mother+fuck +Father+ Time<end_line>
It ain't never gonna stop, a pessimist who +Transformed+ to an +Optimist+ in his +Prime+<end_line>
So even if I'm half-dead, I'm half-alive<end_line>
Poured my half-empty glass in a cup, now my cup has runneth over<end_line>
And I'm 'bout to set it on you like a motherfuckin coaster!<end_line>
I'm goin back to what got me here<end_line>
Yeah cocky and can't knock bein Rudolph, so fear not my dear/deer<end_line>
And dry up your tear drops, I'm here<end_line>
White America's mirror, so don't feel awkward or weird<end_line>
if you stare at me and see yourself, cause you're one too, shouldn't be a shock<end_line>
because EVERYBODY knows<end_line>
<verse_end>
