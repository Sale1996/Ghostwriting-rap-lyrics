There's an intruder.. in my house<end_line>
He cut my phone line.. can't dial out<end_line>
I scream for police.. but I doubt<end_line>
They're gonna hear me.. when I shout<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
A couple of cocktails'll send me to jail<end_line>
There's a couple of cops hot on my trail<end_line>
But this time, when I get pulled over<end_line>
there's a Doberman Pinscher and a pitbull in the seat<end_line>
These pigs'll get bit foolin with me, quit foolin with me<end_line>
Bitch, you're gonna see, no pistol in the seat<end_line>
Why it always gotta be an issue when you're me?<end_line>
And which you're gonna see in the long run, I'ma be the wrong one<end_line>
you wanna harass with this limo-tinted glass<end_line>
Flashin that flashlight on my ass, where was you at<end_line>
last night when them assholes, ran up on my grass?<end_line>
Rapper slash actor - kiss the crack of my cracker slash ass<end_line>
They took away my right to bear arms<end_line>
What I'm 'posed to fight with bear palms?<end_line>
Yeah right - they comin with bombs, I'm comin with flare guns<end_line>
We as Americans<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I make beaucoup bucks, wearin beaucoup vests<end_line>
Drama hanging over my head like a voodoo hex<end_line>
I coulda been next to fly over the cuckoo's nest<end_line>
with you know who, with an 'S' tatooed to my chest<end_line>
But I've finessed it, now I've got the industry pissy<end_line>
Ever since me and Dre split it fifty-fifty on 50<end_line>
It's funny, we got a buzz spreadin quicker than makin<end_line>
paper airplanes out of a twenty - fuck money!<end_line>
I don't rap for dead presidents; I'd rather see the President<end_line>
It's never been said, but I set precedents<end_line>
and the standards and they can't stand it<end_line>
My name shoulda been bastard, the shit shoulda been plastered<end_line>
on my forehead with a stamp, I shoulda been blasted<end_line>
I shoulda been had a cap put in my ass<end_line>
But I'm too swift and fast for that, I'm past it<end_line>
I'm too old to go and cruise Gratiot, fuck that shit<end_line>
I done seen how fast this rap shit<end_line>
can turn into some pap-pap shit, that quick, snap click<end_line>
But this time they got fuckin auto-ma-tic<end_line>
Ain't no one gon' test this mon, clack-click!<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I got a secret if you can keep it between us<end_line>
I tuck two nina's under my jeans either side of my penis<end_line>
Under my longjohns, under my Sean Johns<end_line>
When runnin with the long arm of the law I'm long gone<end_line>
I'ma do five years, no less than that, no questions asked<end_line>
So it might be a good idea to stop right here<end_line>
And quit while I'm ahead, already in the red<end_line>
Already got a steady infrared mapped on my head<end_line>
A target on my back, bigger problems than that<end_line>
Bin Laden on my ass, he probably gon' send a task<end_line>
I ain't gon' even ask, they ain't gon' let me pack<end_line>
They ain't gon' gimme my semi but I got my mac back<end_line>
<verse_end>
