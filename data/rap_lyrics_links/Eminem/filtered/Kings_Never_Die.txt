I can hear the drummer drummin, and the trumpets, someone's<end_line>
tryna summon someone, I know somethin's comin, but I'm runnin from it<end_line>
To be standin at the summit and plummet, how come it wasn't what I thought it was, was it<end_line>
too good to be true? Have nothin, get it all but too much of it<end_line>
Then lose it again, then I swallow hallucinogens<end_line>
Cause if not, where the hell did it go? Cause here I sit in Lucifer's den<end_line>
by the dutch oven just choosin to sin<end_line>
Even if it means I'm sellin my soul, just to be the undisputed again, do whatever I gotta do just to win<end_line>
Cause I got this muh'fuckin cloud over my head, crown around it, thorns on it<end_line>
Cracks in it, bet you morons didn't, think I'd be back, did ya?<end_line>
How 'bout that I'm somehow now back to the underdog but no matter how loud that<end_line>
I bark, this sport is somethin I never bow-wow'd at<end_line>
I complain about the game, I shout and I pout<end_line>
It's a love-hate, but I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt<end_line>
Even when you bitches are countin me out, and I appear to be down for the count<end_line>
Only time I ever been out and about is drivin around town with my fuckin whereabouts in a doubt<end_line>
Cause, I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here but I'm not a quitter<end_line>
Gotta get up, give it all I got or give up<end_line>
Spit or shit or stepped on but kept goin<end_line>
I'm tryna be headstrong but it feels like I slept on my neck wrong<end_line>
Cause you're movin onto the next, but is your respect gone?<end_line>
Cause someone told me that<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Don't give me that sob story liar, don't preach to the choir<end_line>
You ain't never even had to reach in the fire<end_line>
to dig deep, nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer<end_line>
Wouldn't even take shit into consideration<end_line>
Obliterate anyone in the way, I think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features<end_line>
and try to show out on a track with me - but it'd actually<end_line>
have to be a fuckin blowout to get me to retire<end_line>
Tell these new artists that kings never die, I know shit has changed in this age<end_line>
Fuck a Twitter page, did it just say I've been upstaged?<end_line>
Why am I online? It's drivin me crazy, I'm ridin shotgun tryna get a gauge<end_line>
on what's hot, but I'm not gonna conform, better stay<end_line>
passin this, shit and opinions sway, I can hear 'em say<end_line>
if I stay passionate, maybe I can stay Jay miraculous, come back as if I went away<end_line>
But detractors just say some bullshit for the +Renegade+<end_line>
Someone's gonna make me blow my composure, here I go again, to the stage<end_line>
and I feel like I'm in a cage - they so want a champion to fall<end_line>
I still wonder why I laugh at 'em cause why carry when I'm all so - fuck what these cynics say!<end_line>
It just goes to show that, when my back's against the wall<end_line>
And I'm under attack again that I'll act as if I'm posted up with this pent-up rage<end_line>
Cause - cause all these plaques in my office, on the floor stacked against the door<end_line>
All be just metaphors for the odds of, when you comin back again cause all<end_line>
the accomplishments, accolades, awards and trophies, just don't mean jack anymore<end_line>
Cause I'm here today and, gone tomorrow<end_line>
And I'm not gonna be<end_line>
<verse_end>
