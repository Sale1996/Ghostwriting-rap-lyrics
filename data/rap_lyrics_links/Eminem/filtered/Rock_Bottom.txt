<verse_start>
I feel like I'm walkin a tight rope, without a circus net<end_line>
Poppin percocet, I'm a nervous wreck<end_line>
I deserve respect; but I work and sweat for this worthless check<end_line>
I'm bout to burst this tech at somebody to reverse this debt<end_line>
Minimum wage got my adrenaline caged<end_line>
Full of venom and rage, 'specially when I'm engaged<end_line>
and my daughter's down to her last diaper, it's got my ass hyper<end_line>
I pray that God answers, maybe I'll ask nicer<end_line>
Watchin ballers while they flossin in they Pathfinders<end_line>
These overnight stars becomin autograph signers<end_line>
We all long to blow up and leave the past behind us<end_line>
Along with the small fry's and average half pinters<end_line>
But playa haters turnin bitch like they have vaginas<end_line>
Cause we see them dollar signs and let the cash blind us<end_line>
Money'll brainwash you and leave yo' ass mindless<end_line>
when snakes slither in the grass spineless<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
My life is full of empty promises and broken dreams<end_line>
I'm hopin things look up; but there ain't no job openings<end_line>
I feel discouraged, hungry and malnourished<end_line>
Living in this house with no furnace, unfurnished<end_line>
And I'm sick of workin dead end jobs with lame pay<end_line>
And I'm tired of being hired and fired the same day<end_line>
But fuck it, if you know the rules to the game play<end_line>
Cause when we die we know we all going the same way<end_line>
Cause it's cool to be player, but it sucks to be the fan<end_line>
When all you need is bucks to be the man, plus a luxury sedan<end_line>
I'm comfortable and roomy in a six<end_line>
But they threw me in the mix with all these gloomy lunatics<end_line>
who walk around depressed, and smoke a pound of sess a day<end_line>
And yesterday went by so quick it seems like it was just today<end_line>
My daughter wants to throw the ball but I'm too stressed to play<end_line>
Live half my life and throw the rest away<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
There's people that love me, and people that hate me<end_line>
But it's the evil that made me this backstabbin deceitful and shady<end_line>
I want the money, the women, the fortune and fame<end_line>
if it means I end up burnin in hell scorchin in flames<end_line>
if it means I'm stealin your checkbook and forgin your name<end_line>
This lifetime bliss for eternal torture and pain<end_line>
Cause right now, I feel like just hit the rock bottom<end_line>
I got problems - now everybody on my blocks got 'em<end_line>
I'm screamin like them two cops when Tupac shot 'em<end_line>
Holdin two glocks, hope your doors got new locks on 'em<end_line>
My daughter's feet ain't got no shoes or socks on 'em<end_line>
And them rings you wearin look like they got a few rocks on 'em<end_line>
And while you flauntin 'em I could be takin 'em to shops to pawn 'em<end_line>
I got a couple of rings and a brand new watch, you want 'em?<end_line>
Cause I ain't never went gold off one song<end_line>
I'm runnin up on someone's lawn with guns drawn<end_line>
<verse_end>
