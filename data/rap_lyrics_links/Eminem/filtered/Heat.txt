Lady, you remind me of my raps on that "Relapse" shit<end_line>
Cause you got an ass thick as them accents<end_line>
Two asscheek implants, call that an ass-set<end_line>
Cause you can set a glass on it, it's massive!<end_line>
From the first time I saw you, I actually<end_line>
said to myself, I gotta meet her/meter like a taxi<end_line>
Exactly, love affair/a fare in the back seat<end_line>
Sorry if I'm being graphic<end_line>
But I'm stiff as a statue, you sat on a shelf<end_line>
I feel like I'ma bust, maybe I'm just a-head of myself<end_line>
Let me slow down, slow your Camaro<end_line>
I'm tryna catch up, I'm tryna jump your bones to the marrow<end_line>
Got me under your control and your spell<end_line>
Wanna wrap you up, put you in a bow like an arrow<end_line>
Grab you by thehope it's not a problem, in fact<end_line>
About the only thing I agree on with Donald is that<end_line>
So when I put this palm on your cat - don't snap<end_line>
It's supposed to get grabbed, why you think they call it a snatch?<end_line>
I just wanna climb in the sack<end_line>
I'ma keep it a hundred, like my speedometer's at<end_line>
I'm watchin you rap, I'm the dude followin back<end_line>
about six cars, I'm in the 'lac, and I wanna<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Hate to inconvenience you at the convenience store<end_line>
But them jeans you wore, like I've never seen before<end_line>
I pretend I work there, while I clean the floor<end_line>
Checkin you out like the clerk, while he rings you up<end_line>
Pull up behind you when you're leavin<end_line>
You don't even know it<end_line>
She's brushin her hair, adjustin her mirror<end_line>
She's rappin my shit, but she wasn't aware<end_line>
I was there, or maybe she was, and just didn't care<end_line>
Who knows? Least that ain't up in the air<end_line>
It's somethin to see - so like a chick who thinks her coochie don't stink<end_line>
If she ain't plannin to do shit/douche it, this +Summer's Eve+<end_line>
Maybe she wants to keep me company<end_line>
But fuck the Pep√© Le Pew shit<end_line>
"Ain't steppin to you bitch," I say to myself<end_line>
Plus she's bumpin my music, ain't chasin no tail<end_line>
Like a skunk in heat, I could sweat her, to some degree<end_line>
But fuck it, I'm the male, let her come to me!<end_line>
Let her/letter, come to, me, male/mail<end_line>
Sweat her/sweater heat, some +Degree+, fail<end_line>
Fuck it, pull up beside her<end_line>
Sideswipe her Dodge Viper, wood is so bright<end_line>
I asked if she wants a computer lodged in her vagina<end_line>
Said my dick is an +Apple+, she said put it inside her/in cider!<end_line>
I said<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Black out, come to, hands covered in blood<end_line>
Motherfuckin gloves and a shovel stuck in the mud<end_line>
I just bodied the beat, so that hole must've been dug<end_line>
Cause it just died/dyed like food coloring does<end_line>
So let's get turnt, like a shish-kabob<end_line>
Twist it ma, like an air-conditioning knob<end_line>
We'd be great together, don't care if it takes forever<end_line>
If I gotta wait, I guess it's better late than never<end_line>
You felt my heat, rubbin off on ya<end_line>
I love your personality, c'mon little mama<end_line>
You're hot enough to melt Rick's beat, come jump in the water<end_line>
I bet you get your-self-a-steam, from your per-sauna<end_line>
With an ass to match, girl your<end_line>
body is lit, you're striking, I'm a gas, girl you're<end_line>
just gonna have to put them other chumps on the back burner<end_line>
You got buns, I got Asperger's<end_line>
Just let me rest my head between that set of D's<end_line>
While I shred MC's, like cheddar cheese<end_line>
It's just the thoroughbred in me, ain't a better breed<end_line>
My dog thinks so too, look at my pet agree/+Pedigree+<end_line>
Ma, the world is what I think of you<end_line>
I think you're divine/da vine so, I might swing on you<end_line>
I'm just kiddin girl, I wouldn't lift a finger to<end_line>
'less it's the middle one to finger you<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
On the ones and twos, to three or four in the morning<end_line>
Rick's on the cut like Neosporin<end_line>
He's mixin it up for me and you're in<end_line>
a teddy like short for Theodore and<end_line>
We're outtie, five thousand<end_line>
<verse_end>
