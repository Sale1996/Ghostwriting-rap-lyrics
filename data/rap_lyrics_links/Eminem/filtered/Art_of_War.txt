<verse_start>
By the age of aquarius<end_line>
My mind state was gregarious<end_line>
Various opponents whose stature was hilarious<end_line>
Like you<end_line>
Throwing fairy dust<end_line>
Then frowning hard on whack chorus<end_line>
Proof was on the scene before Nat Morris<end_line>
Cold as a black forest in these starving streets<end_line>
A garbage heap that was brought<end_line>
Stars could eat<end_line>
The nerve of haters<end_line>
Diss us perging gators<end_line>
So I spit venom at you through your serve in vegas<end_line>
The primitive fool again<end_line>
None can match that<end_line>
Blast at your rib cage<end_line>
Making your spine hatch back<end_line>
You lack fat tactics<end_line>
And thoughts of Dexatrim<end_line>
Whippin' my dick out on nuns<end_line>
If they say sex is sin<end_line>
Next to Slim<end_line>
I'm Shady as a Tetris win<end_line>
Dirty Dozen solo are respected men<end_line>
Get known for craft<end_line>
Irritate me like infected skin<end_line>
The future ain't lookin' the same<end_line>
Like a neglected twin<end_line>
Some test the scary<end_line>
That's unnecessary<end_line>
To kill your crew, family, your friends<end_line>
Your tech can carry<end_line>
Knock your paws off sync<end_line>
Left you flat like a soft drink<end_line>
Got more styles than Diana Ross swing<end_line>
Zone like Rick James when he smoke crack<end_line>
You and Charli Baltimore<end_line>
Got something in common<end_line>
Y'all both whack<end_line>
Proof the king P-I-N<end_line>
If I ain't the best this year<end_line>
The motherfucker be my twin<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Chorus 'til fade<end_line>
<verse_end>
