Dre, just let it run<end_line>
Aiyyo turn the beat up a little bit<end_line>

Just shut up and listen, aiyyo..<end_line>

I sit back with this pack of Zig Zags and this bag<end_line>
of this weed it gives me the shit needed to be<end_line>
the most meanest MC on this -- on this Earth<end_line>
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse<end_line>
And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works<end_line>
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve<end_line>
all this tension dispensin these sentences<end_line>
Gettin this stress that's been eatin me recently off of this chest<end_line>
and I rest again peacefully..<end_line>
but at least have the decency in you<end_line>
to leave me alone, when you freaks see me out <end_line>
in the streets when I'm eatin or feedin my daughter<end_line>
to not come and speak to me..<end_line>
I don't know you and no, <end_line>
I don't owe you a mo-therfuck-in thing<end_line>
I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think<end_line>
I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick<end_line>
if you tempt me my tank is on empty..<end_line>
No patience is in me and if you offend me <end_line>
I'm liftin you 10 feet.. in the air <end_line>
I don't care who is there and who saw me destroy you<end_line>
Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit<end_line>
I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe<end_line>
I'm tired of all you..<end_line>
I don't mean to be mean but that's all I can be is just me<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
And I am, whatever you say I am<end_line>
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?<end_line>
In the paper, the news everyday I am<end_line>
Radio won't even play my jam<end_line>
Cause I am, whatever you say I am<end_line>
If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?<end_line>
In the paper, the news everyday I am<end_line>
I don't know it's just the way I am<end_line>
<verse_end>

Sometimes I just feel like my father, I hate to be bothered<end_line>
with all of this nonsense it's constant<end_line>
And, "Oh, it's his lyrical content -<end_line>
- the song 'Guilty Conscience' has gotten such rotten responses"<end_line>
And all of this controversy circles me<end_line>
and it seems like the media immediately<end_line>
points a finger at me..<end_line>
So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie<end_line>
or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up<end_line>
when you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up<end_line>
with the bullshit they pull, cause they full of shit too<end_line>
When a dude's gettin bullied and shoots up his school<end_line>
and they blame it on Marilyn.. and the heroin<end_line>
Where were the parents at?  And look where it's at<end_line>
Middle America, now it's a tragedy<end_line>
Now it's so sad to see, an upper class ci-ty<end_line>
havin this happenin..<end_line>
then attack Eminem cause I rap this way..<end_line>
But I'm glad cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire <end_line>
to burn and it's burnin and I have returned<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I'm so sick and tired of bein admired<end_line>
that I wish that I would just die or get fired<end_line>
and dropped from my label and stop with the fables<end_line>
I'm not gonna be able to top on "My Name is.."<end_line>
And pigeon-holed into some pop-py sensation<end_line>
to cop me rotation at rock'n'roll stations<end_line>
And I just do not got the patience..<end_line>
to deal with these cocky caucasians who think<end_line>
I'm some wigger who just tries to be black cause I talk <end_line>
with an accent, and grab on my balls, so they always keep askin <end_line>
the same fuckin questions..<end_line>
What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in<end_line>
The why, the who what when, the where, and the how<end_line>
'til I'm grabbin my hair and I'm tearin it out<end_line>
cause they drivin me crazy.. I can't take it <end_line>
I'm racin, I'm pacin, I stand and I sit<end_line>
And I'm thankful for ev-ery fan that I get<end_line>
But I can't take a SHIT, in the bathroom<end_line>
without someone standin by it<end_line>
No I won't sign your autograph<end_line>
You can call me an asshole I'm glad<end_line>
<verse_end>
