<verse_start>
you hear the beat<end_line>
as it makes ya<end_line>
not want to go to sleep<end_line>
I knock on Dakota's door<end_line>
it's locked so I go to creep<end_line>
'round the back with binoculars<end_line>
not 'cause I want to peep<end_line>
but because I'm hungry<end_line>
she smells like taco's<end_line>
I want to eat<end_line>
visions of hot choclatey marshmallows<end_line>
also sweet<end_line>
with sugar plums<end_line>
oh look, here comes Marshall he's on your street<end_line>
he's placing hot smoldering charcoals beneath your feet<end_line>
now walk on 'em<end_line>
he's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek<end_line>
like a Thanksgiving turkey<end_line>
a holiday ham<end_line>
see 'em sprinkled on toast<end_line>
with strawberry marmalade jam<end_line>
flavor my favorite graham crackers<end_line>
with Jon Benet Rams<end_line>
I guess a modern day jack the ripper<end_line>
is all that I am<end_line>
My music box<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I almost look comatose<end_line>
who wants to be sober? gross<end_line>
I foam like a doberman<end_line>
mouth open I overdose<end_line>
put coke up my nostrils<end_line>
in both my holes then i plug my nose<end_line>
my pupils quadruple in size<end_line>
my eyes are so bugged I know<end_line>
I put on my mother's make up<end_line>
get naked and run around<end_line>
waving the gun around<end_line>
I think I'm down to a hundred pounds<end_line>
there's thunder, I wonder<end_line>
how come it rains but the sun is out?<end_line>
the Devil's upset with his wife<end_line>
they must be sluggin' it out<end_line>
i must be buggin' the fuck out<end_line>
what the fuck I'm 'bout?<end_line>
voices are leading me up to the attic<end_line>
I love my house<end_line>
they pull and they tug my blouse<end_line>
the sound of a music box<end_line>
comes from inside a toy chest<end_line>
but what do I do it's locked?<end_line>
I pick it and open it<end_line>
but it's stuffed full of human parts<end_line>
I dig 'till I find it, I wind it up<end_line>
and the tune it starts<end_line>
it's playing a song<end_line>
so beautiful and the room is dark<end_line>
the moon is full<end_line>
I smell a funeral guess I'll loom in the park<end_line>
my music box<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I'm fixated<end_line>
on asphyxiating<end_line>
and breakin' this little chick's neck<end_line>
like a pixie stick<end_line>
the sick, satan worshippin'<end_line>
bitches get horse whippin'<end_line>
I'm in the back<end_line>
through the back<end_line>
door slippin'<end_line>
through the crack<end_line>
leavin' the corpse drippin'<end_line>
the mortician of love<end_line>
sent from above<end_line>
forced and treat 'em all<end_line>
when she no more stingy I've become<end_line>
been doing this for more than a quarter century<end_line>
I'm just numb<end_line>
am I dreamin'? is it real?<end_line>
someone pinch me on the buns<end_line>
the time has come<end_line>
to tie her up<end_line>
dada roll me the ladder<end_line>
I've had enough of the chatter<end_line>
climb up to the window look at her<end_line>
the crime is slow to shatter<end_line>
her brain matter and batter her<end_line>
with a bat a matter of fact<end_line>
that will splatter her<end_line>
but before i do that<end_line>
I'll have a chat to flatter her<end_line>
give her two compliments back to back<end_line>
like Tabitha<end_line>
I'm your secret admirer<end_line>
I'm back to ravish ya<end_line>
so strong is your fight<end_line>
but you're no match for Dracula<end_line>
prolonging her plight<end_line>
as I go back to stabbin' her<end_line>
dismember her limbs<end_line>
simple as that cadaver her<end_line>
zoom in with the lens<end_line>
then pan back the camera<end_line>
stand back 'cause here comes your man Jack<end_line>
so Pamela<end_line>
my music box<end_line>
<verse_end>
