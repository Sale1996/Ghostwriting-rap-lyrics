<verse_start>
Everywhere we go people know that we roll deep as fuck<end_line>
Fourty fifty Samoans, they knowing when D-Bo was<end_line>
50, Tweezy, Obie there won't be no hoe in us<end_line>
They pop shit like they gon do shit but no one does<end_line>
From New York down to Texas, back up to Los Angeles<end_line>
We've changed the way we move so man up if you can't adjust<end_line>
You may end up getting rushed by too many to handle us<end_line>
It's funny, I guess money does have its advantages<end_line>
And it isn't that we just think that we can't be touched<end_line>
It's not like we're just feeling ourselves that much<end_line>
It's just, that if someone ever does put us in the clutch<end_line>
We just know that y'all ain't gon be the one who's gon do it<end_line>
Cause first of all you're pussy and everybody can see that<end_line>
You fuck around, get caught in a spot that you shouldn't be at<end_line>
That you got no business being in, we ain't even gon be in it<end_line>
No one's gunna hear nothing, no one's gunna see this shit<end_line>
And they'll be in and up out of it, them boys is bout it, bout it<end_line>
The noise frombe drowned out by the crowd<end_line>
And you'll be laying on the ground getting trampled by people dancing<end_line>
Till the club closes, and clears out<end_line>
And that's when they see you flatened<end_line>
Nobody saw it happen, all cause your jaws are flapping<end_line>
And you couldn't stop yapping and took it past rapping<end_line>
It ain't about the music no more, it's bout trying to show off<end_line>
And it feels like any minute the bomb is bout to go off<end_line>
