You're starin straight into a barrel of hate, terrible fate<end_line>
Not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape<end_line>
Cupid shot his arrow and missed, wait, Sarah you're late<end_line>
Your train left, mascara and egg smear on your face<end_line>
Night's over, goodbye hoe, I thought that I told ya<end_line>
that spilled nut ain't nothin to cry over<end_line>
Never shoulda came within +Range+ of my Rover<end_line>
Should known I was trouble soon as I rolled up<end_line>
Any chick who's dumb enough after I blindfold her<end_line>
She still come back to the crib, must want me to mess with her mind, hold up<end_line>
She mistook me for some high roller when I won't even buy her soda<end_line>
Unless it's Rock & Rye cola<end_line>
Buy you a bag of Fritos? I wouldn't let you eat the fuckin chip on my shoulder!<end_line>
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't dye/die for ya<end_line>
Tryin to pull five bucks from me is like tryin to pull five molars<end_line>
You get your eyes swole up, I'm on my straight grizzly<end_line>
So why would I buy you a gay ass teddy bear bitch? You're already bi-polar!<end_line>

Yeah I guess life is a bitch, ain't it Tip? And each one thinks they the shit<end_line>
Shirt off my back? I wouldn't give you the dirt off my hankerchief<end_line>
I'm givin these hoes a dose of they own medicine, let 'em get a good taste of it<end_line>
I'm sure you got that relationship memo by now but in case you didn't<end_line>
This shit's so bad better stick your nose to your forehead and staple it<end_line>
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wastin it<end_line>
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker, that clock I'm racin it; double timin it<end_line>
but I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time that it may take you pricks<end_line>
to catch on, while you strong-arm like Stretch Armstrong<end_line>
Man I still say K-Mart's like there's an apostrophe-S on it dawg<end_line>
And they say McDonald's isn't a restaurant, well I guess I'm wrong<end_line>
But if you're gonna tell me that A&W ain't the spot for the best hot dogs you can get the F on dawg<end_line>
