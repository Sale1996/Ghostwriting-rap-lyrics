You ain't gon' have no other choice but to rush the stage<end_line>
and charge the mic, and I hope you got the heart to fight<end_line>
Cause you gon' have to, cause you ain't got the smarts to write<end_line>
somethin that good, to try to come back at me with<end_line>
What you gon' do, try to out-rap me with that happy shit?<end_line>
You motherfuckers crack me up<end_line>
Talkin bout you gonna smack me up, y'all won't even back me up<end_line>
Throw up your paws, you pussies can't even scratch me hard<end_line>
It's like fuckin Castor Claw tryna jack me off<end_line>
You think I'm afraid?  What you tryna throw some fear in me?<end_line>
You think I'm dumb enough to roll with no security?<end_line>
I'm doin my best to try to show maturity<end_line>
But don't sit there and stare at me like hoes and sneer at me<end_line>
like it's supposed to be scarin me<end_line>
Like I won't leap clean over this fuckin V.I.P. rope and throw this chair<end_line>
at anyone close or near me tryna approach me physically<end_line>
cause he don't spit lyrically<end_line>
And he knows that my flow's so sick, this hoe's on my dick<end_line>
and he's so sick of hearin me, my posters is starin at him<end_line>
But I don't think he knows the severity<end_line>
of what it could escalate to or that it could grow so seriously<end_line>
if I go hysterically; cause I guarantee<end_line>
there's no one in here that would resort like a childhood<end_line>
any quicker than I would, or hit you with plywood<end_line>
Especially when I'm sippin on this liquor and tonic<end_line>
One swig of this bottle I'ma go upside your head so hard with it<end_line>
the mark from it'll be so dark that it'll leave a scar so big<end_line>
you'll be able to read a label from the motherfuckin<end_line>
sticker that's on it; I'm sick of the nonsense<end_line>
Shit is ridiculous and I refuse to let it get to this point<end_line>
where I'ma let you sit on my conscience - I'm gone bitch, YEAH!<end_line>
