Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?<end_line>
I have; I've been protested and demonstrated against<end_line>
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times<end_line>
Sick as the mind of the motherfuckin kid that's behind<end_line>
all this commotion emotions run deep as ocean's explodin<end_line>
Tempers flarin from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin<end_line>
Not takin nothin from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathin<end_line>
Keep kickin ass in the mornin and takin names in the evenin<end_line>
Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth<end_line>
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out<end_line>
Look at me now; I bet ya probably sick of me now ain't you momma?<end_line>
I'ma make you look so ridiculous now<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Ha! I got some skeletons in my closet<end_line>
and I don't know if no one knows it<end_line>
So before they thrown me inside my coffin and close it<end_line>
I'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73<end_line>
before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin CD<end_line>
I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months<end_line>
My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch<end_line>
cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye<end_line>
No I don't on second thought I just fuckin wished he would die<end_line>
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin her side<end_line>
Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try<end_line>
to make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake<end_line>
I maybe made some mistakes<end_line>
but I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face them today<end_line>
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb<end_line>
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun<end_line>
Cuz I'da killed him; shit I woulda shot Kim and them both<end_line>
It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to "The Eminem Show"<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Now I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition<end_line>
Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissin<end_line>
But put yourself in my position; just try to envision<end_line>
witnessin your momma poppin prescription pills in the kitchen<end_line>
Bitchin that someone's always goin throuh her purse and shit's missin<end_line>
Goin through public housin systems, victim of Munchausen's Syndrome<end_line>
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't<end_line>
'til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach<end_line>
doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma?<end_line>
So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma?<end_line>
But guess what? You're gettin older now and it's cold when your lonely<end_line>
And Nathan's growin up so quick he's gonna know that your phony<end_line>
And Hailie's gettin so big now; you should see her, she's beautiful<end_line>
But you'll never see her - she won't even be at your funeral!<end_line>
See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong<end_line>
Bitch do your song - keep tellin yourself that you was a mom!<end_line>
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get<end_line>
You selfish bitch; I hope you fuckin burn in hell for this shit<end_line>
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me?<end_line>
Well guess what, I +AM+ dead - dead to you as can be!<end_line>
