Original Bad Boy on the case, cover your face<end_line>
Came in the place blowed, and sprayed Puffy with Mase<end_line>
I laced the weed with insect repellant, better check the smelly<end_line>
Eminem starts with E, better check the spelling<end_line>
with a capital, somebody grab me a Snapple<end_line>
I got an aspirin capsule trapped in my adam's apple<end_line>
Somebody dropped me on my head, and I was sure<end_line>
that my mother did it, but the bitch won't admit it was her<end_line>
I slit her stomach open with a scalpel when she was six months<end_line>
and said, "I'm ready now bitch - ain't you feelin these kicks cunt?"<end_line>
The world ain't ready for me yet, I can tell<end_line>
I'll probably have a cell next to the furnace in hell<end_line>
I'm sicker than sperm cells with syphillis germs<end_line>
and I'm hotter than my dick is, when I piss and it burns<end_line>
I kick you in the tummy until you sick to your stomach<end_line>
and vomit so much blood that your clothes stick to you from it<end_line>
 Hit you in the head with a brick til you plummet<end_line>
If y'all don't like me, you can suck my dick til you numb it<end_line>
And all that gibberish you was spittin, you need to kill it<end_line>
Cause your style is like dyin in my sleep, I don't feel it<end_line>

I'm ice grillin you, starin you down with a gremlin grin<end_line>
I'm Eminem, you're a fag in a women's gym<end_line>
I'm Slim, the Shady is really a fake alias<end_line>
to save me with in case I get chased by space aliens<end_line>
A brainiac, with a cranium packed, full of more uranium<end_line>
than a maniac Saudi Arabian<end_line>
A highly combustible head, spazmatic<end_line>
strapped to a Kraftmatic adjustable bed<end_line>
Laid up in the hospital in critical condition<end_line>
I flatlined; jumped up and ran from the mortician<end_line>
High speed, IV full of thai weed<end_line>
Lookin Chinese, with my knees stuck together like siamese<end_line>
twins, joined at the groin like lesbians<end_line>
Uhh, pins and needles, hypodermic needles and pins<end_line>
I hope God forgives me for my sins -- it probably all depends<end_line>
on if I keep on killin my girlfriends<end_line>

Last night I O.D.'d on rush, mushrooms and dust<end_line>
and got rushed to the hospital to get my system flushed<end_line>
 I'm an alcoholic and that's all I can say<end_line>
I call in to work, cause all I do is frolic and play<end_line>
I swallow grenades, and take about a bottle a day<end_line>
of Tylenol 3, and talk about how violent I'll be<end_line>
Give me eleven Excederin my head'll spin<end_line>
Medicine'll get me revvin like a 747 jet engine<end_line>
Scratched my balls til I shredded skin<end_line>
"Doctor, check this rash, look how red it's been"<end_line>
"It's probably AIDS!"  Forget it then<end_line>
I strike a still pose and hit you with some ill flows<end_line>
that don't even make sense, like dykes usin dildos<end_line>
So reach in your billfolds, for ten ducats<end_line>
and pick up this Slim Shady shit that's on Rawkus<end_line>
Somethin somethin somethin, somethin I get weeded<end_line>
My daughter scribbled over that rhyme, I couldn't read it<end_line>
