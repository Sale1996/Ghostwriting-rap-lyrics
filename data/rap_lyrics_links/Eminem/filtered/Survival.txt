<verse_start>
Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared<end_line>
I was prepared to be ILL though, the skill was there!<end_line>
From the beginning it wasn't 'bout the ends<end_line>
It was 'bout bustin raps and standin for somethin, fuckin acronym<end_line>
Cut the fuckin act like you're happy I'm fuckin back again<end_line>
with another anthem, why stop when it doesn't have to end?<end_line>
It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough<end_line>
Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up, I'm afraid of what'll<end_line>
happen to them wolves, when the thought of bein thrown <end_line>
into an alligator pit I salivate at it, wait is up<end_line>
Hands up like it's 12 noon, nah homie, hold them bitches straighter up<end_line>
Wave 'em 'til you dislocate a rotator cuff<end_line>
Came up rough, came to ruffle feathers, nah egos I ain't deflate enough<end_line>
Last chance to make this whole stadium ERUPT - cause<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I can see the finish line with each line that I finish, I'm so close<end_line>
to my goals I can almost pole vault, over the goal post<end_line>
And if I don't got enough in the tank maybe I can just siphon enough<end_line>
to fill up this last can, man will I survive in this climate or what?<end_line>
They said I was washed up and got a blood bath<end_line>
I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter, I can adjust!<end_line>
Plus, I can just walk up to a mic and just bust<end_line>
So, floor's open if you'd like to discuss<end_line>
Top 5 in this muh'fucker and if I don't make the cut, what, like I give a fuck<end_line>
I'ma light this bitch up like I'm drivin a truck<end_line>
through the side of a pump<end_line>
Zero to sixty, hop in and +gun it+ like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hypin 'em UP<end_line>
And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a RUT<end_line>
And I look like I might just give up, ehh, might've mistook<end_line>
me for bowin out, I ain't takin a bow<end_line>
I'm stabbin myself with a fuckin knife in the gut, while I'm wipin my BUTT!<end_line>
Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like gettin CUT!<end_line>
I get excited at the sight of my blood, you're in a fight with a NUT!<end_line>
Cause I'ma fight 'til I die or win, bitin the dust<end_line>
It'll just, make me angrier, wait, let me remind you of what<end_line>
got me this far, picture me quittin<end_line>
Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it slut<end_line>
It's survival of WHAT?<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
So get your ideasstack your ammo<end_line>
But don't come unless you come to battle, now mount up, jump in the saddle<end_line>
This is it, it's what you eat, sleep, piss and shit<end_line>
Live, breathe, your whole existence just consists of this<end_line>
Refuse to quit, fuse is lit, can't defuse the wick<end_line>
I don't do this music shit I'll lose my SHIT!<end_line>
Ain't got shit to lose, it's the moment of truth, it's all I know how to do<end_line>
As soon as I get thrown in the booth, I SPIT!<end_line>
But my respect is overdue, I'm showin you the flow no one do<end_line>
Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I QUIT!<end_line>
So there's nothin for me to fall back on, I know no other trade<end_line>
So you'd better trade your fuckin mics in for some tool-box-es!<end_line>
Cause you'll never take my pride from me, it'll have to be pried from me<end_line>
So pull out your pliers and your screw-dri-vers!<end_line>
But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve<end_line>
Cause this is somethin that I must use to suc-ceed<end_line>
And if you don't like me then FUCK you, self-esteem<end_line>
must be fuckin shootin through the roof, cause trust me<end_line>
My skin is too thick and bullet-proof to touch me<end_line>
I can see why the fuck I disgust you, I must be<end_line>
a-llergic to failure cause every time I come close to it I just sneeze<end_line>
But I just go ah-choo, then A-CHIEVE!<end_line>
<verse_end>
