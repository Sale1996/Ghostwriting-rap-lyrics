Picture me sittin in a jail cell rottin<end_line>
Or barricaded in a motel with twelve shotguns<end_line>
So when thecome knockin each hand's got one<end_line>
Cocked, ready to dump slugs heavy as shotputs<end_line>
One man army, guns can't harm me<end_line>
Young and ornery, worse than my Uncle Ronnie<end_line>
Ever since I got my first gun pulled on me<end_line>
I can't stop airin out my dirty laundry<end_line>
Middle fingers flipped and censorship<end_line>
Your friends just flipped over the swift penmanship<end_line>
Ever since I spit some shit on "Infinite"<end_line>
I been givin it, a hundred and ten percent<end_line>
Cause when I'm bent - most of my energy's spent on enemies<end_line>
Eighty percent of what I invent is Hennessey<end_line>
Twenty percent is from being hungry as sin<end_line>
Ten's because I love being under your skin<end_line>
Yeah shit can happen, so stick to rappin<end_line>
Quit the yappin or I'ma lift the mac and<end_line>
That can lead to another mishap happenin<end_line>
Skip the crap get the can of whoop-ass crackin!<end_line>

1- continues in background<end_line>
It can and it will<end_line>
Fuck around with Amityville and you DIE<end_line>
Insanity spills from the mentality of twelve motherfuckers<end_line>
in six different bodies with their personalities split<end_line>
Fuckin you up with hit after hit<end_line>
Stickin you up with clip after clip<end_line>
Makin you suck dick after dick<end_line>
Dirty motherfuckin dozen<end_line>
The Kon Artis, motherfuckin Peter S. Bizarre<end_line>
Swifty McVay, the Kuniva, Dirty father fuckin Harry<end_line>
Puttin you down in a cemetery, you get buried<end_line>
All you of you motherfuckers suck our motherfuckin cocks!<end_line>
We are not playin, we are not playin<end_line>
We are not bullshittin, this is not a motherfuckin joke!<end_line>
All of you motherfuckers get smoked!<end_line>
