<verse_start>
I'll leave your blueprints covered in shoe prints<end_line>
Poppin' Nuprin<end_line>
Neighborhood nuisance<end_line>
Murder your family for two cent<end_line>
Makin' your crew tense<end_line>
Brain's too dense<end_line>
Leave the mic with two dents<end_line>
Fresher than a whole mouth full of chewed mints<end_line>
Givin' you rude hints<end_line>
Cause if you're wack I'm gonna tell ya<end_line>
I got the issue where they diss in next month's Source I'm gonna mail ya<end_line>
You're a failure<end_line>
You're style's staler than a bowl of hardened rice<end_line>
Scared and sliced<end_line>
I flunked kinder garden twice<end_line>
But you ain't hard and nice<end_line>
And you sure ain't servin' no bids<end_line>
Sayin' you did is like seein' a damn virgin with kids<end_line>
Creepin' like a phantom<end_line>
Holdin' my dick like the +Player's Anthem+<end_line>
Holdin' this microphone for ransom<end_line>
Bitches ask me why do I talk nasty?<end_line>
Grab an ass of every trashy whore that walks past me<end_line>
My crew's on drugs, lookin' like zombies<end_line>
Smokin' bomb trees<end_line>
Racin' police and dodge ?<end_line>
