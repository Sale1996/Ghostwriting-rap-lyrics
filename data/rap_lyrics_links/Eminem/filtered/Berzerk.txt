Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack<end_line>
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch<end_line>
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back<end_line>
That's why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes' on the ra-aaag<end_line>
Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to - kick it!<end_line>
Like a magician, critics I turn to - crickets!<end_line>
Got 'em still on the fence whether to - picket!<end_line>
But quick to get impaled, when I tell 'em - stick it!<end_line>
So sick I'm lookin pale, oh that's my - pig-ment!<end_line>
'Bout to go HAM, ya bish, shout out to - Kendrick!<end_line>
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim - BITCH!<end_line>
The art of emceein mixed with Da Vinci and MC Ren<end_line>
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend - BITCH!<end_line>
Been +Public Enemy+ since you thought P.E. was gym - BITCH!<end_line>

Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it?<end_line>
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced, so I guess it ain't<end_line>
that aftershave or cologne that made 'em just faint<end_line>
Plus I showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint<end_line>
So if love is a chess game, checkmate<end_line>
But girl your body's bangin, jump me in, dang, bang-bang<end_line>
Yessiree Bob, I was thinkin the same thang<end_line>
So come get on this +Kid's Rock+, +Bawitdaba+, dang-dang<end_line>
Pow-p-p-p-pow, chka-pow-chicka-wow-wow!<end_line>
Got ya gal blowin up a val-v-v-val-valve!<end_line>
Ain't slowin down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel-towel!<end_line>
Dumb it down, I don't know how, huh-huh, how how!<end_line>
Least I know that I don't know, question is are you bozos<end_line>
smart enough to feel stupid? Hope so<end_line>
Now hoe<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
And they say that love is powerful as cough syrup in Styrofoam<end_line>
All I know is I fell asleep, and woke up in that Monte Carlo<end_line>
with the ugly Kardashian, Lamar oh<end_line>
Sorry yo we done both set the bar low<end_line>
Far as hard drugs are though<end_line>
that's the past but I done did enough Codeine to knock +Future+ into tomorrow<end_line>
And girl I ain't got no money to borrow<end_line>
But I am tryin to find a way to get you a-loan, CAR NOTE!<end_line>
OHH~! Marshall Mathers<end_line>
Shithead with a potty mouth, get the bar of soap lathered<end_line>
Kangols and Car-heart-less cargoes<end_line>
Girl you're fixin to get your heart broke<end_line>
Don't be absurd ma'am; you bird-brain baby<end_line>
I ain't called anybody "Baby" since Birdman - unless you're a swallow<end_line>
Word Rick? Word man, you heard; but don't be discouraged girl<end_line>
This is YOUR JAM, unless you got TOE JAM<end_line>
