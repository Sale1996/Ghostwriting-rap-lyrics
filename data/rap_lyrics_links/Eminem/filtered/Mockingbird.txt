I know sometimes, things may not always make sense to you right now<end_line>
But hey, what daddy always tell you?<end_line>
Straighten up little soldier - stiffen up that upper lip<end_line>
What you cryin about?  You got me<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Hailie I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad<end_line>
when I'm gone but I'm tryin to give you the life that I never had<end_line>
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh<end_line>
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry<end_line>
Cause you're scared, I ain't there, daddy's with you in your prayers<end_line>
No more cryin, wipe them tears, daddy's here no more nightmares<end_line>
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it<end_line>
Laney, Uncle's crazy ain't he yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it<end_line>
We're all we got it this world, when it spins, when it swirls<end_line>
When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls<end_line>
Lookin puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin you<end_line>
Daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news<end_line>
I try to keep up sheltered from it, but somehow it seems<end_line>
the harder that I try to do that the more it backfires on me<end_line>
All the things growin up as Daddy that he had to see<end_line>
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did<end_line>
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me<end_line>
But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein<end_line>
together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers<end_line>
But then of course everything always happens for a reason<end_line>
I guess it was never meant to be<end_line>
But it's just somethin that we have no control over and that's what destiny is<end_line>
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep<end_line>
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Heh, it's funny<end_line>
I remember back one year when daddy had no money<end_line>
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree<end_line>
and said some of 'em weren't from me, cause daddy couldn't buy 'em<end_line>
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night cryin<end_line>
Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job<end_line>
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom<end_line>
And at the time, every house that we lived in<end_line>
Either kept gettin broken into and robbed or shot up on the block<end_line>
And your mom, was savin money for you in a jar<end_line>
Tryin to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college<end_line>
Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it<end_line>
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart<end_line>
And it seemed like everything was just startin to fall apart<end_line>
Mom and dad was arguin a lot so momma moved back<end_line>
on the Chalmers in the flat, one bedroom apartment<end_line>
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara<end_line>
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD<end_line>
and met Dr. Dre, and flew you and momma out to see me<end_line>
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me<end_line>
Then you started seein daddy on the TV<end_line>
And momma didn't like it, and you and Laney were too young to understand it<end_line>
Papa was a rollin stone, momma developed a habit<end_line>
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it<end_line>
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand<end_line>
Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud<end_line>
Now I'm sittin in this empty house, just reminiscin<end_line>
Lookin at your baby pictures, it just trips me out<end_line>
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now<end_line>
Wow, guess you pretty much are, and daddy's still here<end_line>
Laney I'm talkin to you too, daddy's still here<end_line>
I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it don't it?<end_line>
Shh, momma's only gone for the moment<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
And if you ask me to daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird<end_line>
I'ma give you the world<end_line>
I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you<end_line>
I'll do anything for you to see you smile<end_line>
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine<end_line>
I'ma break that birdie's neck<end_line>
I'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya<end_line>
And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with dad<end_line>
Ha ha! <end_line>
<verse_end>
