<verse_start>
I'm foamin at the mouth, ain't nobody takin me out<end_line>
Every single rapper in the industry, yeah they know what I'm about<end_line>
And I dare you to test me<end_line>
Cause not a single one of you motherfuckers impress me<end_line>
And maybe that's a little bit of an exaggeration<end_line>
But I'm full of innovation<end_line>
And I'm tired of all of this high school "He's cool, he's not" rap shit<end_line>
Can a single one of you motherfuckers even rap? Shit<end_line>
No, this ain't a diss to the game, this a gas to the flame<end_line>
Nowadays, everybody sound the same, shit's lame<end_line>
Like a moth to the flame, I'ma reel 'em in and kill 'em<end_line>
Know you feelin lyricism when I'm spillin it<end_line>
I'm feelin myself, yeah yeah, Bobby Boy, he be feelin himself<end_line>
Mass murder like this can't be good for my health<end_line>
When I rap like this, do I sound like shit?<end_line>
Well, it don't really matter cause I'm killin this shit<end_line>
Yeah I'm killin this shit<end_line>
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I'm killin this shit<end_line>
"Bobby, how many times you been killin this shit?<end_line>
Find another rhyme, goddamn, nigga shit"<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
There's nowhere to hide<end_line>
We call this shit genocide<end_line>
Hit 'em with thatand they die<end_line>
We gon' leave 'em crucified, we call this shit genocide<end_line>
I got bitches, I got hoes<end_line>
I got rare designer clothes<end_line>
No, we ain't fuckin with that<end_line>
Yeah, there's a time and a place but if you ain't comin with the illest of raps<end_line>
Callin yourself the greatest alive<end_line>
Then you don't deserve to do that<end_line>
No no, oh no no, please do not do that<end_line>
You gon' get smacked, you gon' make Bobby attack<end_line>
You gon' make Bobby Boy snap<end_line>
You gon' make Bobby Boy snap<end_line>
Bobby Boy!<end_line>

<verse_start>
Jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga like JAY-Z<end_line>
Jig is up, you fuckers who didn't write anything<end_line>
are getting washed, ligga-ligga-ligga, like bathing<end_line>
Young Hova, I know hitters like Yankees<end_line>
Gun toters that pull triggers like crazy, unloadin<end_line>
Leave you shot up in your Rover<end_line>
Your body goes limp and, slumps over<end_line>
Like A-Rod in a month lull but he just homered<end_line>
... Hold up, I said<end_line>
"Rover" because now your Rover is red<end_line>
Like Red Rover, so you know what I meant<end_line>
But I roll over my opponents instead<end_line>
Makin dog sounds cause I gotta keep breakin these bars down<end_line>
I'll go slow for the speds<end_line>
But when I golike the Dobermann said<end_line>
I still think thewould go over your head<end_line>
Beast mode - motherfuckers 'bout to get hit<end_line>
with so many foul lines, you'll think I'm a free throw<end_line>
Figured it was about time for people to eat crow<end_line>
You about to get out-rhymed, how could I be dethroned?<end_line>
I stay on my toes like the repo<end_line>
A behemoth in sheep clothes from the East Coast<end_line>
to the West, I'm the ethos and I'm the G.O.A.T<end_line>
who the best, I don't gotta say a fuckin thing though cause MC's know<end_line>
But you don't wanna hear me spit the facts, your shit is ass like a tailbone<end_line>
Or you're trapped in your cell phone<end_line>
Or my chicken scratch, or my self-loathe<end_line>
I don't wanna fuckin listen to you spit your raps someone else wrote<end_line>
Used to get beat up by the big kids<end_line>
Used to let the big kids steal my big wheel<end_line>
And I wouldn't do shit but just sit still<end_line>
Now money's not a big deal, I'm rich, I wipe my ass with six mill'<end_line>
Big bills like a platypus<end_line>
A caterpillar's comin to get the cannabis<end_line>
I'm lookin for the smoke but you motherfuckers are scatterin<end_line>
Batterin everything and I've had it with the inadequate<end_line>
Man, I can see my dick is standin stiff as a mannequin<end_line>
And I'm bringin the bandanna back, and the fuckin headband again<end_line>
A handkerchief and I'm thinkin of bringin the fuckin fingerless gloves back<end_line>
And not givin a singular fuck, like fuck rap!<end_line>
I sound like a fuckin millionaire<end_line>
with a Derringer with a hair trigger<end_line>
'Bout to bear hug a fuckin terrier, the Ric Flair dripper<end_line>
Y'all couldn't hold a candle at a prayer vigil<end_line>
When I vent, they compare me to a fuckin air duct<end_line>
I'm about to bare-knuckle it - nah, fuck it<end_line>
I'm gonna go upside their head with a Nantucket, abraca-fuckin-dabra<end_line>
The track is the blood, I'm attracted<end_line>
I'm attackin it, what? Dracula, fuck that shit<end_line>
I'm up, back with a thud<end_line>
Man, stop<end_line>
<verse_end>
