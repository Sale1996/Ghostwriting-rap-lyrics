So I get off stage right and drop the mic<end_line>
Walk up to the hot chicks and I'm all like<end_line>
"Sup ladies? my name's Slim Shady<end_line>
I'm the lead singer in D12 baby"<end_line>
They're all like "Oh my God it's him!"<end_line>
"Becky oh my fucking god it's Eminem!!!"<end_line>
"I swear to fucking God dude you fucking rock!"<end_line>
"Please won't you please let me suck your cock!"<end_line>
And by now, the rest of the fellas get jealous<end_line>
Especially when I drop the beat and do my acapellas<end_line>
All the chicks start yelling, all the hot babes<end_line>
Throw their bras and their shirt and their panties on stage<end_line>
So like every single night they pick a fight with me<end_line>
But when we fight it's kinda like sibling rivalry<end_line>
Cause they're back on stage the next night with me<end_line>
Dude I just think you're trying to steal the light from me<end_line>
Yesterday Kuniva tried to pull a knife on me<end_line>
Cause I told him Jessica Alba's my wife to be<end_line>
This rock star shit, it's the life for me<end_line>
And all the other guys just despise me be<end_line>

<verse_start>
I'm the lead singer of my band<end_line>
I get all the girl's to take off their underpants<end_line>
And the lead singer of my band, my salsa<end_line>
Makes all the pretty girl's want to dance<end_line>
My salsa, look out for my next single it's called 'My Salsa'<end_line>
My salsa, salsa, salsa, salsa, my salsa<end_line>
Makes all the pretty girls want to dance<end_line>
And take off their underpants<end_line>
My salsa makes all the pretty girls wanna dance<end_line>
And take off their underpants, my salsa<end_line>
Where'd everybody go?<end_line>
<verse_end>
