<verse_start>
One thousand different houses and MÃ¼nchausen<end_line>
will make you wanna punch out some-fuckin-one, "Ouch!<end_line>
What the fuck'd you hit me for?" Scream life as I punch counter<end_line>
And bunches out of anger, I once encountered a stranger, in a dumb gown<end_line>
Black hood with a scythe, shit I laughed in his face, spit<end_line>
Bitch gave me an extra life, like "Take this<end_line>
Now get your ass back in that game bitch<end_line>
Don't take shit for granted and don't take shit - give it"<end_line>
Only bull you should take is by the horns, a mixture of Whitey Ford<end_line>
and Mighty Thor, I +Everlast+, pen is mightier than sword<end_line>
Finish writing then record, replenish, keep writing more<end_line>
Nothing's riding on it but your pride, that's all you're fighting for<end_line>
So you fight, scratch, you claw, back's to wall<end_line>
No one was there to catch you fall, you pick yourself back up, you dust your jacket off<end_line>
You grab your balls like they're gargantuan and ask yourself how fuckin bad you want it<end_line>
Pull out your badge for whoopin ass and flash it on 'em<end_line>
Nobody's gonna back you in the corner, you're a hornet<end_line>
No one's more ignorant than you fuckin four in the morning<end_line>
You're at the laboratory, storming like there's nothin that's more important<end_line>
MC's you better consider this a formal warning, you're in for it!<end_line>
Girl what would you do if I said your body was off the +chain+<end_line>
and I told you I smile every single time I +saw+ your face?<end_line>
I ain't finished bitch, I meant in half, oil the blades<end_line>
Nobody wants to play, they say I'm a spoiled lil' baby - but<end_line>

<verse_start>
What goes through an addict's brain? Besides static pain<end_line>
and Big Daddy Kane, great beats and words, an erratic train<end_line>
of thought like splatter paint, scatter brain<end_line>
Yeah, maybe that explains why you're back but don't rap the same<end_line>
And you're lookin way thinner<end_line>
Cause your hunger got you lookin like they took away dinnerSugar Ray Leonard<end_line>
wouldn't sugar coat a fuckin booger though just to wipe that bitch on a hooker's coat<end_line>
When you say you're awhat<end_line>
Now fling that bitch from your fingertips<end_line>
Hope it lands on another rap singer's lips who can't think of shit<end_line>
Anything of wit that's interesting to spit, show who's king of this fuckin English Lit'<end_line>
Let your middle fingers flip on each hand, while extending this shit<end_line>
How low can you go? Lower then Chuck D hoe<end_line>
Hear the bass of this in my voice? Rocky's back, where my Adrian?<end_line>
Nobody's crazy as Shady in an eighty million mile radius<end_line>
I'm what Tom Brady is to the Patriots<end_line>
to rap, not a man, I'm a weapon, who just happened to be a rapper<end_line>
who just happened to be on the crapper<end_line>
When it happened I had an epiphany in the bathroom<end_line>
I'd never be the same after, now I'm back with an appe-<end_line>
-tite for destruction and a fuckin recipe for disaster<end_line>
So let's eat cause I'm famished, every deed is a dastard-<end_line>
-ly one, evilest bastard, even you askin for me to be po-<end_line>
-lite to people, is like me havin my teeth pulled<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
So step inside a dimension - the demented side of a mind that's <end_line>
like the inside of an engine, while I multiply your undivided attention<end_line>
But be reminded if I didn't mention, I'll lose my mind and my temper<end_line>
You'll be the first one who finds I'm offensive<end_line>
Got him climbin the fences, lost some time to addiction<end_line>
But look up "rhyme" in the dictio-nary, I'm in the picture<end_line>
Eminem is the synonym for it, I'm an enigma!<end_line>
Fuck it, let's get to the meat, I'm gonna skip the<end_line>
veg and potatoes, edumacator<end_line>
They are shit legends are made of, spit treacherous data<end_line>
Shit that you would say to<end_line>
your worst enemy, this wretched is, what you get when you mix Treach with a Jada<end_line>
Then combine 'em with Method Man and Redman with metham-<end_line>
-phetamines in each left hand, in each right is a sledgeham-<end_line>
-mer, and pajamas, standin in front of a webcam<end_line>
Beatin themselves in the head 'til Russell lets 'em off Def Jam<end_line>
Maybe I need my head exam'ed, Hannibal Lecter with a dead lamb<end_line>
hangin from his ceiling drippin with a bed pan<end_line>
I need MEDS, swear to God cause if I go off the EDGE<end_line>
T.I. ain't talkin me off the ledge man!<end_line>
Heartthrob at a fart, AHH, nah, more like a smart slob<end_line>
Part blob that'll stab you with a sharp ob-<end_line>
-ject to the heart and leave claw marks all over the Walmart walls<end_line>
Little baby with large BALLS!<end_line>
Fuck mud slingin, I'm blood flingin<end_line>
There's nothing on this fucking Earth better then being the king of<end_line>
the playground, I hate the swings but I love bein<end_line>
an underdog, cause when I'm pushed, I end up swingin<end_line>
