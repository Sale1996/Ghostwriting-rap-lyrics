While you were sipping your own Kool-Aid getting your buzz heavy<end_line>
I was in the fuckin shed sharpenin my machete<end_line>
Sippin on some of that revenge juice, getting my taste buds ready<end_line>
to wolf down this spaghetti, or should I say this spa-GET-EVEN!<end_line>
Think you fuckin meatballs keep on just for-getting<end_line>
Thought he was finished, motherfucker it's only the be-ginning<end_line>
He's buggin again, he's straight thuggin, fuck who he's offending<end_line>
He'll rip your vocal cords out and have them bitches plugged in the<end_line>
motherfuckin wall with 3,000 volts of electricity<end_line>
Now take the other end, dump them then plug them motherfuckers in each<end_line>
one of your eye sockets cause I thought you might finally fuckin see<end_line>
That'll teach you to go voicin your cocksuckin opinion to me!<end_line>
I done put my blood, my sweat and my tears in this shit, FUCK letting up<end_line>
You're gonna end up regretting you ever betted against me<end_line>
Feels like I'ma snap any minute, yeah it's happening again<end_line>
And I'm thinkin about the same, motherfuck everybody that's up in this bitch BUT 50!<end_line>
Cause this is all I know, this is why so hard I go<end_line>
Swear to God I put my heart and soul into this more than anybody KNOWS!<end_line>
I'm trapped so all I do is rap, but every time I rap I'm more trapped<end_line>
And I rap myself right into this bubble, uh-oh guess it's bubble wrap<end_line>
It's like a vicious cycle, my life is in a crisis<end_line>
Christ, how was I supposed to know shit would turn out like it did<end_line>
Feels like I'm goin +Psycho+ again, and I might just blow my lid<end_line>
Shit I almost wish that I would've never made "Recovery" kid<end_line>
Cause I'm runnin in circles with<end_line>
