<verse_start>
Got my self-esteem back, got my confidence up<end_line>
I'ma step up on the stage now, I'm gonna strut<end_line>
And walk around with my pants hangin off of my butt<end_line>
And you ain't 'bout to tell me nothin boy, get off of my nuts<end_line>
It goes one for the money, two for the show<end_line>
My shit don't stink, I don't think so<end_line>
Wipe my ass with the tissue and roll it back up in the roll<end_line>
Are you ready now? Here we go<end_line>
The bald eagle has landed<end_line>
I'm back in your hair, sorry for leavin you stranded<end_line>
I'm twice as dreaded, evil and rancid<end_line>
They can't sit, I don't think anybody understands it<end_line>
Especially when the world's silly putty in your hands it's<end_line>
Play-Doh, I ain't back to play though<end_line>
They said he died in a fatal, car crash, shows what they know<end_line>
Shit if I did, it'd be a trailer not a car, the white trash star<end_line>
I fuck an RV up like Brett Favre!<end_line>
Homie you got it backwards, you're dippin your soup inside your crackers<end_line>
I can carry rap 'til my back hurts<end_line>
Set it down, go right back to the chiropractors<end_line>
Get my back right, then I'm right back on you bastards<end_line>
I was chasin a dragon, I don't know what happened<end_line>
It's like that feelin I had when I first started rappin<end_line>
I just couldn't seem to get back and recapture, that magic<end_line>
So I went back to the lab, that's where I been at when<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I took a hiatus haters, now I'm back to cause trouble<end_line>
Got the fuckin shape of mushroom clouds for thought bubbles<end_line>
I'm theyou ain't fuckin sick, the hospital<end_line>
won't even give you cough drops for coughs cocksucker<end_line>
You think you hot? You ain't even lukewarm<end_line>
My puke's hotter than you, you're soft, I use fire to cool me off<end_line>
I told 'em I'd grow up one day and show 'em<end_line>
I'd be able to choke clouds, pick up lightnin bolts and throw 'em<end_line>
Take the world by storm with these words I form<end_line>
Georgie Porgie kissed the girls, make the girls cry for him<end_line>
Make 'em swarm, make 'em fight over the shirts I've worn<end_line>
Swoon over my sweat towels, it's mind blowin<end_line>
Yes I'm livin the dream homie, can't nothin compare<end_line>
I'm so up, I'm stuck in mid-air, I'm lovin it yeah!<end_line>
It's like these people are steps now, all they do is stair/stare<end_line>
These haters are so pussy they're afraid to be scared!<end_line>
This is payback, like I owe 'em back pay<end_line>
They spat in my face, now I'm back to do them the same exact WAY<end_line>
And leave this rap game with a bad taste<end_line>
And slap it back out before I step back out of this crap, they<end_line>
slap me now I'm slappin 'em back, hey<end_line>
Fuck it we're slap happy, yeah okay now we're talkin some smack ay<end_line>
And I ain't lookin back, in fact they<end_line>
can stare at my ass crack, how's that for hindsight? What the track say?<end_line>
