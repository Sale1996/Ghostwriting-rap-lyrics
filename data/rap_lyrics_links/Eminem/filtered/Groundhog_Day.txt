I used to think I had bad luck, but I wasn't superstitious<end_line>
'til one day I grew suspicious<end_line>
when I stepped on a crack on Aunt Edna's stoop and got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons<end_line>
Then we flew the coop to Michigan to start a new be-ditchin<end_line>
Missouri from Michigan didn't work<end_line>
So we moved back to Missouri from Michigan, from Missouri back to Michigan<end_line>
Someone put me out my misery, I can't do this again<end_line>
Mom please stick to a decision - discipline, last thing I wanna do is listen<end_line>
She's like Lex Luthor bitchin, and rules are Krypto-<end_line>
-nite, so the walls I done lost my power to see through them bitches<end_line>
But I run into 'em, runnin through the kitchen<end_line>
Pretendin to be blind Superman, cause I had no super-vision<end_line>
But I did have a super power though, I could turn into Invisible Kid<end_line>
Disappear outta sight like a true magician<end_line>
And one day Uncle Ronnie brought over this new but different<end_line>
music into the picture and it became my new religion<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Move back to Michigan again, to live with<end_line>
my Grandma Nan, always itchin for somethin to do, was flippin<end_line>
through the radio stations one day and discovered this DJ who was mixin<end_line>
I'll say it to this day, if you ain't listened<end_line>
to The Wizard, you ain't have a fuckin clue what you was missin<end_line>
I'd zone out with my headphones, all I remember doin's wishin<end_line>
for shoes, fuck them stupid Pumas bitch, it's all about them new edition<end_line>
Troops, you get them LL Cool J coolin systems?<end_line>
Think I finally maneuvered to 8 Mile and Hoover and somehow I saw my future is in<end_line>
this, that's how I knew my mission<end_line>
Little boombox boomin, spittin, practicin numerous writtens<end_line>
When I sit in my room envisionin my dreams come to fruition<end_line>
I remember Proof would visit, couldn't wait to play him my new shit he'd go cuckoo ballistic<end_line>
Go through the roof for his shit<end_line>
It's like we knew the instant, we touched a mic that both of us two existed<end_line>
to do this shit, never quit, too persistent!<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Started a group of misfits, Proof had a proposition<end_line>
If we all band together, there ain't no stoppin this shit<end_line>
Come up with aliases, bi-polar opposites and<end_line>
be ready to come off the top with sharp precision<end_line>
If you got dissed at the Shop cause if they caught you slippin<end_line>
They'd take your spot if someone got to rippin you, and you forgot your written<end_line>
Opportunity knocks once, it ain't knockin again<end_line>
It tried ding-dong ditchin shit, I fuckin got that bitch in<end_line>
a headlock, cut off his oxygen Slim<end_line>
It's not budgin like cocksuckin cinder blocks in the wind, now I got a pot to piss in<end_line>
Spot in that top position, coppin over the opposition<end_line>
Lookin like a dog that's pissin, leg up on the competition<end_line>
Promisin complete dominance, Sugar Ray Robinson<end_line>
I'm in the league Muhammad's in, Ali's my colleague, bombin 'em<end_line>
Probably end up on top of 'em, stompin 'em like Ndamukong<end_line>
I'm Russian/rushin like a Ukrainian LaDainian Tomlinson!<end_line>
Flow vomits in your face, competitors fall at my waist<end_line>
You spit a rhyme, I spit in a rhyme's FACE!<end_line>
So name the time, place to battle bitch, I'm still in that mindstate<end_line>
Don't make me step on you and make you whine/wine, grapes<end_line>
Cry babies, maybe my way that I use words<end_line>
is loose but you turds better be careful how you choose yours<end_line>
Cause feelings scar but egos bruise worse<end_line>
And the truth hurts, shit no wonder you're sore losers<end_line>
Now where's your poop, birds? Ooh, no more drippin in bird shit<end_line>
This song's a self-empowerment surgin<end_line>
words of encouragement, but discouragin<end_line>
the rappers, the rap game's God but the name's not James Todd, I'm just a word-Smith<end_line>
So let these words lift<end_line>
Cause all I got is bars for you dumbbells since yours ain't workin out, each verse is<end_line>
more merciless than the first is, and you ain't gotta wear no shoes and shirt<end_line>
in this bitch to get served, bloodthirst, revenge of the nerds<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
And I'm the kid with them ears like Dumbo's gone<end_line>
Word to Uncle Ron, I'm turnin into an non-humble don<end_line>
You blonde dumb hoes, all I got is dick for you to come blow on<end_line>
So start the show but I need a drumroll 'fore I go ON<end_line>
Better back away from the front row, get launched, show you I'm<end_line>
bigger than Dikembe Mutumbo on the fuckin Jumbotron!<end_line>
I'm a juggernaut, you do not wanna rumble, you bomboclaats<end_line>
I'll leave you stretched out like a fuckin YAWN!<end_line>
So mow the fuckin LAWN, your asses are blades of grass<end_line>
And I'm fuckin up this whole landscape of rap!<end_line>
The GOAT just ate eight acres, and eighth of that<end_line>
was just to make a path and take it straight to your favorite rapper!<end_line>
Oh look, my notebook looks smoke cooked<end_line>
Like the flow stood a foot over the flame on the stove soot<end_line>
Charred debris floatin like oak wood<end_line>
was burnin, return of the no good<end_line>
And I won't quit<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
And it don't quit, won't change, it's like a Groundhog's Day<end_line>
So crowd around y'all, cause you may, sayin bye-bye y'all hey<end_line>
I'm a monster, mush - I'm a monster, mush<end_line>
I'm a monster, mush - I'm a, ohh<end_line>
Turnin into a monster, mush<end_line>
I'm a monster, mush - with my<end_line>
<verse_end>
