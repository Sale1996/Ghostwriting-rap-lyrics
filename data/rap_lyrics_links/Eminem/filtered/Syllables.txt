<verse_start>
If we gotta dumb down our style and, A-B-C it<end_line>
then so be it, cause nowadays these kids<end_line>
Jeez, don't give a shit 'bout lyrics<end_line>
All they wanna hear is a beat and that's it<end_line>
Long as they can go to the club and get blitzed<end_line>
Pick up some chicks and get some digits<end_line>
And the DJ's playin them hits<end_line>
"Oh this my jam, this my shit!<end_line>
We don't know a word to a verse, all we know is the chorus<end_line>
Cause the chorus repeats the same four words for us"<end_line>
And the song's ginormous, the whole formula's switched<end_line>
cause we don't know anymore what are hits<end_line>
Is it the beat? Is it the rap?<end_line>
Is it a finger snap or the same 8-0-8 clap?<end_line>
And how do we adapt and get TRL votes<end_line>
when 13-year olds control the remotes?<end_line>
And Ashlee's got a brand new nose<end_line>
We gotta put some new em-phas-is on our syl-la-lables<end_line>
