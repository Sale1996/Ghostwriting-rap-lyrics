<verse_start>
I want you, to understand somethin<end_line>
That when I come up in this bitch I want the fans jumpin<end_line>
I want their fists pumpin in the air, I don't look like a millionaire<end_line>
But I feel like a million bucks; ladies won't ya fill your cups<end_line>
Shady's come to feel ya up, are you a D or a C cup?<end_line>
You could even be a B, it's just me and D-R-E<end_line>
You'll be in the E.R., we are strapped with so much T.N.T.<end_line>
We may blow, no not even C.P.R. from the E.M.T.'s<end_line>
could help you to resuscitate, you busters must be flustered, wait<end_line>
You can't cut the mustard, what's your problem? Can't you bust a grape?<end_line>
What's my name? Shady came and just crushed the game<end_line>
It's really not even fair to them, cause they pale in comparison<end_line>
So much they might as well wear his skin, don't ya wish you could just share his pen?<end_line>
Cause this shit's gettin embarrassin, the fog is thick and the air is thin<end_line>
Cause he won't even let them try to breathe, la-didi-da-da-da-didi<end_line>
He makes it look so easy, girl you just hit the lottery<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
This is when shit hits the fan, like it just splattered on Stan<end_line>
This is the only moment that matters; your homie rolled in with Mathers<end_line>
Now chaos erupts, Em's in back, Dre's in the front<end_line>
So do what we say at once, this song's like a s√©ance, it haunts<end_line>
It's like the playoffs, just makin sure that we stay in the hunt<end_line>
Take a day off for what? Man you better lay off the blunts<end_line>
You must be smokin somethin you think I ain't smokin nothin, stay off my nuts<end_line>
Now hit the flo' baby, time to wipe away all the rust<end_line>
Shake all them cobwebs loose, loosen up with a little bit of Grey Goose<end_line>
Yeah girl shake that caboose, I don't wanna see you try to make no excuse<end_line>
D-R-E is on the loose, a mongoose when it comes to the chronic use<end_line>
You know I can't stand to lose, me and my goons are like animals<end_line>
We come through like a pack of wolves, and we came here to retract the roof<end_line>
Yeah man ain't that the truth, girl your man's back in the booth<end_line>
Definitely back up in this bitch, and this is when all hell breaks loose<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Now I know you're feelin discouraged but homie just mark my words<end_line>
I'm mur-durin the flow, liquid courage I'm finna blow<end_line>
As soon as we hit the do' power surges head to toe<end_line>
I'm sure to push it as far as words are meant to go<end_line>
We're in the indigo Winnebago with tinted windows<end_line>
Ferocious as we proceed to beat up the block wit yo' hoe<end_line>
With speakers knockin it's 3 o'clock<end_line>
Me and Doc then proceed to drop E and hop out the vehicle and knock on your do'<end_line>
<verse_end>
