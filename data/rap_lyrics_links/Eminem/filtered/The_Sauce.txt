<verse_start>
Comin' up, it never mattered what color you was<end_line>
If you could spit, then you could spit<end_line>
That's it, that's what it was<end_line>
Back when, motherfuckers was straight backpackin'<end_line>
Cipherin', fightin' for life in this rap<end_line>
For the mic to get past, and you psyched and you gassed<end_line>
Then you hype, cuz you last<end_line>
And you might whoop some ass<end_line>
If you lost, then you lost<end_line>
Shake hands like a man and you swallowed it<end_line>
When the Unsigned Hype column in The Source was like<end_line>
Our only source of light<end_line>
When the mics used to mean something, a four was like<end_line>
You were the shit, now it's like the least you get<end_line>
Three and a half now just means you're a piece of shit<end_line>
Four and a half or five<end_line>
Means you're Biggie, Jigga, Nas, or Benzino<end_line>
Shit I don't even think you realize<end_line>
You're playing with motherfuckers' lives<end_line>
I done watched Dre get fucked on The Chronic<end_line>
Probably cuz I was on it<end_line>
Now you fucked me out of my mics twice, I let it slide<end_line>
I said I wouldn't hold my fuckin breath to get a five<end_line>
Shit I was right, I'da fuckin died already tryin<end_line>
I swear to God, I never lie, I bet that's why<end_line>
You let that bitch give me that bullshit review<end_line>
I sat and took it, I ain't look at the shit, we knew<end_line>
You'd probably try and fuck us with Obie and 50 too<end_line>
*Hock spit*, fuck a relationship we through<end_line>
No more Source for street cred, them days is dead<end_line>
Ray's got AK's to Dave Mays' head<end_line>
Every issue there's an eight page Made Men spread<end_line>
Will somebody please tell whoever braids his head<end_line>
That I am not afraid of this fuckin waste of lead<end_line>
On my pencil, for me to write some shit this simple<end_line>
So listen closely, as I break it down and proceed<end_line>
This old G's about to get smoked like rolled weed<end_line>
You don't know me or my motherfucking mother<end_line>
You motherfucking punk<end_line>
Put me on your fuckin cover just to sell your little<end_line>
Sell-out mag, I ain't mad, I feel bad<end_line>
Here's an ad, here's a poster of Ray-Ray and his dad<end_line>
You wanna talk about some shit that you don't know about, yea?<end_line>
Let's talk about how you're puttin your own son out there<end_line>
To try to eat off him because you missed your boat<end_line>
You're never gonna blow, bitch, you're just too old<end_line>
No wonder you're sore now, lordy you're bored now<end_line>
I'm pushing thirty, you're kickin forty's door down<end_line>
Bitch this is war now, and you'll never beat me<end_line>
All you do is cheat me out of Quotables<end_line>
But you know that you'll always see me<end_line>
On your TV, cuz you've got to stay up 'til<end_line>
Three in the morning to see your video played once on BET<end_line>
So, hee hee hee, who has the last laugh? Aftermath, yea<end_line>
So on behalf of our whole staff, kiss our asshole cracks<end_line>
We'll never fold or hold back, just know that<end_line>
Benzino's wack, no matter how many times I say his name<end_line>
He'll never blow jack<end_line>
You're better off tryin to bring RSO back<end_line>
Look at your track record, that's how far it goes back<end_line>
It's extortion, and Ray owns a Porsche and<end_line>
So half of the staff up there is fresh out of jail from Boston<end_line>
Bullyin and bossin Dave like a slave<end_line>
They completely brainwashed him and forced him to stay<end_line>
Locked in his own office<end_line>
Afraid of the softest, fakest, wannabe gangsta in New York<end_line>
And it's pitiful, cuz I would have never said shit if you'da<end_line>
Kept your mouth shut, bitch, now what?<end_line>
Hit it Clue, spit it Slay, new shit, exclusive<end_line>
Yo Lantern, yo Who Kid, you know what to do with this<end_line>
Use it, I'm through, this is stupid<end_line>
I can't believe I stooped to this bullshit to do this<end_line>
And who you callin a bitch... bitch?<end_line>
You OWE me<end_line>
