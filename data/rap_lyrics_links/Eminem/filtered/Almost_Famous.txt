<verse_start>
I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist they call me Slim Roethlisberger<end_line>
I go bezerker than a fed-up post-office worker<end_line>
A mark her with a Mossberg I'm pissed off get murdered<end_line>
Like someone took a ketchup squirter squirted a frankfurter<end_line>
For a gangster you sure did shit your pants<end_line>
When you saw the chainsaw get to waving<end_line>
Like a terrible towel<end_line>
I faced her around but his fangs come out<end_line>
Get your brains blown out that's what I call <end_line>
blowing your mind When I come-back<end_line>
Like nut on your spine I'm a thumb tack<end_line>
That you slept on son<end_line>
Now here I come screaming attack like I just stepped on one<end_line>
Low on the totem till he showed 'em<end_line>
Defiance, giant scrotum<end_line>
He don't owe them bitches shit<end_line>
His britches, he out grow'd em<end_line>
He's so out cold he's knocked out of the South Pole<end_line>
And nobody fucks with him<end_line>
Rigamortis and post-mortem<end_line>
He's dying of boredom<end_line>
Take your best rhymes, record 'em<end_line>
Then try to flaunt 'em<end_line>
He'll just take your punch lines and snort 'em<end_line>
Shit stained drawers<end_line>
You gon fuck with a guy who licks the blades of his chainsaws<end_line>
While he dips 'em in P.F. Chang's sauce<end_line>
Game's up, homie, hang it up like some crank calls<end_line>
You think I'm backing down you must be out of your dang skulls<end_line>
I'm almost famous<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I'm back for revenge<end_line>
I lost a battle that ain't happening again<end_line>
I'm at your throat like strep I step, strapped with a pen<end_line>
Metaphors wrote on my hand<end_line>
Some are just stored in my mem-ory<end_line>
Some I wrote on a napkin I do what I have to to win<end_line>
Pullin out all stops, any who touch a mic prior's<end_line>
Not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Meyers<end_line>
And tell that psycho to pass the torch<end_line>
To the whacko fore I take a shit in his Jack-O-Lantern<end_line>
And smash it on his porch<end_line>
Now get off my dick Dick's too short a word for my dick<end_line>
Get off my antidisestablishmentarianism, you prick<end_line>
You call me the champ; call me the space shuttle destroyer<end_line>
I just blew up the challenger, matter fact I need a lawyer<end_line>
I just laced my gloves with enough plaster to make a cast <end_line>
beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like Verne Troyer<end_line>
Y'all are Eminem backwards, you're mini-mes<end_line>
See he's in a whole nother weight class<end_line>
Hes slugs your BB's your bean bag bullets<end_line>
You're full of it; you were just in his CD's<end_line>
Left at Infinite, now he's back like someone pissed in his wheaties<end_line>
No peace treaties, he's turned into a beast<end_line>
His new Slim Shady EP's got the attention of the mighty D. R. E<end_line>
He's almost famous<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Now there he goes in Dre's studio cuppin his balls<end_line>
Screaming the wood off the panel and cussing the paint off the walls<end_line>
Spewing his hate to these haters, showing no love for these broads<end_line>
He ain't given them shit, he says he'll pinch a penny so hard<end_line>
He'll leave a bruise on the bronze so dark you can see the mark<end_line>
With the scars, till Abraham Lincoln is screaming out AHH<end_line>
These metaphors and similes ain't similar to them, not at all<end_line>
If they don't like it, they can all get fucked instead of sucking him off<end_line>
They can go get a belt or a neck tie, to hang themselves by<end_line>
Like David Carradine they can go fuck themselves and just die<end_line>
And eat shit while they at it he's fucking had it, he's mad at the whole world<end_line>
So go to hell and build a snowman girl<end_line>
The bullies become bullied, and pussies get pushed<end_line>
Then they better pull me, take me back to 9th grade to school me<end_line>
Cus I ain't looking back, only forward, this whole spot blowing<end_line>
Who coulda known he'd grow to be a poet and not know it<end_line>
And while I'm being poetic let me get historic and raise the bar<end_line>
Higher than my opinion of these winners and lords<end_line>
So bare witness to some biblical shit<end_line>
As a cold wind blowing this world ain't gonna know what hit it<end_line>
He did it, he made it, he's finally famous<end_line>
<verse_end>
