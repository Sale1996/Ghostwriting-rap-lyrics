<verse_start>
Aight c'mon, let's cut the bullshit enough, let's get it started<end_line>
Let's start addressin this issue and open it up<end_line>
Let's take this shit back to the basement and we can discuss<end_line>
statements that's made on this tape and this whole origin of<end_line>
the music that we all know and love, the music we all enjoy<end_line>
The music you accuse me of tryin to destroy<end_line>
Let's rewind it to eighty-nine, when I was a boy<end_line>
On the Eastside of Detroit, crossin 8 Mile into Warren<end_line>
In the hick territory, I'd like to share a story<end_line>
This is my story, and can't nobody tell it for me<end_line>
You have well informed me, and I'm well aware<end_line>
that I don't belong here, you've made that perfectly clear<end_line>
I get my ass, kicked damn near everywhere<end_line>
From Bel-Air Shoppin Center just for stoppin in there<end_line>
From the black side all the way to the white side<end_line>
Okay there's a bright side, a day that I might slide<end_line>
You may call it a pass, I call it haulin my ass<end_line>
Through that patch of grass over them railroad tracks<end_line>
Oh them railroad tracks, them old railroad tracks<end_line>
The good old notorious, so well known tracks<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I'd roam in the streets so much, they'd call me a drifter<end_line>
Sometimes I'd stick up a thumb just to hitchhike<end_line>
Just to get picked up, to get me a lift to<end_line>
8 Mile and Van Dyke, or steal a God damn bike<end_line>
From somebody's backyard, and drop it off at the park<end_line>
That was the halfway mark, to me Kim had to walk<end_line>
Back to her momma's, from Chalmers, after dark<end_line>
To sneak me in the house, when I'm kicked out my mom's<end_line>
That's about the time, I first met Proof with Goofy<end_line>
Gary on the steps at Osbourne, handin out some flyers<end_line>
We was doin some talent shows at Centerline High<end_line>
I told him to stop by and check us some time<end_line>
He looked at me like I'm out my mind<end_line>
Shook his head, like white boys don't know to rhyme<end_line>
I spit out a line, and rhymed birthday with first place<end_line>
And we both had the same rhymes that sound alike<end_line>
We was on the same shit, that Big Daddy Kane shit<end_line>
With compound syllables sound combined<end_line>
From that day we was down to ride<end_line>
Somehow we knew we'd meet again somewhere down the line<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
My first year of ninth grade, can't forget that day of school<end_line>
It was cool, 'til your man MC Shan came through<end_line>
And said that "Puma's the brand, cause the Klan makes Troops"<end_line>
It was rumors, but man, God damn, they flew<end_line>
Must have been true, because man, we done banned they shoes<end_line>
I had the new ones, the Cool J, ice lamb, suede too<end_line>
But we just threw them in the trash, like they yesterday's news<end_line>
Guess who came through next, X-Clan debuted<end_line>
+Professor X+exist in a state of<end_line>
+red, black, and green with a KEY, SISSIES!+<end_line>
Now with this bein the new trend, we don't fit in<end_line>
Crackers is out, with "Cactus Albums," blackness is in<end_line>
African symbols and medallions, represent black power<end_line>
And we ain't know what it meant, me and my man Howard<end_line>
and Butter would go to the mall<end_line>
with them all over our necks like we're showin 'em off<end_line>
Not knowin at all we was bein laughed at<end_line>
"You ain't even half black; you ain't 'posed to have that<end_line>
 homey, let me grab that, and that Flava Flav clock<end_line>
 we gon' have to snatch that," all I remember is meetin back at<end_line>
Manics's basement, sayin how we hate this<end_line>
How racist but dope the X-Clan's tape is<end_line>
Which reminds me, back in eighty-nine me<end_line>
and Kim broke up for the first time, she was tryin to two-time me<end_line>
And there was this black girl at our school who thought I was cool<end_line>
cause I rapped, so she was kinda eyein me<end_line>
And oh, the irony, guess what her name was<end_line>
Ain't even gonna say it plus, the same color hair as hers was<end_line>
And blue contacts, and a pair of jugs<end_line>
The bombest God damn girl in our whole school<end_line>
If I could pull it, not only would I become more popular<end_line>
But I would be able to piss Kim off at the same time<end_line>
But it backfired, I was supposed to dump her<end_line>
But she dumped me for this black guy, and that's the last I<end_line>
ever seen or heard or spoke to the "Ol' Foolish Pride" girl<end_line>
But I've heard people say they heard the tape, and it ain't that bad<end_line>
But it was, I singled out a whole race<end_line>
And for that I apologizeI was wrong<end_line>
Cause no matter what color a girl is she's still a ho<end_line>
<verse_end>
