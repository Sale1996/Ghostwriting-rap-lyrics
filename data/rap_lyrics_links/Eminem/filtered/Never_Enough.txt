<verse_start>
There's not much you could do or say to phase me<end_line>
People think I'm a little bit crazy<end_line>
I get it from all angles, even occasionally Doc Drezy'll<end_line>
have to step in every once in a while to save me<end_line>
To make me stop and think about it 'fore I just say things<end_line>
Sometimes I forget what other people just may think<end_line>
A lot of rappers probably wouldn't know how to take me<end_line>
If they heard some shit I layed to tape 'fore they erase me<end_line>
I may be a little too fast-paced and racy<end_line>
Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me<end_line>
twenty times cause I say so many rhymes it may seem<end_line>
like I'm going too fast cause my mind is racing<end_line>
And I could give a fuck what category you place me<end_line>
Long as when I'm pushin up daisies and gone<end_line>
As long as you place me amongst one of them greats<end_line>
When I the heavenly gates, I'd be cool beside Jay-Z<end_line>
For every single die-hard fan who embrace me<end_line>
I'm thankful for the talent in which God gave me<end_line>
And I'm thankful for the environment that he placed me<end_line>
Believe it or not, I thank my mom, far as she raised me<end_line>
in a neighborhood daily that jumped and chased me<end_line>
It only made me, what I am today see<end_line>
Regardless of what anybody believes who hates me<end_line>
You ain't gonna make or break me<end_line>
Tryin to strip me of my credibility or make me look fake G<end_line>
You're only gonna be in for a rude awakening<end_line>
Cause sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me<end_line>
And when you face me with all the shit you've been savin<end_line>
to say to me, you had all this time to think about it<end_line>
Now don't pussy out, and try to about face me<end_line>
Cause I've been patiently waitin for the day<end_line>
that we finally meet, in the same place to see<end_line>
