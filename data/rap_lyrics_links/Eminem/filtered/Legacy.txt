I used to be the type of kid that, would always think the sky is fallin<end_line>
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a Martian?<end_line>
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in?<end_line>
Cause I don't belong in this world, that's why I'm scoffin<end_line>
at authority, defyin often, flyin off at<end_line>
the handle at my mom, no dad, so I am non-com-<end_line>
-pliant at home, at school, I'm just shy and awkward<end_line>
And I don't need no goddamn psychologist<end_line>
tryin to diagnose why, I have all these underlyin problems<end_line>
thinkin he can try and solve 'em, I'm outside chalkin<end_line>
up drawings on the sidewalk and in the front drive talkin<end_line>
to myself, either that or inside hidin off in<end_line>
the corner somewhere quiet, tryin not to<end_line>
be noticed cause I'm cryin and sobbin<end_line>
I had a bad day at school so I ain't talkin<end_line>
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fuckin locker cause he said that I eyeballed him<end_line>

I used to be the type of kid that, would always think the sky is fallin<end_line>
Why am I so differently wired, in my noggin?<end_line>
Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind-bogglin<end_line>
Cause I obsess on everything, in my mind small shit<end_line>
bothers me but not my father, he said "Sayonara"<end_line>
then split, but I don't give a shit, I'm fine long as<end_line>
there's batteries in my Walkman<end_line>
Nothin's the matter with me, shit look on the bright side, least I ain't walkin<end_line>
I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment<end_line>
complex on a ten-speed, which I've acquired parts that<end_line>
I find in the garbage, a frame, then put tires on it<end_line>
Headphones on, look straight ahead if kids try and start shit<end_line>
But if this is all there is for me, life offers<end_line>
Why bother even tryin to put up a fight? It's nonsense<end_line>
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience<end_line>
What about them rhymes I've been jottin? They're kinda givin me confidence<end_line>
Instead of tryin to escape through my comics<end_line>
Why don't I just blast a little somethin like Onyx<end_line>
to put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that<end_line>
say what I wanna say to that kid that said that I eyeballed him?<end_line>
Grab hold of my balls like "That's right, fight's on bitch!"<end_line>
Who woulda knew from the moment I turned the mic on that<end_line>
I could be iconic, in my conquest?<end_line>
That's word to Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest<end_line>

I used to be the type of kid that, would always think the sky is fallin<end_line>
Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome<end_line>
Cause if I wasn't I wouldn't be able to work words like this<end_line>
and connect lines like crosswords<end_line>
And use my enemy's words as strength, to try and draw from<end_line>
and get inspired off 'em<end_line>
Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit<end_line>
by you wack fuckin giant sacks of lyin dog shit!<end_line>
Now you shut up bitch, I am talkin!<end_line>
Thought I was full of horse shit and now you fuckin worship the ground on which I am walkin<end_line>
Me against the world, so what? I'm Brian Dawkins<end_line>
versus the whole 0-and-16 Lions' offense!<end_line>
So bring on the Giants, Falcons and Miami Dolphins<end_line>
It's the body-bag game bitch, I'm supplyin coffins<end_line>
Cause you +Dicks Butt-kiss+, a bunch of Brian Balding-<end_line>
-ers, you're gon' die a ball-licker, I've been diabolic-<end_line>
-al with this dialogue since '99 Rawkus<end_line>
You don't respect the legacy I leave behind y'all can<end_line>
suck a dick, the day you beat me pigs'll fly out my ass in a flyin saucer<end_line>
full of Italian sausage!<end_line>
The most high exalting and I ain't halting<end_line>
'til I die of exhaustion, inhale my exhaust fumes!<end_line>
The best part about me, is I am not you<end_line>
I'm me, and I'm the Fire Marshall<end_line>
And this is my<end_line>
