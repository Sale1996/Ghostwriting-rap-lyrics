<verse_start>
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it, got a fat knot from that rap profit<end_line>
Made a livin and a killin off it, ever since Bill Clinton was still in office<end_line>
with Monica Lewinsky feelin on his nut-sack, I'm an MC still as honest<end_line>
But as rude and as indecent as all hell, syllables, skill-a-holic - kill 'em all with<end_line>
this flippity dippity hippity hip-hop, you don't really wanna get into a pissin match with this rappidy rap<end_line>
Packin a Mac in the back of the Ac', backpack rap crap, yap-yap yackety-yack<end_line>
And at the exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts, while I'm practicin that<end_line>
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin table over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half<end_line>
Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact<end_line>
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack<end_line>
Rappers are havin a rough time period, here's a maxi pad<end_line>
It's actually disastrously bad, for the wack while I'm masterfully constructin this masterpiece yeah<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Well to be truthful the blueprint's, simply rage and youthful excuberance<end_line>
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance<end_line>
Hit the Earth like an asteroid and did nothin but shoot for the moon since<end_line>
MC's get taken to school with this music cause I use it<end_line>
as a vehichle to +Bus-the Rhyme+, now I +Lead a New School+ full of students<end_line>
Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N.-<end_line>
-W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim<end_line>
inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up and be in a position<end_line>
to meet Run-D.M.C. and induct them into the motherfuckin Rock 'N<end_line>
Roll Hall of Fame, even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames<end_line>
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alco-hol of fame on the wall of - shame<end_line>
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I +Walk-a Flock-of Flames+<end_line>
off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin?<end_line>
Little gay lookin boy, so gay I can barely say it with a straight face lookin boy<end_line>
You're witnessin a massacre/mass-occur like you're watchin a church gatherin take place lookin boy<end_line>
"Oy vey, that boy's gay," that's all they say lookin boy<end_line>
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back and a "way to go" from your label every day lookin boy<end_line>
Hey lookin boy, what ya say lookin boy? I get a "hell yeah" from Dre lookin boy<end_line>
I'ma work for everything I have, never asked nobody for shit, get out my face lookin boy<end_line>
Basically boy, you're never gonna be capable of keepin up with the same pace lookin boy<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omni-potent<end_line>
Let off then I'm reloadin immediately with these bombs I'm totin<end_line>
And I should not be woken<end_line>
I'm the walkin dead but I'm just a talkin head, a zombie floatin, but I got your mom deep-throatin<end_line>
I'm out my Ramen noodle, we have nothin in common poodle<end_line>
I'm a Doberman, +Pinsch'+ yourself in the arm and pay homage pupil<end_line>
It's me, my honesty's brutal<end_line>
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though<end_line>
for good at least once in a while<end_line>
so I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle<end_line>
enough rhymes to, maybe try to help get some people through tough times<end_line>
But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case, cause even you unsigned<end_line>
rappers are hungry lookin at me like it's lunchtime<end_line>
I know there was a time where once I<end_line>
was king of the underground but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind<end_line>
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes, when you combine<end_line>
appeal with the skin color of mine, you get too big and here they come tryin<end_line>
to censor you like that one line I said on "I'm Back" from the Mathers LP 1 when I<end_line>
tried to say I'll take seven kids from Columbine<end_line>
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine<end_line>
See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm<end_line>
morphin into an immortal comin through the portal<end_line>
You're stuck in a timewarp from 2004 though<end_line>
And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for, you're<end_line>
pointless as Rapunzel with fuckin, cornrows<end_line>
You write normal, fuck being normal<end_line>
And I just bought a new ray gun from the future just to come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad<end_line>
Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad singin to a man while he played piano<end_line>
Man oh man, that was the 24/7 special on the cable channel<end_line>
So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day, "Hey Fab<end_line>
I'ma kill you!" Lyrics comin at you at +Supersonic+ speed - J. J. Fad<end_line>
Uhh, samma lamma dooma lamma, you assumin I'm a human, what I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman?<end_line>
Innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin off of me and it'll glue to you and<end_line>
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating how to give a motherfuckin audience a feelin like it's levitating<end_line>
Never fading and I know the haters are forever waiting for the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating<end_line>
Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated, I make elevating music, you make elevator music<end_line>
"Oh, he's too mainstream!" Well that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it<end_line>
"It's not hip-hop, it's pop!" Cause I found a hella way to fuse it<end_line>
with rock, shock-rap with Doc, throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it<end_line>
"I don't know how to make songs like that, I don't know what words to use"<end_line>
Let me know when it occurs to you while I'm rippin any one of these verses that versus you<end_line>
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin you; how many verses I gotta murder to<end_line>
prove that if you were half as nice at songs you can sacrifice virgins too?<end_line>
Unhh~! School flunky, pill junkie<end_line>
But look at the accolades these skills brung me, full of myself, but still hungry<end_line>
I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to and I'm a, million leagues above you<end_line>
Ill when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you<end_line>
I'm drunk, so Satan take the fuckin wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat<end_line>
Bumpin Heavy D and the Boys, still +Chunky But Funky+<end_line>
But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling<end_line>
Angels fight with devils and, here's what they want from me<end_line>
They're askin me to eliminate some of the women hate, but if you take into consideration the bitter hatred<end_line>
I have then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation and understand the discrimination<end_line>
But fuck it, life's handin you lemons, make lemonade then<end_line>
But if I can't batter the women, how the fuck am I supposed to bake 'em a cake then?<end_line>
Don't mistake him for Satan<end_line>
It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation<end_line>
to trip a-broad, and make her fall on her face and<end_line>
don't be a retard - be a king? Think not<end_line>
Why be a King, when you can be a God?<end_line>
<verse_end>
