It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder<end_line>
Why I keep on duckin' under the bed when I hear thunder<end_line>
Cuz I ain't crazy, I say shit that's crazy to crazy people<end_line>
To make 'em believe I'm crazy so they can relate to me<end_line>
And maybe believe in Shady so they can be evil baby<end_line>
I like that!  I'm only as crazy as people made me<end_line>
Believe me, there'll be just as many muthafuckin' murderers<end_line>
And heroin users without Marlilyn's music<end_line>
But I figure I make my music I don't care if you use it<end_line>
To murder somebody, I just wanna be there when you do it!<end_line>
Now the parents are suein' cuz little Darren is screwin'<end_line>
Karen and Susan cause I told him to do it on Clue's new shit<end_line>
Now it's all ruined, the whole world is fucked up<end_line>
Cuz of me?  Two 12-year old girls is knocked up<end_line>
My attitude's 'fuck it' like Pac's was at one point<end_line>
Wanna come join?  Pick up a glock and just point<end_line>
Now everybody's killin' everybody and everybody's bloody<end_line>
And I'm just laughin' like it's funny<end_line>
Cause I don't really give a shit about no-muthafuckin'-body<end_line>
I'm so muthafuckin' nutty I don't give a fuck about nuttin'!<end_line>
