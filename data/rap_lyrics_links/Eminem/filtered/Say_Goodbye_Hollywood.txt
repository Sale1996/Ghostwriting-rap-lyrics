I thought I had it all figured out, I did<end_line>
I thought I was tough enough to stick it out with Kim<end_line>
But I wasn't tough enough to juggle two things at once<end_line>
I found myself layin on my knees in cuffs<end_line>
which shoulda been a reason enough, for me to get my stuff<end_line>
and just leave - how come I couldn't see this shit myself?<end_line>
It's just me, nobody couldn't see the shit I felt<end_line>
Knowin damn well she wasn't gonna be there when I fell<end_line>
to catch me, the minute shit was heated, she just bailed<end_line>
I'm standin here swingin like thirty people by myself<end_line>
I couldn't even see the millimeter when it fell<end_line>
Turned around saw Gary stashin the heater in his belt<end_line>
Saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground<end_line>
I just sold two million records, I don't need to go to jail<end_line>
I'm not about to lose my freedom over no female<end_line>
I need to slow down, try to get my feet on solid ground, so for now I'm..<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I bury my face in comic books, cause I don't want to look<end_line>
at nothin, this world's too much, I've swallowed all I could<end_line>
If I could swallow a bottle of Tylenol I would<end_line>
And end it for good, just say goodbye to Hollywood<end_line>
I probably should, these problems are pilin all at once<end_line>
Cause everything that bothers me, I got it bottled up<end_line>
I think I'm bottomin out, but I'm not about to give up<end_line>
I gotta get up, thank God, I got a little girl<end_line>
And I'm a responsible father, so not a lot of good<end_line>
I'd be to my daughter, layin in the bottom of the mud<end_line>
Must be in my blood cause I don't know how I do it<end_line>
All I know is I don't want to follow in the footsteps<end_line>
of my dad, cause I hate him so bad<end_line>
The worst fear that I had was growin up to be like his fuckin ass<end_line>
Man if you could understand why I am the way that I am<end_line>
What do I say to my fans when I tell 'em I'm..<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I don't wanna quit, but shit, I feel like this is it<end_line>
for me to have this much appeal like this is sick<end_line>
This is not a game, this fame, in real life this is sick<end_line>
Publicity stunt my ass, consume my fuckin dick<end_line>
Fuck the guns, I'm done, I'll never look at gats<end_line>
If I scrap, I'll scrap like I ain't never whupped some ass<end_line>
I love my fans, but no one ever puts a grasp<end_line>
on the fact I've sacrificed everything I have<end_line>
I never dreamt I'd get to the level that I'm at<end_line>
This is wack, this is more than I ever coulda asked<end_line>
Everywhere I go, a hat, a sweater hood or mask<end_line>
What about math, how come I wasn't ever good at that?<end_line>
It's like the boy in the bubble, who never could adapt<end_line>
I'm trapped, if I could go back, I never woulda rapped<end_line>
I sold my soul to the devil I'll never get it back<end_line>
I just wanna leave this game with level head intact<end_line>
Imagine goin from bein a no one to seein<end_line>
everything blow up and all you did was just grow up emceein<end_line>
It's fuckin crazy, cause all I wanted was to give Hailie<end_line>
the life I never had, instead I forced us to live alienated<end_line>
So I'm sayin..<end_line>
<verse_end>
