This ain't beef man<end_line>

But no beef<end_line>

I float like B.I.G.'s spirit in this bitch I'm ghostly<end_line>
Rush me, cause you ain't gonna live to roast me<end_line>
I'd have my motherfuckin ass kicked by Moby<end_line>
if I let some bitch in the Can like 'Bis cop over me<end_line>
to do war, and try to bring my crew back down<end_line>
I'll never stoop, to that level, to do that now<end_line>
I got a new cat, this time I'm pullin two gats out<end_line>
With bullets, I finally got somethin to shoot at now<end_line>

I never really smashed on Jermaine's ass, Dre smashed him<end_line>
Nobody ganged up 'til he came back and jacked him<end_line>
I never really brought it to his ass, I tapped him<end_line>
I coulda been like Treach, boom-bapped and slapped him<end_line>
purple, for mimickin him with two rappin Urkels<end_line>
I coulda snapped, took it past rap and hurt you<end_line>
But I didn't, I kept it on wax and served you<end_line>
I "Square Dance" cause I'm sick of rappin circles<end_line>
around these clowns, stready tryin to call me out<end_line>
It's like I'm listenin to motherfuckin dogs meow<end_line>
You'd probably do better tryin to come and stomp me out<end_line>
You don't want it with rap, this is what I'm all about - c'mon<end_line>
No gangsta you ain't either<end_line>
But I know that I spit "Ether"<end_line>
I shit across your belly<end_line>
Show you I'm not R. Kelly<end_line>
X, pass me the weed, I'ma put my ashes out on his ass<end_line>
For the last time man..<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
For the last time man, I'm through<end_line>
