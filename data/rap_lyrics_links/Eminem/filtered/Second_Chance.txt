Disappear in thin air, there go Game, nigga where<end_line>
Posted on the block in them black Airs<end_line>
In that all black Phantom, hug the block like a bear<end_line>
Yeah, that V12 is roarin'<end_line>
Flyin' through the city with the pedal to the floor then<end_line>
I put them 26 inches on the curb, tell the hood I'm back<end_line>
Give me a corner let me serve<end_line>
Swerve, I'm still dope that's my world<end_line>
All I did was switch the kitchens<end_line>
Did some tracks on the birds...<end_line>

I never would've dreamed in an a million years I'd see<end_line>
So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me, who share the same views<end_line>
And the same exact beliefs, it's like a fuckin' army, who marchin' in back of me<end_line>
So many lives touch<end_line>
So much anger aimed, in no particular direction, just sprays and sprays, and straight<end_line>
Through your radio waves it plays and plays<end_line>
Till it stays stuch in your head for days and days<end_line>
Who would of thought, standing in this mirror bleachin' my hair with some peroxide<end_line>
Reaching for a t-shirt to wear, that I would carapult to the forefront of rap like this<end_line>
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this<end_line>
I must've struck a chord, with somebody up in the office<end_line>
Cause congress keeps telling me I ain't causin' nothin' but problems<end_line>
And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government<end_line>
I'm lovin' it, I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumping it on...<end_line>

Look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself<end_line>
If they were brown, Shady loose<end_line>
Shady sits on the shelf, but Shady's cute, Shady knew, Shady's dimple's would help<end_line>
Make ladies swoon baby, ohh baby, look at my sales, let's do the math<end_line>
If I were black, I wouldn't of sold half<end_line>
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln high school to know that<end_line>
