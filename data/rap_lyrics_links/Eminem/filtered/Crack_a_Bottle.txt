<verse_start>
They see that low rider go by there, like "Oh my!"<end_line>
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick cuz I know why<end_line>
I dip through in that six trey like sick 'em Dre<end_line>
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me<end_line>
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA<end_line>
Cuz over and above all, it's just another day<end_line>
And this one begins where the last one ends<end_line>
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again<end_line>
I'll be damned, just fucked around and crashed my Benz<end_line>
Driving around with a smashed front end<end_line>
Let's cash that one in<end_line>
Grab another one from out the stable<end_line>
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Derado<end_line>
The hell if I know<end_line>
Do I want leather seats or vinyl<end_line>
Decisions, decisions garage looks like precision collision<end_line>
Or maico beats quake like Waco<end_line>
Just keep the bass low speakers away from your face though<end_line>

<verse_start>
Back when Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk<end_line>
Picture us, you'll just be another one bit the dust<end_line>
Just one of my mother's son who got thrown under the bus<end_line>
Kiss my butt lick my wonder cheese from under my nuts<end_line>
They disgust, me to see the game the way that it looks<end_line>
It's a must, I redeem my name n haters get murked<end_line>
Bitches lust man they love me when I lay in the cut<end_line>
Missed the cut the lady give a raidy some paper cut<end_line>
Now picture us It's ridiculous you curse at the thought<end_line>
Cuz when I spit the verse the shit gets worse and worse cause your soft<end_line>
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time<end_line>
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes<end_line>
It's elementary the elephants have entered the room<end_line>
I venture to say with the same repetition is true<end_line>
Not to mention back with a vengeance, so here's the signal<end_line>
Of the bat symbol The platinum dude is back on you hoes<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
It's sorta like pourin' Draino down a live volcano<end_line>
You never know what'll happen next, it may blow<end_line>
Same thing happens to the beats when Dre blows<end_line>
I talk shit, but my dick's long as my payroll<end_line>
I get ass like a ball player, but I'm a boss player<end_line>
Pimpin' hoes from here to Australia<end_line>
Till I get heart failure<end_line>
Look at ya half of ya'll, all scared<end_line>
Other half, hands up in the air, like "Awww yeah"<end_line>
This is our year, this is what you call sheer talent,<end_line>
But I think at this point it's just obvious<end_line>
Fierce, they say my music's good for all queers<end_line>
Cuz I make your ear ring, get it?, piercin' all ears<end_line>
Call us the mafia We got the fucking mob here<end_line>
Gimme the hate and I'll feed off of ya's all year<end_line>
Shit, I'm just doing my job here<end_line>
You don't want no problem, do ya?<end_line>
Fuck it, I'll even crack a bottle for ya<end_line>
<verse_end>
