<verse_start>
Met a retarted kid named Greg, with a wooden leg<end_line>
Snatched it off and beat him over the head with a peg<end_line>
Go to bed with a keg, wake up with a forty<end_line>
Mix it with Alka Seltzer and Formula 44-D<end_line>
Forget an acid tab I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead<end_line>
Wait until it absorbed and fell to the floor dead<end_line>
No more said case closed end of discussion<end_line>
We blowing up like spontaneous human combustion<end_line>
Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and dramas<end_line>
Cross the bombest<end_line>
We blowing up your house<end_line>
Killing your parents and coming back to get your foster mommas<end_line>
I'm as good at keeping a promise as Nastradamus<end_line>
Cause I ain't making no more threats<end_line>
I'm doing drive-bys in tinted Corvettes<end_line>
On Vietnam war vets<end_line>
I am more or less sick in the head<end_line>
Maybe more <end_line>
Because I smoked crack  today, yesterday,<end_line>
and the day before Sabateur<end_line>
Walk the block with a labrador<end_line>
Strapped with more straps than El Salvador<end_line>
Foul style galore<end_line>
Verbal cow manure<end_line>
Coming together like an eyebrow on Al B. Sure<end_line>
