In my mind I'm a fighter, my hearts a lighter<end_line>
My soul is the fluid, my flow sparks it right up<end_line>
But arsenic writer, often with arth-er-itis<end_line>
Carpel-tunnel, Marshal with start shit-itis<end_line>
Hard-headed and hot-headed<end_line>
Bull-headed and pig-headed<end_line>
Dick-headed a prick, a big headache I'm sick<end_line>
Quick with it for every lyric spit it<end_line>
There are 6 critics who wait, for me to slip with it<end_line>
So quick this dynamite stick, bury the wick<end_line>
It's gonna ex-plode any minute, some lunatic<end_line>
Lit it and its not Nelly, do not tell me to stop yelling<end_line>
When I stop selling I'll quit so, stop dwelling<end_line>
I am not failing, you fuckers are not ready<end_line>
Cause I got jelly, like Beyonce's pot belly<end_line>
This is destiny, yes money<end_line>
I'm off running, so get off of me<end_line>
I'm not slowing the softening<end_line>

No apologies, nah suckers I'm not sorry<end_line>
You can all sue me; y'all could be the cause of me<end_line>
No apologies, y'all feeling the force of me<end_line>
No remorse for me, like there was no recoursefor me<end_line>
No apologies, not even acknowledging you at all<end_line>
Till I get a call that God's coming<end_line>
No apologies, laugh fuckers, its all funny<end_line>
I can spit in your face while you're standing across from me<end_line>
No apologies<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
My head hits the pillow, a weeping willow<end_line>
I can't sleep, a pain so deep it bellows<end_line>
But these cellos, help just to keep me mellow<end_line>
Hands on my head, touch knees to elbows<end_line>
I'm hunched over emotion just flows over<end_line>
These cold shoulders are both frozen<end_line>
You don't know me<end_line>
I keep saying it, I can't stress it enough<end_line>
So keep playing it, and stand next to the subs<end_line>
I choke mics like affixation<end_line>
When I'm strangling my own throat masturbating<end_line>
Fuck yeah I'm a basket case<end_line>
And I mastered this rap shit till my ass gets wasted<end_line>
Till my assassination, till I'm slain cuz of some fags infatuation<end_line>
.44 Mag's fascination a taste for disaster and if that's the case then<end_line>

This song isn't for you it's for me<end_line>
A true MC, it's what he'll do<end_line>
Just to see if he still has it<end_line>
And if his skills mastered<end_line>
He's able to spill raps long after he's killed that's a<end_line>
Real MC got you feeling me<end_line>
Whether willing or unwillingly, you still agree<end_line>
As long as there's still this hunger, and will in me<end_line>
Then expect a longer life expectancy<end_line>
I'd be a savage beast if I ain't had this outlet to salvage me<end_line>
Inside, I'd be exploding soaked in self loathing<end_line>
And mourning so I'm warning you don't coax me<end_line>
It's silly, but really its sheep in wolves clothing<end_line>
Who only reacts when he gets pushed don't be<end_line>
fooled, the press blows up this whole thing<end_line>
It's stupid, they don't know cuz they don't see<end_line>
That I'm wounded, all they did was ballooned it<end_line>
I'm sick of talking bout these tattoos Cartoon did<end_line>
That's why I tuned it OUT I'm sick of duking<end_line>
They can suck my dick while I'm puking, and you too you can<end_line>

Expect no sympathy from me<end_line>
I'm an MC, this is how I'm supposed to be<end_line>
Cold as a G, my hearts frozen it don't even beat<end_line>
So expect no apologies<end_line>
Expect no sympathy from me<end_line>
I'm an MC, this is how I'm supposed to be<end_line>
Cold as a G, my hearts frozen it don't even beat<end_line>
So expect no apologies<end_line>
