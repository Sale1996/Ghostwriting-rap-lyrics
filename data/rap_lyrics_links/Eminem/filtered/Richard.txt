It's +Notorious+ the way I got +Big+ spittin stories<end_line>
BME's X-Clan, +Vanglorious+<end_line>
We not your favorite fuck it, you know the system and you buck it<end_line>
Have you revisitin, how you used to love it<end_line>
A nigga spew through the music acoustics<end_line>
Cool kid, used to pursue excuses<end_line>
Truth is I was truant in school<end_line>
So his influence is foolish, that was my views<end_line>
I'm back at it, the rap addict by any means<end_line>
We gon' get these stacks accurate, no skinny jeans<end_line>
Say he ain't a star, niggaz might be right<end_line>

Chka-chk-chka-chk, and I would like<end_line>
to introduce my-s-self, surprise! HI, it's Ike~!<end_line>
'Bout get my Ike on, I come with a life supply of wife<end_line>
beaters and my Nikes on, and a white tee over that Iron Mike<end_line>
Lookin fly tonight, feelin like I might die from a spider bite<end_line>
Come back as Spider-Man, +Park+ my +Peter+ inside a dyke<end_line>
Bitch actin like she got fuckin higher standards than Meijer's, right<end_line>
Had to pry her fingers off of the motherfuckin Breyers ice <end_line>
cream with the pliers likeonly a ruthless bastard would do this<end_line>
Take a toothless bitch with no taste buds to Ruth's Chris<end_line>
Give her toothpicks, and stop on the way home pick up two big Bufords<end_line>
Scrupulous girl you got a nice pair, but you're plum stupid<end_line>
So when I pull up in that Benz don't try to pretend you ain't interested<end_line>
to impress your stupid ass friends and refuse to get in, woman<end_line>
and get slammed on the ground and SNAP like a pool stick against, cement<end_line>
If you should get dick, pretend like it's a musical instrument<end_line>
You get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<end_line>
I can tell at first glance you're a hoe, cause your pants are so<end_line>
tight when you dance with O. Trice your implants explode<end_line>
So cold to dykes the chance of snow, in San Francisco<end_line>
Well I'm from Detroit City, you live in animosity<end_line>
That's a fucked up state to be in, such an atrocity<end_line>
Look where these random thoughts get me, it's senseless mind babble<end_line>
What, me apologize?It's just the way the rhyme unravels<end_line>
And I wouldn't fuckin take it back if I TIME TRAVELLED!<end_line>
