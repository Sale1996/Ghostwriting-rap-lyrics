Life.. by Marshall Mathers<end_line>
What is life?<end_line>
Life is like a big obstacle<end_line>
put in front of your optical to slow you down<end_line>
And everytime you think you gotten past it<end_line>
it's gonna come back around and tackle you to the damn ground<end_line>
What are friends?<end_line>
Friends are people that you think are your friends<end_line>
But they really your enemies, with secret indentities<end_line>
and disguises, to hide they true colors<end_line>
So just when you think you close enough to be brothers<end_line>
they wanna come back and cut your throat when you ain't lookin<end_line>
What is money?<end_line>
Money is what makes a man act funny<end_line>
Money is the root of all evil<end_line>

But if I had a million dollars<end_line>
I'd buy a damn brewery, and turn the planet into alcoholics<end_line>
If I had a magic wand, I'd make the world suck my dick<end_line>
without a condom on, while I'm on the john<end_line>
If I had a million bucks<end_line>
it wouldn't be enough, because I'd still be out<end_line>
robbing armored trucks<end_line>
If I had one wish<end_line>
I would ask for a big enough ass for the whole world to kiss<end_line>
