Welcome to the Slim Shady Mecca, Rebecca<end_line>
It's the village in New York right next to the Tribeca<end_line>
That's my sector, homosexual dissector<end_line>
Come again, rewind selector!<end_line>
I said nice rectum, I had a vasectomy Hector<end_line>
So you can't get pregnant if I bi-sexually wreck ya<end_line>
Hannibal Lecter in the guy section I bet ya<end_line>
I tantalize ya and in less than five seconds I get ya<end_line>
They say once bitten and twice shy, well lie next to<end_line>
the guy with nine extasy pills and five extra<end_line>
Boxes of ripped condoms in quantities, why yes sir<end_line>
I took the rest of the Lunesta pills from my dresser<end_line>
That's my kind of vibe, what else should I try Lester?<end_line>
Dropkick the bitch before her second trimester<end_line>
Perform the home abortion with Dexter then I guess I'll<end_line>
dig her fetus out with a wire hanger then digest her<end_line>

All my Westside bitches throw it up<end_line>
Put a balloon inside your pussy, queef and blow it up<end_line>
Man I think that he just fell off the deep end, sho' enough<end_line>
So you better change the station to keep from throwin up<end_line>
Man you seen it all before, you're all too familiar with it<end_line>
There's a penis on the floor and two balls so you know who did it<end_line>
You know you with it girl, don't front, oh no you didn't<end_line>
I won't rape all the Pussycat Dolls? Nicole you kiddin?<end_line>
I'll pee on Rihanna, see man I do what I wanna<end_line>
Spray perfume in the sauna room, crazy gluing Madonna<end_line>
to the La-Z-Boy sofa, fold her in two then sit on her<end_line>
Imagine a visual for that man, who woulda thought I<end_line>
could ever be such a relentless prick unleashing his vengeace<end_line>
But the chick's so old she looks like she out-lived a life sentence<end_line>
I never meant this, rhyme to be so offensive<end_line>
If you weren't so defensive it wouldn't be, you're so sensitive!<end_line>

Put Christopher Reeves on a unicycle with a kickstand<end_line>
Kick it up and push him and lead him right into quicksand<end_line>
Here, you need a hand, big man? Grab hold of this branch<end_line>
with both hands, man they don't understand I'm just a sick man<end_line>
Now everybody's pissed at me - like it's my fault<end_line>
his name rhymes with so many different words, jeez!<end_line>
So one last time, Mr. Christopher Reeves<end_line>
Won't you break it down for me and just spit the verse, please<end_line>
"Eminem, I'm coming to kill you<end_line>
 Always hated you and I still do<end_line>
 You'll never fill my shoes, my Superman costume<end_line>
 doesn't even fit you, they don't feel you<end_line>
 You're taking this shit too far<end_line>
 Who do you think you are? Hang my suit up in the armoire<end_line>
 Every day I hate you more and more, throw down the cardboard<end_line>
 Let's breakdance if you think you're hardcore"<end_line>

The world is mine!<end_line>
