<verse_start>
Feelin kinky, lip syncing to Too $hort's "Freaky Tales"<end_line>
Havin creepy visions of whiskey drinking<end_line>
Envisioning sneaking into where Christie Brinkley dwells<end_line>
I know this is risky thinking but I wanna +stick+ her like she decals<end_line>
But when murdering females, better pay attention to these details<end_line>
or you could be derailed, better wear at least three layers<end_line>
of clothing or be in jail<end_line>
If you get scratched because your DNA'll, be all up under her fingernails<end_line>
Man, he hears you, I don't think he cares<end_line>
He gives a fuck, even his pinky swears<end_line>
Three personalities burstin out of me, please beware<end_line>
Her TV blares, can't hear the creaking stairs<end_line>
She's unaware in no underwear, she's completely bare<end_line>
Turns around and screams I remember distinctly, I said "I'm here to do sink repairs"<end_line>
Chop her up, put her body parts in front of Steven Avery's<end_line>
trailer and leave 'em there<end_line>
But hey man<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Woke up it was dawn, musta knew somethin was wrong<end_line>
Think I'm becomin a monster cause of the drugs that I'm on<end_line>
Donald Duck's on as the Tonka Truck in the yard<end_line>
But dawg, how the fuck is Ivanka Trump in the trunk of my car?<end_line>
Gotta get to the bottom of it to try to solve it<end_line>
Must go above and beyond, cause it's incumbent upon<end_line>
me, plus I feel somewhat responsible for the dumb little blonde<end_line>
girl, that motherfuckin baton twirler that got dumped in the pond<end_line>
Second murder with no recollection of it<end_line>
Collectin newspaper articles, cuttin up sections from it<end_line>
Memory's too fucked to remember, destructive temper<end_line>
Cut my public defender's jugular then stuck him up in a blender<end_line>
'Nother dismembered toddler discovered this winter probably<end_line>
Cause the disassembled body was covered up in the snow since the month of November oddly<end_line>
I'm wanted for questioning<end_line>
Them son of a bitches probably just wanna pin this on me<end_line>
But hey man<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Still on the loose they, spotted me inside McDonald's Tuesday<end_line>
In a Toronto Blue Jays cap lookin like your college roommate<end_line>
With Rihanna, Lupe, Saddam Hussein, Bobby Boucher<end_line>
Or was it Cool J? The cops is on a goose chase<end_line>
Just escaped from the state pen foreight women who hate men<end_line>
Don't make it no weirder, I'm naked when I break in your basement<end_line>
Under your baby's playpen, I lay and wait adjacent<end_line>
Facin the door, remaining patient while staying complacent, blatant<end_line>
Sexual implications are continuing to get thrown<end_line>
Insinuations are placed in, little riddles and poems<end_line>
Left on your pillow in hopes, that when you get home<end_line>
You'll get the hint hoe, I'm in your window<end_line>
But it never occurred to me I could describe a murder scene<end_line>
in a verse and be charged with first degree<end_line>
Cause it just happened to match up perfectly<end_line>
with the massacre or the Burger King burglary<end_line>
No officer, you see<end_line>
<verse_end>
