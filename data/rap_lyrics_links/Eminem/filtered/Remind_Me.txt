<verse_start>
I bust in, devilish grin, disgusting<end_line>
Asshole, freckled cheeks and a butt chin<end_line>
Callin all party animals<end_line>
Get on the floor when I pop up on some Whac-A-Mole shit<end_line>
In search of a chick who's stacked and so thick<end_line>
And implants are so big<end_line>
She can hang me up on that rack, big ol' tits like Anna Nicole Smith<end_line>
Body's bananas and sass to go with<end_line>
I spot you at first glance and go "Shit!"<end_line>
You're wearin those pants that don't fit<end_line>
That butt won't ever give up, that's why you stick it out no matter what<end_line>
Cause you got an ass that won't quit<end_line>
So, get on the horn, my saxophone<end_line>
Grab hold of my instrument, get a grasp and blow<end_line>
You just laugh and go - "Heehee"<end_line>
Cause you're just as nasty so, that's appropriate<end_line>
That's why<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I'm lookin at your tight rear like a sightseer<end_line>
Your booty is heavy duty, like diarrhea<end_line>
The plan's to bring you to my house<end_line>
You're drinkin Jack and Beam, I'm thinkin soon as trampoline so we should bounce<end_line>
But you're out of your tube-top<end_line>
If you're thinkin that mi casa es su casa<end_line>
Yeah you're a cute fox, perfect ten so, back that up like a moonwalk<end_line>
Girl you're smokin, like Snoop Dogg<end_line>
But you must be tokin/token, if you think you're takin over my quarters<end_line>
There goes a dime into the jukebox<end_line>
Two shots of blue Hpnotiq and soon I'll<end_line>
turn this pool hall to a barroom brawl<end_line>
So Rick, scratch on the break, like the cue ball<end_line>
Turn the volume all the way up on your boombox<end_line>
And excuse the locker room talk, I'm just too raw<end_line>
But apparently, so are you, ma<end_line>
Cause you just kicked me in the balls and told me to screw off<end_line>
And that's why<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Shorty you the shit, girl I order you to sit<end_line>
I know you're probably feelin me, more than you admit<end_line>
Pull up a chair sweetie, let me order you a drink<end_line>
I only go to meetings court-ordered from a shrink<end_line>
So from the bottom to the top, floor to ceiling<end_line>
You ain't run-of-the-mill, you're one in a million<end_line>
Cause real tits are still fun<end_line>
But everybody knows fake tits are still better than real ones...<end_line>
So come and spend the night with the guy most are terrified of<end_line>
But tonight, curiosity overrides ya<end_line>
Besides, you're fired up<end_line>
like a starter pistol, crystal and slide hun, tonight I'm your pilot<end_line>
Cause you should be up in the sky, girl<end_line>
You're so fuckin fly, you belong in the mile high club<end_line>
So c'mon baby, the night's young<end_line>
Don't string me along, I'm high-strung<end_line>
We might wind up, unbound like we're tryin for the Cy Young<end_line>
Fuckin 'fore we get to the house, screwin our brains out<end_line>
Like changin a lightbulb, that's why I like ya<end_line>
Cause I'm crazy just like ya<end_line>
Now every time I get brain you screw mine up<end_line>
I barely can think straight, your head game is a mindfuck<end_line>
So ready, set, aim and fire<end_line>
Yes babe, I'm fallin in likeness kinda, why I love<end_line>
<verse_end>
