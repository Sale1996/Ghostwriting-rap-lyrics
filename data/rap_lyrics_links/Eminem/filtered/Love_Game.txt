<verse_start>
Somethin's burnin, I can't figure out what<end_line>
It's either lust or a cloud of dust, judgment is clouded, must<end_line>
just be the powder from the power of<end_line>
but I'm in somethin I don't know how to get outta<end_line>
Left my girl in the house alone, IS THAT MY soon-to-be spouse's moan?<end_line>
And the further I walk, the louder<end_line>
Pause for a minute to make certain that's what I heard, cause after all this is her place<end_line>
so I give her the benefit of the doubt I<end_line>
think I might be about to - Busta-Bust her<end_line>
The thought's scary yo though and it hurts, BRACE<end_line>
Hope it ain't, "Here we go yo" cause my head already goes to worst CASE<end_line>
+Scenario+ though in the first PLACE<end_line>
But you confirmed my +Low End Theory+ though<end_line>
Should've known when I made it all the way to +3rd Bass+<end_line>
And that was only the first DATE, could've made it to home PLATE<end_line>
But you slid straight for the dome and dove face - first<end_line>
"Noyou don'tunderstand<end_line>
Idon'tdo this foranyoneever"<end_line>
Yeah that ain't what they all say, I'll say<end_line>
You can suck a softball through a straw, used to be my fiancée<end_line>
'til you sucked on Wayne, André and Kanye<end_line>
LeBron, Akon, Jay, Lil Jon, Raekwon, Ma$e<end_line>
Polow da Don, Dre, Dante Ross, James Conway, Kwame!<end_line>
Guess I'm gettin my g-goddang Jigga on, eh?<end_line>
Cause your name I'm +Beyon'+ sayin<end_line>
But fuck it I'm movin on, you women are all cra'y<end_line>
But I'll probably always keep on playin the<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
So needless to say I'm feelin betrayed, snatch my house key off her keychain<end_line>
She jumps off Wee-Bey from "The Wire"'s dick now she's chasin me with a cheese grater<end_line>
Here goes that broken record cliché, it's all my fault anyway<end_line>
She's turnin the tables, I'm a beat-break<end_line>
She treats my face like Serato, she cuts and scratches like a DJ, each day is an instant replay<end_line>
They say what we display is symptomatic of attack beha-<end_line>
-vior, back together, but forgot today was her b-day<end_line>
She cut me off on the freeway<end_line>
Simple misunderstandin, but just as I went to slam on the brakes<end_line>
that's when I realized that she may be crazy as me, wait<end_line>
Bitch cut my fuckin brake line, stepped on them fuckers eight times, still goin 73 thank<end_line>
God there's an exit comin up, what the mother-F-U-C-K's<end_line>
wrong with her? Hit the off-ramp 'til I coasted<end_line>
to a gosh damn halt, hit a fuckin tree, now<end_line>
here she comes at full speed, she's racin at me, okay you wanna fuck with me, eh?<end_line>
Snatch the bitch out her car through the window, she's screamin<end_line>
I body slam her on the cement until the concrete gave<end_line>
And created a sinkhole, buried the stink hoe in it then paid to have the street re-paved!<end_line>
Woke up in a dream state<end_line>
in a cold sweat like I got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave<end_line>
Guess I eventually caved though, cause she's layin next to me in bed<end_line>
DIRECTLY AIMIN A GAT AT MY HEAD!<end_line>
Woke up again and jumped up like "Fuck it, I've had it!"<end_line>
I'm checkin into rehab, I confess I'm a static addict<end_line>
I guess that's why I'm so clingy, every girl I've ever had <end_line>
either says I got too much baggage or I'm too fuckin dramatic<end_line>
Man what the fuck is the matter? I'm just a fuckin romantic<end_line>
I fuckin love you, you fuckin bitch! Combative, possessive<end_line>
In fact last time I was mad at an ex<end_line>
I actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events<end_line>
I said "Hit the road" then after she left I sent that bitch a text<end_line>
that said "Be careful drivin, don't read this and have a accident," she glanced to look at it and wrecked!<end_line>
Too bad, thought we had a connect, no sense dwelling makes<end_line>
Never been a more compelling case than the model covered in L'Oréal and mace<end_line>
who fell from grace eleven stories for story telling while the whore was yelling rape<end_line>
'til her vocal chords were swelling and her voice was more hoarser/horser than Tori Spelling's FACE!<end_line>
Still they swarm the gates<end_line>
of my fancy estates to greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace<end_line>
'Less you're Andrea Yates don't ask me for a date, though you're late<end_line>
Well the sentiment's great - but wait, think there's been a mistake<end_line>
You wanted an intimate date, I wanna intimidate<end_line>
I have infinite hate in my blood, it's mainly cause of the game of<end_line>
Wait, "Dinner at 8?"<end_line>
I have infinite hate in my blood, it's mainly cause of the<end_line>
