My squabbles, I'm grappling with, your time travelling with me<end_line>
Try and follow, as I wobble - relapse into history<end_line>
with a flask of the whiskey, tip it back then I'm twisting wine bottles<end_line>
Like what happened to Chris Reeve's spine column<end_line>
That's the plan of attack when I'm fixing my problems<end_line>
Wish my chest wasn't havin to get these rhymes off 'em<end_line>
But the fact that I have so many rappers against me mind boggles<end_line>
And why I haven't come back on these faggots who diss me<end_line>
is more of a spectacular mystery than a fuckin Agatha Christie CRIME novel!<end_line>

Light the match to ignite the wrath<end_line>
Got knives to slash and slice hermaphrodites in half<end_line>
Piper Chapmans might just have to pick-et me, like a scab<end_line>
Hard to describe in fact, startling violent perhaps<end_line>
are things that come to mind as soon as I start spitting rhymes like that<end_line>
And you aren't really surprised at that, but as far as these lines I rap<end_line>
and these bars wouldn't dial it back if I star 69'ed the TRACK!<end_line>
