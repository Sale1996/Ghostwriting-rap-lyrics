<verse_start>
I got fat while I was gone, but now I'm here<end_line>
And yall rappers only bust shots only in fear<end_line>
Chinchillas on my back, itchy fingers on the Mac<end_line>
Get scrilla off of crack, get 50's shooter back<end_line>
Listen homie, don't let them niggaz amp you money<end_line>
Cause I got niggaz in Queens that kill for Pamper money<end_line>
Move like kaiser, Jayson Williams slaughter the driver<end_line>
My daughter Maniyah, know that the kid spit fire<end_line>
Reality rap, nigga check my salary cap<end_line>
I give guns to my soldiers with a battery pack<end_line>
What you know about light planes and heavy coke<end_line>
And them drugs being smuggled on them fast speed boats<end_line>
It's the rap tycoon, Tony yall all know me<end_line>
See me on MTV, I'm a parolee<end_line>
I was out for twelve hours and went right back in<end_line>
For three hots and one cot doing time in the pen<end_line>
