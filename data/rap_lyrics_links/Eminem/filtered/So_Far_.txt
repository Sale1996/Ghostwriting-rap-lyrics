This always happens, thirty minutes from home gotta lay a log cabin<end_line>
Only option I have's McDonalds' bathroom<end_line>
In a public stall droppin a football<end_line>
so every time someone walks, in the +John+ I get +Maddened+<end_line>
"Shady, what up?" What? C'mon man, I'm crappin<end_line>
and you're askin for my goddamn autograph on a napkin?<end_line>
Oh that's odd, I just happened<end_line>
to run out of tissue, yeah hand me that, on second thought I'd be glad then<end_line>
"Thanks dawg, name's Todd, a big fan"<end_line>
I wiped my ass with it, crumbled it up in a wad, threw it back and<end_line>
Told him "Todd, you're the shit," when's all of this crap end?<end_line>
Can't pump my gas without causin an accident<end_line>
Pump my gas, cut my grass, I can't take out the fuckin trash<end_line>
without someone passin through my sub harassin<end_line>
I'd count my blessings but I suck at math<end_line>
I'd rather wallow than bask, sufferin succotash<end_line>
But the antacid, it gives my stomach gas<end_line>
when I mix my corn with my fuckin mashed<end_line>
potatoes, so what hoe, kiss my country bumpkin ass<end_line>
Missouri Southern roots, what the fuck is upper class?<end_line>
Call lunch dinner, call dinner supper<end_line>
Tupperware in the cupboard, plasticware up the ass<end_line>
Stuck in the past, iPod, what the fuck is that?<end_line>
B-boy to the core, mule I'm as stubborn as<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
They call me classless, I heard that, I second and third that<end_line>
Don't know what the fuck I'd doin if it weren't rap, probably be a giant turd-sack<end_line>
But I blew, never turned back<end_line>
Turned 40 and still sag, teenagers act more fuckin mature jack<end_line>
Fuck you gonna say to me? I'll leave on my own terms ass-<end_line>
-hole, I'm goin +Berzerk+, my nerves are bad<end_line>
but I love the perks my work has<end_line>
I get to meet famous people, look at her, dag<end_line>
Her nylons are ran, her skirt's snagged<end_line>
And I heard she drag-races,- tuck in my Hanes shirt tag<end_line>
You're Danica Patrickword skag<end_line>
We'd be the perfect match, cause you're a vacuum, I'm a dirtbag<end_line>
My apologies, no disrespect to technology<end_line>
But what the heck's all of these buttons? <end_line>
You expect me to sit here and learn that?<end_line>
Fuck I gotta do to hear this new song from Luda? Be an expert at<end_line>
computers? I'd rather be an Encyclopedia Britannica, hell with<end_line>
Playstation, I'm still on my first man on some Zelda<end_line>
Nintendo bitch, run, jump, punch, stab and I melt the<end_line>
mozzarella on my spaghetti, put in on bread, make a sandwich with Welch's<end_line>
and belch, they say this spray butter's bad for my health but<end_line>
I think this poor white trash from the trailer<end_line>
Jed Clampett, Fred Sanford and welfare, mentality helps to<end_line>
keep me grounded, that's why I never take full advantage of wealth, I<end_line>
managed to dwell, within these parameters<end_line>
Still crammin the shelves full of Hamburger Helper<end_line>
I can't even help it, this is the hand I was dealt, a<end_line>
creature of habit, feel like I'm trapped in an animal shelter<end_line>
with all these pet peeves, goddamn it to hell I<end_line>
can't stand all these kids, with their camera cellphones<end_line>
I can't go anywhere, I get so mad I could yell, the<end_line>
other day, someone got all elaborate<end_line>
and stuck a head from a fuckin dead cat in my mailbox<end_line>
Went to Burger King, they spit on my onion rings<end_line>
I think my karma's catchin up with me<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Got friends on Facebook, all over the world<end_line>
Not sure what that means, they tell me it's good<end_line>
So I'm Artist of the Decade, I even got a plaque<end_line>
I'd hang it up but, the frame is all cracked<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I'm tryin to be low-key, hopefully nobody notices me<end_line>
in produce, hunched over, giant nose bleed<end_line>
Ogre, style as I, mosey<end_line>
over to the frozen aisle, by the frozen, yogurt, this guy approached me<end_line>
Embarrassed, I just did Comerica, with Hova<end_line>
The show's over, I'm hidin in Kroger, buyin groceries<end_line>
He just had front row seats, told me, sign this poster then insults me<end_line>
"WOW, up close didn't know you had crow's feet!"<end_line>
I'm at a crossroads, lost, still shoppin at Costco<end_line>
Sloppy joes, bulk waffles<end_line>
Got caught pickin my nose, ahh~! Look over see these two hot hoes<end_line>
Finger still up one of my nostrils<end_line>
Right next to 'em, stuck at the light, the fuckin shit's<end_line>
takin forever to change, it's stuck, these bitches are lovin it<end_line>
Rubbin it in, chucklin - couldn't do nothin<end_line>
Play it off, "What you bumpin?" "'Trunk Muzik', Yelawolf's better!" Fuckin bitch<end_line>
They want me to flip at the label but I won't succumb to it<end_line>
The pressure, they want me to follow up with a-<end_line>
-nother one after "Recovery" was so highly coveted<end_line>
But what good is a fuckin recovery, if I fumble it?<end_line>
Cause I'ma drop the ball if I don't get a grip<end_line>
Hoppin out shrubbery on you sons of bitches - wrong subdivison<end_line>
to fuck with bitch, quit snappin fuckin pictures of my kids, I love my<end_line>
but you pushed me to my limit, what a<end_line>
The shit I complain about<end_line>
It's like there ain't a cloud in the sky and it's rainin out<end_line>

But bitch I got an +Elevator+ in my house, ants and a mouse!<end_line>
I'm livin the DREAM!<end_line>
