<verse_start>
I've been praised and labelled as crazed<end_line>
My mother was unable to raise me, full of crazy rage<end_line>
An angry teenager, nothin can change me back<end_line>
Gangsta rap made me act like a maniac<end_line>
I was boostin, so influenced by music I used it<end_line>
as an excuse to do shit, ooh I was stupid<end_line>
No one can tell me nothin hip-hop overwhelmed me<end_line>
to the point where it had me in a whole 'nother realm<end_line>
It was like isolatin myself was healthy<end_line>
It felt like we was on welfare but wealthy<end_line>
Compelled me to excel when school it failed me<end_line>
Expelled me and when the principal would tell me<end_line>
I was nothin, and I wouldn't amount to shit<end_line>
I made my first million and counted it<end_line>
Now look at, a fuckin drop-out that quits<end_line>
Stupid as shit, rich as fuck, and proud of it<end_line>
That's why<end_line>
