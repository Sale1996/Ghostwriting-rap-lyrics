<verse_start>
You ain't no killa, you a pussy<end_line>
That ecstasy done got you all emotional and mushy<end_line>
Bitch is wearin' rags in photos, Ja's words bein' quoted<end_line>
In The Source stealin' Pac's shit like he just wrote it<end_line>
You loudmouths, pray to God hopin' no one's listenin'<end_line>
See 50 comin' for me I'ma guard my, my position<end_line>
No one'll pay attention to me, please Gotti<end_line>
Here I go, give me this pill<end_line>
Ecstasy done got me feelin' so... invincible<end_line>
Now all a sudden I'm a fuckin' mad man who screams like I'm Pac<end_line>
But I'm not, enemies, Hennessy<end_line>
Actin' like I'm great, but I'm fake, I'm crazy<end_line>
Sweat drip get me off this trip, someone stop this train<end_line>
Some say my brain is all corrupted, fucked from this shit<end_line>
I'm stuck, I'm addicted to these drugs, I'ma quit<end_line>
sayin' motherfuckas names before somebody fucks me up<end_line>
Ain't no pussies over here partner, see you in hell, fucka<end_line>
