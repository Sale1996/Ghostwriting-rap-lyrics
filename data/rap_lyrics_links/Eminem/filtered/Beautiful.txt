I'm just so fuckin depressed I just can't seem to get out this slump<end_line>
If I could just get over this hump but I need somethin to pull me out this dump<end_line>
I took my bruises, took my lumps, fell down and I got right back up<end_line>
But I need that spark to get psyched back up in order for me to pick the mic back up<end_line>
I don't know how or, why or when I ended up in this position I'm in<end_line>
I'm startin to feel distant again so I decided just to pick this pen<end_line>
up and try to make an attempt to vent but I just can't admit<end_line>
Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap, I need a new outlet<end_line>
And I know some shit's so hard to swallow, but I just can't sit back and wallow<end_line>
in my own sorrow, but I know one fact I'll be one tough act to follow<end_line>
One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow<end_line>
Here today, gone tomorrow, but you'd have to walk a thousand miles<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I think I'm startin to lose my sense of humor, everything's so tense and gloom I<end_line>
almost feel like I gotta check the temperature of the room just as soon as<end_line>
I walk in it's like all eyes on me, so I try to avoid any eye contact<end_line>
Cause if I do that then it opens a door for conversation, like I want that<end_line>
I'm not lookin for extra attention, I just wanna be just like you<end_line>
Blend in with the rest of the room, maybe just point me to the closest restroom<end_line>
I don't need no fuckin man-servant tryin to follow me around and wipe my ass<end_line>
Laugh at every single joke I crack and half of 'em ain't even funny like "HA!<end_line>
Marshall you're so funny man, you should be a comedian, goddamn!"<end_line>
Unfortunately I am, I just hide behind the tears of a clown<end_line>
So why don't you all sit down? Listen to the tale I'm about to tell<end_line>
Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes, and you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Nobody asked for life to deal us with these bullshit hands we're dealt<end_line>
We gotta take these cards ourselves and flip 'em, don't expect no help<end_line>
Now I could've either just sat on my ass and pissed and moaned<end_line>
Or take this situation in which I'm placed in and get up and get my own!<end_line>
I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags<end_line>
And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed for a dad to show up who never did<end_line>
I just wanted to fit in in every single place, every school I went<end_line>
I dreamed of bein that cool kid, even if it meant actin stupid<end_line>
Aunt Edna always told me, "Keep makin that face it'll get stuck like that"<end_line>
Meanwhile I'm just standin there holdin my tongue tryin to talk like this<end_line>
'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old<end_line>
I learned my lesson then cause I wasn't tryin to impress my friends no mo'<end_line>
But I already told you my whole life story, not just based on my description<end_line>
Cause where you see it from where you're sittin is probably 110% different<end_line>
I guess we would have to walk a mile in each other's shoes at least<end_line>
What size you wear? I wear 10's, let's see if you can fit your feet<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Lately I've been hard to reach, I've been too long on my own<end_line>
Everybody has a private world where they can be, alone<end_line>
Are you calling me? Are you trying to get through?<end_line>
Are you reaching out for me? I'm reaching out, for you<end_line>
