<verse_start>
God please would you arm me with the armor to calm me when there's drama<end_line>
like Gandhi, coulda gone the other way many times, coulda turned Dalai with the +Lama+<end_line>
But I squashed my, beefs and things seem to be lookin decent recently but don't jinx it<end_line>
It's like Clint Eastwood lookin for peace, though maybe not fin' to enter, the priesthood<end_line>
But at least should make an attempt to show some remorse and then be some sort of a repenter<end_line>
for the people I've been a menace to, not a preacher but a shit-starter and finisher<end_line>
Into the mind of a thick skin but a short temper, this patience of mine is, thinner<end_line>
than twine is when I, get attacked so I might say somethin back that might offend ya<end_line>
So if you don't like when I rap of what I have to say on the mic then ya<end_line>
might wanna act just like quarterbacks and take a fuckin hike when I snap cause, I'm a sinner<end_line>
And uhbust balls and intestines, and ain't never been yes-men<end_line>
They gon' tell me when I'm fuckin up the minute I'm ever givin it less than<end_line>
I'm about to vomit and I can feel it comin cause failure's somethin I can barely stomach<end_line>
And I only listen to my guts so unless you're my fuckin belly button, don't tell me nothin!<end_line>
You ain't mywho you think I'm talkin 'bout?<end_line>
Lifts me up when I'm down and out, still look to him without a doubt<end_line>
Still got ashout it out, like there's never been a louder mouth<end_line>
Shoulda never been allowed, I'm out, now that I got a higher power now<end_line>
With a blackout power outage, oww! Like powerless but they crowd around<end_line>
They tend to flock like shepherds, to black sheep but I'll be the worst thing<end_line>
that these motherfuckers ever heard, when I'm counted out, you be D.O.A. then announced<end_line>
They pronounce you dead when they sound it out, so prepare for arrival, your arch-enemy surrounds you now<end_line>
He's all around younot even a doctor's at the hospital, he coulda shiggy-shocked<end_line>
you back to life, just im-piggy-possible to revive you, that's word to the diggy-doc<end_line>
Stiggy-stoppin is not an option, somethin I'm not gonna do<end_line>
I'm the Iggy Pop of hip-hop when I walk in the booth, dawg I'm the truth<end_line>
like Biggie rockin with 2Pac in a suit, talkin to Proof droppin a deuce<end_line>
Fill up a syllable clip like a refillable strip, cock and I shoot!<end_line>
Who you think's my Glock that I use<end_line>
that I pull from to get my strength up against these haters?<end_line>
And they be waitin at the gate when you get sprayed up, sendin you hoes straight up<end_line>
to deal with my<end_line>
<verse_end>
