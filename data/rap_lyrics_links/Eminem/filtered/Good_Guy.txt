<verse_start>
Here we go, aga-in, from heroes<end_line>
to villains, used to be your, Romeo, but we both<end_line>
were jilted, a couple of times, so we had a slippery slope<end_line>
to deal with, but still it, gave me hope<end_line>
that we'll get, through it together, a severed earlobe<end_line>
Mailed to you in an E-N-V-E-lope<end_line>
Would be dope, but, what kind of lengths can you go?<end_line>
Pull a Vincent van Gogh, just to convince a damn hoe<end_line>
to be a housewife who outright lies<end_line>
She's blackout drunk, now she's backin out my drive<end_line>
I ran outside, why is she tryna act out? She's just about my size<end_line>
Hit me in the mouth twice, guys<end_line>
When someone you'd die for, sticks a steak knife in<end_line>
your heart, do you try more? Another late night in<end_line>
She stumbles through my door, lets the daylight in<end_line>
And all we do's fight more, and I ain't violent<end_line>
But she's goin through my drawers to plant the K-Y in<end_line>
I'm gettin accused by a whore, who smells like St. Ides and<end_line>
who's probably screwed five more guys, sucked eight-nine men<end_line>
I'm takin two-by-fours, to our eight-by-tens<end_line>
Bitch it's you I tore, out the frame, I win<end_line>
Put up a new high score, beat this game I'm in<end_line>
And here's some two-ply for, when you date my friends<end_line>
In order to wipe your ass when you moved your bowels<end_line>
When we renewed our vows, this the thanks I get?<end_line>
I'm waitin for the day I can<end_line>
hear you say, "Marshall, what a skank I've been<end_line>
And there's a new guy you're, bein replaced by him"<end_line>
Got your tubes tied for him, got that boob job for him<end_line>
Hurts me to my core, but the pain I'm in<end_line>
After you I swore, to make the gray skies end<end_line>
Here come the rays like wind, you get a pay hike and<end_line>
Am I the good guy or, do I just play like him?<end_line>
And hope that he dumps you<end_line>
It's like a dream come true, just to scream "Fuck you!"<end_line>
Guess you take life in the same way you play dice then<end_line>
Cause you just look at me and roll them little snake eyes in<end_line>
<verse_end>
