I never woulda dreamed in a million years I'd see<end_line>
so many motherfuckin people, who feel like me<end_line>
Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs<end_line>
It's like a fuckin ARMY marchin in back of me<end_line>
So many lives I touched, so much anger aimed<end_line>
in no particular direction, just sprays and sprays<end_line>
And straight through your radio waves, it plays and plays<end_line>
'til it stays stuck in your head, for days and days<end_line>
Who woulda thought; standin in this mirror bleachin my hair<end_line>
with some peroxide, reachin for a t-shirt to wear<end_line>
that I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?<end_line>
How could I predict my words would have an impact like this?<end_line>
I must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office<end_line>
Cause Congress keep tellin me, I ain't causin nuthin but problems<end_line>
And now they're sayin I'm in trouble with the government - I'm lovin it!<end_line>
I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumpin it on<end_line>

Look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself<end_line>
If they were brown Shady lose, Shady sits on the shelf<end_line>
But Shady's cute, Shady knew Shady's dimples would help<end_line>
Make ladies swoon babyLook at my sales<end_line>
Let's do the math - if I was black, I woulda sold half<end_line>
I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that<end_line>
But I could rap, so fuck school, I'm too cool to go back<end_line>
Gimme the mic, show me where the fuckin studio's at<end_line>
When I was underground, no one gave a fuck I was white<end_line>
No labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up I was like<end_line>
Fuck it - until I met Dre, the only one to look past<end_line>
Gave me a chance aand I lit a FIRE up under his ass<end_line>
Helped him get back to the top, every fan black that I got<end_line>
was probably his in exchange for every white fan that he's got<end_line>
Like damn; we just swapped - sittin back lookin at shit, wow<end_line>
I'm like my skin is it startin to work to my benefit now? It's..<end_line>

See the problem is, I speak to suburban kids<end_line>
who otherwise woulda never knew these words exist<end_line>
Whose moms probably woulda never gave two squirts of piss<end_line>
'til I created so much motherfuckin turbulence!<end_line>
Straight out the tube, right into your living rooms I came<end_line>
And kids flipped, when they knew I was produced by Dre<end_line>
That's all it took, and they were instantly hooked right in<end_line>
And they connected with me too because I looked like them<end_line>
That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope<end_line>
Searchin with a fine tooth comb, it's like this rope<end_line>
waitin to choke; tightenin around my throat<end_line>
Watchin me while I write this, like I don't like this<end_line>
All I hear is: lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy, sponsors working<end_line>
round the clock to try to stop my concerts early, surely<end_line>
Hip-Hop was never a problem in Harlem only in Boston<end_line>
After it bothered the fathers of daughters startin to blossom<end_line>
So now I'm catchin the flack from these activists when they raggin<end_line>
Actin like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch or say faggot, shit!<end_line>
Just look at me like I'm your closest pal<end_line>
The posterchild, the motherfuckin spokesman now for..<end_line>
<verse_end>

I'm just playin America, you know I love you<end_line>
