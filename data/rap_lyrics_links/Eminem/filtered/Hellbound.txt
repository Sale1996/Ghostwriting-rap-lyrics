Yo.. Slim Shady!<end_line>
Yo.. I'll fuckin.. I'll..<end_line>
I'll puke, eat it, and freak you<end_line>
Battle?  I'm too weeded to speak to<end_line>
The only key that I see to defeat you<end_line>
would be for me to remove these two Adidas and beat you<end_line>
and force feed you 'em both, and on each feet is a cleat shoe<end_line>
I'll lift you off your feet so fast with a roundhouse  <end_line>
you'll think I pulled the fuckin ground out from underneath you <end_line>
I ain't no fuckin G, I'm a cannibal <end_line>
I ain't tryin to shoot you, <end_line>
I'm tryin to chop you into pieces and eat you<end_line>
Wrap you in rope and plastic, stab you with broken glass <end_line>
and have you with open gashes strapped to a soakin mattress<end_line>
Coke and acid, black magic, cloaks and daggers<end_line>
Fuck the planet, until it spins on a broken axis<end_line>
I'm so bananas I'm showin up to your open casket<end_line>
to fill it full of explosive gasses<end_line>
and close it back with a lit match in it <end_line>
while I sit back and just hope it catches <end_line>
Blow you to fragments<end_line>
Laugh, roll you and smoke the ashes<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I see the light at the end<end_line>
But every time I take a step, it gets dim<end_line>
Tell me is this hell we're livin in?<end_line>
If so, heaven's got to be better<end_line>
But if we're hellbound, whatever, let's go down<end_line>
<verse_end>
