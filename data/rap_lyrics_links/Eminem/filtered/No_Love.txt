<verse_start>
I'm alive again, more alive than I have been in my whole entire life, I can<end_line>
see these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen<end_line>
I'm a little bit sicker than, most, shit's finna get thick again<end_line>
They say the, competition is stiff but I get a hard dick from this shit now stick it in<end_line>
I ain't never givin in again, caution to the wind, complete freedom<end_line>
Look at these rappers how I treat 'em, so why the fuck would I join 'em when I beat 'em?<end_line>
They call me a freak cause I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat 'em<end_line>
Man get these wack cocksuckers off stage, where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?<end_line>
Snatch the mic from him, bitch I'ma let you finish in a minute, yeah that rap was tight but I'm<end_line>
'bout to spit the greatest verse of all time so ya might wanna go back to the lab tonight and um<end_line>
scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit and start over from scratch and write new ones<end_line>
But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference <end_line>
when I rip the stage and tear it in half tonight, it's an<end_line>
adrenaline rush you feel the bass thump from the place all the way to the parking lot fellow<end_line>
Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd, you can see the sparks from hot metal<end_line>
Cold-hearted, from the day I Bogarted the game, my soul started to rot fellow<end_line>
When I'm not even at my harshest, you can still get roasted cause Marsh is not mellow<end_line>
'Til I'm topplin from the top I'm not gonna stop, I'm standin on my Monopoly board<end_line>
That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop 'til my hip don't hop anymore<end_line>
When you're so good that you can't say it cause it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore<end_line>
People just get sick cause you spit, these fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore <end_line>
And you could never break my stride, you'll never slow the momentum at any moment<end_line>
I'm 'bout to blow, you'll never take my pride, I'm killin the flow, slow venom any opponent<end_line>
is gettin no, mercy mark my words, ain't lettin up, relentless I smell blood<end_line>
I don't give a fuck! Keep givin 'em hell, where was you when I fell and needed help up?<end_line>
You get no love<end_line>
