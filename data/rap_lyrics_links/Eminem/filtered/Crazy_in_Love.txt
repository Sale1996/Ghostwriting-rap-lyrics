Can't you see what you do to me baby?<end_line>
You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac<end_line>
I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick<end_line>
You're truly the only one who can do this to me<end_line>
You just make me get so crazy<end_line>
I go schizo, I get so insane I just go schizophrenic<end_line>
One minute I want to slit your throat, the next I wanted sex<end_line>
You make me crazy, the way we act like two maniacs in the sack<end_line>
We fuck like two jackrabbits and maybe that's a bad habit<end_line>
Cause the next day we're right back at it<end_line>
In the same exact pattern<end_line>
What the fuck is the matter with us?<end_line>
We can't figure out if it's lust<end_line>
or it's love which that is attractin us to each other<end_line>
They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother<end_line>
Which would explain why you're such a motherfuckin bitch<end_line>
but I stay and still stick it out with you<end_line>
even though I just hit you today<end_line>
But you deserve it you hit me first and provoked me to choke you<end_line>
Just cause I came home late last night crawled in bed and I woke you<end_line>
But if there's one thing about you that I admire it's baby<end_line>
Because you stay with me, maybe, because you're as crazy as I am<end_line>
Cause when I look at you I can see an angel in your eyes<end_line>
But if I look deeper inside I see your freakish little side<end_line>
Like a devil in disguise, you're always full of surprises<end_line>
Always pullin devices out your personal vibrators and dildos<end_line>
You fucked yourself so much you barely feel those anymore<end_line>
You're only 24 but you're plenty more ma-ture<end_line>
than those other little hoes who just act like little girls<end_line>
Like they're in middle school still you're crazy sexy cool, chillin<end_line>
You play your position you never step out of line<end_line>
Even though I stay in your business you've always kept out of mine<end_line>
I wonder what's on your mind, sometimes they say love is blind<end_line>
Maybe that's why the first time I dotted your eye you ain't see the sign<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
You are the ink to my paper, what my pen is to my pad<end_line>
The moral, the very fiber, the whole substance to my rap<end_line>
You are my reason for being, the meaning of my existence<end_line>
If it wasn't for you I would never be able to spit this<end_line>
as intense as I do and the irony is you rely on me<end_line>
as much as I rely on you to inspire me like you do<end_line>
You provide me the lighter fluid, the fuel to my fire<end_line>
You're my entire supply - gas, the match, and igniter<end_line>
The only way that I am able to stay so stable is you're the legs to my table<end_line>
If you were to break I'd fall on my face<end_line>
But I'm always gonna make you feel I don't need you as much<end_line>
as I really need you so you don't use it to your advantage<end_line>
But you're essential to me you're the air I breathe I believe<end_line>
if you ever leave me I'd probably have no reason to be<end_line>
You are the Kim to my Marshall you're the Slim to my Shady<end_line>
The Dre to my Eminem, the Elaina to my Hailie<end_line>
You are the words that I'm lookin for when I'm tryin to describe<end_line>
how I feel inside and the right one just won't come to my mind<end_line>
You're like the pillar that props me up, the beam that supports me<end_line>
The bitch who never took half, the wife who never divorced me<end_line>
You're like the root to my evil, you let my devil come out me<end_line>
You let me beat the shit out you before you beat the shit out me<end_line>
