<verse_start>
For whatever it's worth, it's worth me havin my ass whipped<end_line>
Cause I'ma have the last lips to ever kiss ass with<end_line>
I just can't get passed these little piss ants<end_line>
that wanna be Barney bad asses so bad<end_line>
And they so mad they can't stand it, cause we can and they can't spit<end_line>
And they can't handle it like a man<end_line>
And that's when it just happens and I snap then it's a wrap<end_line>
Then it's a scrap and it isn't rap, is it?<end_line>
Hip-hop isn't a sport anymore<end_line>
when you gotta go and resort back into that shit<end_line>
Maybe I'm old-fashioned, but my passion<end_line>
is to smash anyone rappin without havin to slap him<end_line>
Believe me, I'd much rather lift a pencil than a pistol<end_line>
when I'm pissed now, but it all depends on just how<end_line>
far it gets took on the mic<end_line>
Cause I'm tellin you right now you're not gonna like it<end_line>
Cause if I get pushed over the edge then I'm pullin you with me<end_line>
You poke a stick at a pitbull you get bit B<end_line>
Your words stick to you like crazy glue when you diss me<end_line>
Cause they just bounce off me, like bullets do 50<end_line>
I'm the beautiful instinct, and you're gonna miss me<end_line>
when I'm gone, like Keith Murray when he threw his stool<end_line>
and hit a girl accidentally<end_line>
I do this with Swifty, Kon and Kuniva, Bizzy and Proof - are you with me?<end_line>
