Sittin in the back of the, all-gray Acura<end_line>
Gun to the passenger for actin tough<end_line>
Turn the wheel in the passin, heart of an assassin<end_line>
Plus I'm on the draw down, quick as fuck<end_line>
Last move 'fore I give all street shit up<end_line>
Put a nigga in the ground face down, feet up<end_line>
This nigga here tried to cuff me for my re-up<end_line>
When I went to his crib he called police up<end_line>
Now you on the way to bein paraplegic<end_line>

A hundred in beats, beatin the shit out skinheads<end_line>

I'm Ca$his, a real dope boy on the beat<end_line>
Slumped in the seat tucked clutchin the heat<end_line>
Basically, you niggaz can't fuck with me, hah<end_line>
