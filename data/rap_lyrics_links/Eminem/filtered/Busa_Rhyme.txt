Well I do pop pills, I keep my tube socks filled<end_line>
and pop the same shit that got Tupac killed<end_line>
Spit game to these hoes, like a soap opera episode<end_line>
and punch a bitch in the nose, til her whole face explodes<end_line>
There's three things I hate: girls, women and bitches<end_line>
I'm that vicious to walk up, and drop-kick midgets<end_line>
They call me Boogie Night, the stalker that walks awkward<end_line>
Stick figure, with a dick bigger than Mark Wahlberg<end_line>
Comin through the airport, sluggish, walkin on crutches<end_line>
Hit a fuckinin herwith luggage<end_line>
It's like a dream I can't snap out, I black out, and back out<end_line>
I'm lookin for someone "of" to beat the crap "out"<end_line>
I'm bringin you rap singers two middle fingers<end_line>
I flip you off in French, then translate in English<end_line>
Then I'ma vanish off the face of the planet and come back<end_line>
speakin so much Spanish, Pun can't even understand it<end_line>
<verse_end>

I had a huge attitude, started off staticky<end_line>
Mad at you, had you mad at me automatically<end_line>
I'm not a commodity, I'm an oddity<end_line>
who oddly enough developed himself a Halloween following<end_line>
It's so big, if I counted up all the freaks who follow me<end_line>
I'd probably owe Ozzy Osbourne an apology<end_line>
College girls, live in an alcoholic's world<end_line>
full of earl, head twirls every time the toilet swirls *flush*<end_line>
Covered in throw-up, and I refuse to grow up<end_line>
I won't budge, I still tell a grown-up to shut up<end_line>
I made this rap game suspenseful, cause now I got a impulse<end_line>
to give you insults wrote with a pencil<end_line>
and waste the paper on you, choppin down the oakwood<end_line>
Cause everything that you wrote in your notebook was no good<end_line>
And as long as I stay in the studio and keep cuttin<end_line>
You motherfuckers are puttin your words together for nuttin<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I'm homicidal, and suicidal with no friends<end_line>
Holdin a gun with no handle, just a barrel at both ends<end_line>
Sprayin tecs at you until you see your fuckin legs<end_line>
with the bullet holes and the exit wounds layin next to you<end_line>
 Fuckin mad dog, foamin at the mouth<end_line>
Fuck mouth, my whole house, is foamin at the couch<end_line>
Jumped out of the 93rd floor of a building<end_line>
and shot every window out on the way down to the ground<end_line>
Woke up to a hospital staff, got up and laughed, chopped em in half<end_line>
Suffocated the oxygen mask<end_line>
Shit if I get any higher, I'ma get the East and West beefin again<end_line>
Slide back to Detroit and stand in the crossfire<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Uhh.. one-two<end_line>
Misdemeanor, Slim Shady<end_line>
Timbaland, motherfucker<end_line>
Uhh uhh uhh<end_line>
Cool, cool, cool<end_line>
Triple zero<end_line>
<verse_end>
