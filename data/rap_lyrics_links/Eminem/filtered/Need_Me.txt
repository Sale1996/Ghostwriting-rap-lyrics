<verse_start>
Startin to think we were made for each other<end_line>
But one of us in this relationship is raisin the other<end_line>
You remind me of my mother, we drive one another crazy as each other<end_line>
And we're both adults so there's no excuse for the games that we play with each other<end_line>
Where you at? At a friend's? No you ain't, motherfucker!<end_line>
But I give her the benefit of the doubt whenever the doubt kicks in, shiver<end_line>
when I touch her cause I love her so much, I'm a sucker, our bottom lip can quiver<end_line>
When she's in trouble she's in hot water, think I caught her cheatin again, give her<end_line>
'nother chance, 'nother one after that, I'm swimmin in that Egyptian river<end_line>
Cause I'm in denial/da Nile, say I don't eat shit, but I got a shit-eatin grin when I smile<end_line>
Makin an excuse for us to act it out, she's just actin out, with her inner child<end_line>
Then I set the truth on fire cause I'd rather believe a lie than to breathe a sigh<end_line>
of relief, I don't believe in, goin to bed mad, I keep on tryin<end_line>
to make a bad girl good, but haven't I stood by you in good times?<end_line>
And bad? I'm startin to feel like your goddamn dad, cause I literally feel like you could die<end_line>
of a "Should I, leave you for good?" so never would I<end_line>
It'd be all bad, huh, never understood why they call it good-bye<end_line>
But I think I'm a pretty damn good guy - and you're a good person too<end_line>
I can save you, I can make you, change but I keep puttin my fuckin foot in my<end_line>
mouth every time I gotta come and bail you out<end_line>
When you get in trouble that you get yourself in amid trouble but I can't leave, I'd sell you out<end_line>
I could never turn my fuckin back on you, what is that? I'm co-dependent<end_line>
I'm just now noticin it, but somehow it's like every time I'm about to go to end it<end_line>
I ain't got the cojones to do it, nor the heart, our apartment's tore apart<end_line>
You're usin my heart for a dart board, but God must've aligned stars for us<end_line>
Cause somebody paired us up, and they say He ain't capable of makin a mistake<end_line>
But this one's perfect cause I'm<end_line>
