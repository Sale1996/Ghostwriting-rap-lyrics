<verse_start>
Left the keys in the van, with a gat in each hand<end_line>
Went up in Eastland and shot a policeman<end_line>
Fuck a peace plan, if a citizen bystands<end_line>
the shit is in my hands, here's yo' life span<end_line>
And for what yo' life's worth; this money is twice than<end_line>
You grab a couple grand and lay up in Iceland<end_line>
See I'm a nice man but money turned me to Satan<end_line>
I'm thirsty for this green so bad I'm dehydratin<end_line>
Hurry up with the cash bitch, I got a ride waitin<end_line>
Shot a man twice in the back when he tried escapin<end_line>
I want the whole pie, I won't be denied nathan<end_line>
Maybe I need my head inside straightened<end_line>
Brain contemplatin, clean out the register<end_line>
Dip before somebody catches ya<end_line>
or gets ya description and sketches ya<end_line>
Then connects you as the prime suspect<end_line>
But I ain't set to flee the scene of the crime just yet<end_line>
Cause I got a daughter to feed<end_line>
And $200 ain't enough to water the seed, the best thing<end_line>
would be for me to leave Taco Bell and hit up Chess King<end_line>
And have the lady at the desk bring<end_line>
money from the safe in the back, stepped in wavin the Mac<end_line>
Cooperate and we can operate and save an attack<end_line>
This bitch tried escapin the jack<end_line>
Grabbed her by the throat, it's murder she wrote<end_line>
You barely heard a word as she choked<end_line>
It wasn't nuttin for her to be smoked<end_line>
Then I slammed her on her back 'til her vertebrae broke<end_line>
Just then the pigs bust in yellin "Freeze!"<end_line>
But I'm already wanted for sellin ki's<end_line>
And bunch of other felonies from A to Z like spellin bees<end_line>
So before I dropped to the ground and fell on knees<end_line>
I bust shots, they bust back<end_line>
Hit the square in the chest, he wasn't wearin a vest<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Left the house, pullin out the drive backin out<end_line>
We were backin out this lady's Jag started blackin out<end_line>
Pulled the Mac-10 out, stuck it in her face<end_line>
Shut ya yakkin mouth, 'fore I blow the brain from out the back ya scalp<end_line>
Drug her by her hair, smacked her up<end_line>
Thinkin fuck it, mug her while you're there, jacked her up<end_line>
Stole her car, made a profit<end_line>
Grabbed the tape from out the deck and offed it out the window<end_line>
like the girl on "Set it Off" did<end_line>
Jetted off kid, stole the whip, now I'm a criminal<end_line>
Drove it through somebody's yard, dove into they swimmin pool<end_line>
Climbed out and collapsed on the patio<end_line>
I made it out alive but I'm injured badly though<end_line>
Parents screamin: "Son, go in and call the police<end_line>
Tell 'em there's a crazy man disturbing all of the peace!"<end_line>
Tried to stall him at least long enough to let me leap up<end_line>
Run in they crib and at least leave with some little cheap stuff<end_line>
Actin like they never seen nobody hit a lick before<end_line>
Smashed the window, grabbed the Nintendo 64<end_line>
When they sell out in stores the price triples<end_line>
I ran up the block jumpin kids on tricycles<end_line>
And collided with an 80-year old lady with groceries<end_line>
There goes the cheese, eggs, milk and Post Toasties<end_line>
Stood up and started to see stars<end_line>
Too many siren sounds, it seemed like a thousand police cars<end_line>
Barely escaped, musta been some dumb luck<end_line>
Jumped up and climbed the back of a movin dump truck<end_line>
But I think somebody seen me maybe<end_line>
Plus I lost the damn Nintendo and I must-a dropped the Beanie Baby<end_line>
Fuck it I give up, I'm surrounded in blue suits<end_line>
Came out with a white flag hollerin "TRUCE TRUCE!"<end_line>
Surrendered my weapon to cops<end_line>
Wasn't me!  It was the gangsta rap and the peppermint Schnapps<end_line>
<verse_end>
