There's several different levels to Devil worshippin': horse's heads<end_line>
Human sacrifices, canibalism, candles and exorcism<end_line>
Animals having sex with 'em, camels, mammals and rabbits<end_line>
But I don't get into that, I kick the habit, I just<end_line>
Beat you to death with weapons that eat through the flesh<end_line>
And I never eat you unless the fuckin', meat looks fresh<end_line>
I got a lion in my pocket, I'm lyin'<end_line>
I got a nine in my pocket, and baby I'm just<end_line>
Dyin' to cock him<end_line>
He's ready for war<end_line>
I'm ready for war<end_line>
I got machetes and swords for any faggot that said he was raw<end_line>
My uzis<end_line>
Heavy as yours, yeah you met me before<end_line>
I just didn't have as large an arsenal of weapons before<end_line>
Marshall will step in the door<end_line>
I lay your head on the floor<end_line>
With your body spread on the bedspread<end_line>
Red on the wall<end_line>
Red on the ceilin', red on the floor, get a new whore<end_line>
Met on the second, wet on the third, then she's dead on the fourth<end_line>
I'm dead wrong<end_line>
