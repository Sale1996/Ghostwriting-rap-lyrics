Too bad bitch, your gonna finally hear me out this time<end_line>
At first, I'm like all right<end_line>
You wanna throw me out? That's fine!<end_line>
But not for him to take my place, are you out you're mind?<end_line>

Hey remember the time we went to Brian's party?<end_line>
And you were like so drunk that you threw up all over Archie<end_line>
That was funny wasn't it?<end_line>

See it all makes sense, doesn't it?<end_line>
You and your husband have a fight<end_line>
One of you tries to grab a knife<end_line>
And during the struggle he accidentally gets his Adam's apple sliced<end_line>
And while this is goin' on<end_line>
His son just woke up and he just walks in<end_line>
She panics and he gets his throat cut<end_line>
So now they both dead and you slash your own throat<end_line>
So now it's double homicide and suicide with no note<end_line>
I should have known better when you started to act weird<end_line>
We could've...HEY! Where you going? Get back here!<end_line>
