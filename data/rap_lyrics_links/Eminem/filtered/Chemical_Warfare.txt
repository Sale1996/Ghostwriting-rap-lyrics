<verse_start>
Got an axe and a duffle bag, couple of fags<end_line>
stuffed in the backseat, muzzled and gagged<end_line>
Wrapped in bubble-wrap two lesbians up, couple Hustler mags<end_line>
And I grab a Pez dispenser, fill it up to the max<end_line>
with muscle relaxers, the governor of Alaska<end_line>
She loves when I ask her, shove my Polaski<end_line>
sausage up in her ass, huh, while we hover over Nebraska<end_line>
shooting at the fuckin buffalo pasture<end_line>
in the helicopter, man I can't fuck her no faster<end_line>
She's screamin "Grab my titties, Shady suck on those bastards"<end_line>
But I ain't no sucker, I won't snuggle up with her after<end_line>
I'm a gigolo, but y'all look like a juggalo rapper<end_line>
Every day man I just seem to get a little bit doper<end_line>
Shit, back down, man I'd rather lick on a scrotum<end_line>
And eat the fuckin Octo-mom's pussy lips with some okra<end_line>
while I watch, Whoopi Goldberg, sizzle with Oprah<end_line>
While Rosie pussy-farts and takes a piss on the sofa<end_line>
Get a boner, and play dick-swords with the Jonas<end_line>
Brothers; your motherfuckin mother's aroma's<end_line>
like no other, I keep thinkin of her smothered in Somas<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
It's chemical warfare, drop bombs like Saddam<end_line>
I'm bringin the drama, like Barack Obama<end_line>
Playin Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots with the Octo-momma<end_line>
I'm vato loco homie, I cock those llamas<end_line>
For chemical warfare<end_line>
