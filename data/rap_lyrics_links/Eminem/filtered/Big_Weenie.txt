<verse_start>
Alright listen, I need you to focus<end_line>
I need you to go dig deep in your mind, this is important<end_line>
We are going to perform an experiment of the sorts<end_line>
I'm going to have to ask you to bear with me for a moment<end_line>
Now I need you to open, your mind - your eyes close 'em<end_line>
You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis<end_line>
For the next four and a half minutes, we are going to explore<end_line>
into your mind to find out why you're so fucking jealous<end_line>
Now why did they make Yoo-Hoo?  Hippity ga-ga boo-boo<end_line>
Psych I'm kidding, I just wanted to see if you're still listening<end_line>
Okay, now I need your undivided attention<end_line>
Sir I have a question - why do I always sense this<end_line>
undeniable tension, from the moment that I enter into the room<end_line>
It gets all quiet and whispers<end_line>
Whenever there's conversation, why am I always mentioned?<end_line>
I've been dying to ask, it's been itchin at me, is it just because<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Alright now I, I just flubbed a line<end_line>
I was going to say something extremely important<end_line>
But I forgot who or what it was - I fucked up<end_line>
Psych I'm kidding again you idiot, no I didn't<end_line>
That's just what you wanted to hear from me is that I fucked up, ain't it?<end_line>
But I can bust one take without lookin at no paper<end_line>
It doesn't take a bunch of takes or me to stand here in this booth all day<end_line>
For me to say the truth, okay?  You're drooling, you have tooth decay<end_line>
Your mouth is open, you're disgusting, what the fuck you eat for lunch?<end_line>
A bunch of sweets or something, what? You munch a bunch of Crunch 'N Munch?<end_line>
Your tooth is rotten to the gum, tour breath stinks, wanna chew some gum?<end_line>
Yes I do sir, what am I on?  You sir are on truth serum<end_line>
Marshall I'm so jealous of you, please say you won't tell nobody<end_line>
I'd be so embarrassed, I'm just absolutely terrified<end_line>
That someone's gonna find out why I'm saying all these terrible<end_line>
evil and awful mean things, it's my own insecurity!<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Alright now we, we're going to conduct<end_line>
That experiment that we were talking about earlier<end_line>
Just to see what a frog, looks like when it takes two hits of ecstasy<end_line>
Cause that's exactly what your eyes look like, want to check to see?<end_line>
Here's a mirror, notice the resemblence here?<end_line>
Wait, let me put these sunglasses on, now look in this mirror<end_line>
How about now?  What do you have in common?<end_line>
You're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on 'em<end_line>
You look like I sound like, singing about weenies<end_line>
Now take my weenie out of your mouth<end_line>
This is between me and you, I know you're not happy<end_line>
I know you'd much rather see me lying in the corner of a room<end_line>
somewhere crying, curled up in a ball tweaked out of my mind dying<end_line>
There is no denying that my weenie is much bigger than yours is<end_line>
Mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges<end_line>
Why you even doing this to yourself, it's pointless<end_line>
Why do we have to keep on going through this, this is tortureous<end_line>
My point is this - that if you say mean things, your weenie will shrink<end_line>
Now I forgot what the chorus is, you're just a..<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Get the fuck off my dick! <end_line>
<verse_end>
