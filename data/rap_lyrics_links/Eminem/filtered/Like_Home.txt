Someone get this Aryan a sheet<end_line>
Time to bury him so tell him to prepare to get impeached<end_line>
Everybody on your feet<end_line>
This is where terrorism and, heroism meets, square off in the street<end_line>
This chump barely even sleeps<end_line>
All he does is watch Fox News like a parrot and repeats<end_line>
While he looks like a canary with a beak<end_line>
Why you think he banned transgenders from the military with a tweet?<end_line>
He's tryin to divide us<end_line>
The shit's like a cult, but like Johnny he'll only +Unite-us+<end_line>
Cause nothin inside us drives us like this fight does<end_line>
Similar to when two cars collide cause<end_line>
Our spirit's crushed, and this spot's a tight one<end_line>
But here the jaws of life come<end_line>
To pull us from the wreckage, that's what we get pried/pride from<end_line>
When we can't from our stars and stripes cause<end_line>
This type of pickle that we're in's hard to dill/deal<end_line>
But there's always tomorrow still<end_line>
If we start from scratch, like a scab, get the scars to heal<end_line>
And, band together for Charlottesville<end_line>
And for Heather, fallen heroes, fill his wall with murals<end_line>
Nevada get up, hit the damn resetter, let's start from zero<end_line>
This is our renewal, spray tan get rid of<end_line>
Get a brand new better America, and here's to where we are<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Didn't wanna piss your base off, did ya?<end_line>
Can't denounce the Klan cause they play golf wit ya<end_line>
You stay on Twitter<end_line>
Way to get your hate off Nazi, I do not see a way y'all differ<end_line>
And all you got are race cards bigot, the swastika with your name carved<end_line>
in it should be your trademark, cause hate's all you played off<end_line>
And you just lick the plate off<end_line>
So I guess it pays to feed off of chaos, so basically you're Adolf Hitler!<end_line>
But you ain't ruinin our country, punk<end_line>
Or takin our pride from us, you won't define us<end_line>
Cause like a dictionary, things are lookin up<end_line>
so much, got a sprained neck, know we will rise up<end_line>
against this trainwreck, and take a stand<end_line>
Even if it means sittin when they raise the flag<end_line>
to sing "The Star-Spangled Banner"<end_line>
This man just praised a statue of General Lee<end_line>
cause he generally hates the black people, degrades hispanics<end_line>
Take it back to the Shady National Convention<end_line>
Wish I woulda spit on it before I went to shake his hand at<end_line>
the event, or maybe had the wherewithal<end_line>
to know that he was gonna try to tear apart<end_line>
our sacred land we cherish and stand for<end_line>
So, hands in the air, let's hear it for<end_line>
the start of a brand new America<end_line>
without him, and be proud of where we're from<end_line>
And here's to where we are<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I won't give up<end_line>
I won't give up on my home that so many died for<end_line>
You already know that I won't give up<end_line>
I won't give up on my home that so many died for<end_line>
You already know, there's no place like home<end_line>
No place like home, wherever I go<end_line>
No place like home, no place like home<end_line>
No place like home, wherever I go<end_line>
