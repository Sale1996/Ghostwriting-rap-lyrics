<verse_start>
Nobody better test me, cuz I don't wanna get messy<end_line>
Especially when I step inside this bitch, dick freshly<end_line>
New Lugz, give the crew hugs, guzzle two mugs<end_line>
Before I do drugs that make me throw up like flu bugs<end_line>
True thugs, rugged unshaven messy scrubs<end_line>
Whippin' 40-bottles like the fuckin' Pepsi clubs<end_line>
Down a fifth, crack open a six<end_line>
I'm on my seventh 8-ball, now I gotta take a piss<end_line>
I'm hollerin' at these hoes that got boyfriends<end_line>
Who gives a fuck who they was<end_line>
I'm always takin' someone else's girl like Cool J does<end_line>
They probably don't be packin' anyways, do they Fuzz?<end_line>
We walked up, stomped they asses and blew they buzz<end_line>
Mics get sandblasted<end_line>
Stab your abdomen with a hand crafted pocketknife and spill your antacid<end_line>
Sprayed your motherfuckin' crib up when I ran past it<end_line>
Fuckin' felon, headed to hell in a handbasket<end_line>
Talkin' shit will get you, your girl and your man blasted<end_line>
Kidnapped and slapped in a van wrapped in Saran plastic<end_line>
Get your damn ass kicked, by these fantastic<end_line>
Furious four motherfuckers<end_line>
Flashin' in front of your face without the Grand Masters<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
You have now witnessed 4 ill emcees!<end_line>
From the home of potholes and trash<end_line>
We'll lyrically blast...<end_line>
<verse_end>
