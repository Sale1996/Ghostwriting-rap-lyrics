You never met me, and you'll probably never see me again<end_line>

You ride like a cowboy toward the sun<end_line>
And life ain't fun, when you're on the run<end_line>
Got your gold and you got your gun<end_line>
But life as an outlaw just begun<end_line>
Got your shotgun by your side<end_line>
Got your horse and you got your pride<end_line>
You ride til there ain't no place to hide<end_line>
It's sad cause the bad guys always die<end_line>

He was "Shady," I seen by the look on his face<end_line>
He said take ten pacesI took eight<end_line>
Spun around and I aimed straight for the brain<end_line>
Mywent bang but it only fired a blank, he said<end_line>
I put a clip in the gun, and pointed at his lungs<end_line>
We both drew at the same time and stood stunned<end_line>
I figured he was tellin the truth, that's why I didn't shoot<end_line>
So what we gon' do, it's on you<end_line>
The Chronic!<end_line>
Loaded up my saddle, got ready for battle<end_line>
Hid two pieces of gold inside of my saddle <end_line>
We rolled two miles until we hit the spot<end_line>
An old ghost town that everybody forgot<end_line>
A place where they used to smoke chronic a lot<end_line>
Slim grabbed the shotgun<end_line>

This is the spot, they call him Doc Loveless<end_line>
He's goin around sayin he took the game from us<end_line>
But he ain't got no legs, they cut 'em off at the stomach<end_line>
He's got mechanical legs, he spins webs<end_line>
Plus he's well respected by the hip-hop heads<end_line>
Our mission - is to get him to stop layin eggs<end_line>
And we can put him on his back down a flight of steps<end_line>

That's when I seen Dre in trouble and came with the gauge<end_line>
I fired the first shot, spun his body around<end_line>
He hit the ground and landed upside down<end_line>

I grabbed two girlies and athat's rolled<end_line>
