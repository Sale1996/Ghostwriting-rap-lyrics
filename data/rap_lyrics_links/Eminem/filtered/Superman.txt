<verse_start>
They call me Superman<end_line>
Leap tall hoes in a single bound, I'm single now<end_line>
Got no ring on this finger now<end_line>
I'd never let another chick bring me down<end_line>
in a relationship, save it bitch<end_line>
Babysit? You make me sick<end_line>
Superman ain't savin shit<end_line>
Girl you can jump on Shady's dick<end_line>
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase<end_line>
I tell a muh'fuckin slut to her face<end_line>
Play no games, say no names<end_line>
Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face<end_line>
I'm a different man, kiss my ass<end_line>
Kiss my lips, bitch why ask?<end_line>
Kiss my dick - get my cash?<end_line>
I'd rather have you whip my ass<end_line>
Don't put out, I'll put you out<end_line>
Won't get out, I'll push you out<end_line>
Puss blew out, poppin shit<end_line>
Wouldn't piss on fire to put you out<end_line>
Am I too nice, to buy you ice?<end_line>
Bitch if you died, wouldn't buy you life<end_line>
What you tryin to be my new wife?<end_line>
What you Mariah? Fly through twice<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
But I do know one thing though<end_line>
Bitches, they come they go<end_line>
Saturday through Sunday, Monday<end_line>
Monday through Sunday yo<end_line>
Maybe I'll love you one day<end_line>
Maybe we'll someday grow<end_line>
'Til then just sit your drunk ass<end_line>
on that fuckin runway ho<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Don't get me wrong -  I love these hoes<end_line>
It's no secret, everybody knows<end_line>
Yeah we fucked, bitch so what?<end_line>
That's about as far as your buddy goes<end_line>
We'll be friends, I'll call you again<end_line>
I'll chase you around every bar you attend<end_line>
Never know what kind of car I'll be in<end_line>
We'll see how much you'll be partyin then<end_line>
You don't want that, neither do I<end_line>
I don't want to flip when I see you with guys<end_line>
Too much pride, between you and I<end_line>
Not a jealous man but females lie<end_line>
But I guess that's just what sluts do<end_line>
How could it ever be just us two?<end_line>
I'd never love you enough to trust you<end_line>
We just met and I just fucked you<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
First thing you say, "I'm not fazed<end_line>
I hang around big stars all day<end_line>
I don't see what the big deal is anyway<end_line>
you're just plain old Marshall to me"<end_line>
Ooh yea girl run that game<end_line>
"Hailie Jade? I love that name!<end_line>
Love that tattoo - what's that say?<end_line>
Rot in pieces? Uh, that's great"<end_line>
First off you don't know Marshall<end_line>
at all so don't grow partial<end_line>
That's ammo for my arsenal<end_line>
I'll slap you off that bar stool<end_line>
There goes another lawsuit<end_line>
Leave handprints all across you<end_line>
Good Lordy whodi<end_line>
you must be gone off that water bottle<end_line>
You want what you can't have<end_line>
Ooh girl that's too damn bad<end_line>
Don't touch what you can't grab<end_line>
End up with two backhands<end_line>
Put anthrax on a tampax<end_line>
and slap you 'til you can't stand<end_line>
Girl you just blew your chance<end_line>
Don't mean to ruin your plans<end_line>
<verse_end>
