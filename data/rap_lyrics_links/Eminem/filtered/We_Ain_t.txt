Hahahaha, ladies and gentlemen<end_line>
You are now about to witness the strength, Aftermath<end_line>
Straight out the motherfuckin streets of Compton<end_line>

Only Dre can, judge me for the mistakes I'm makin<end_line>
If I'm fakin, I'm Clay Aiken<end_line>
You ain't 50 and you ain't Game, you lame you tame bitch<end_line>
You're mild sauce, you ain't ready to make that flame switch<end_line>
You'll end up in the same situation, same shit<end_line>
Different day, just with different gangsters in your face, which<end_line>
way do you wanna face when your brains hit pavement<end_line>
Think of what you'll say to Pastor Ma$e and save it<end_line>

Eminem battles to ward off, accusations<end_line>
That he had somebody blasted, the mask of Jason<end_line>
was found at the scene of the task with masking tape<end_line>
And the victim's penis up his ass, a basket case<end_line>
And they ask him to clean up his act, you bastards wastin<end_line>
