<verse_start>
Ih.. ih, ih<end_line>
It has been, it has been, it has been<end_line>
It has been said, that there has been known to be bloodshed<end_line>
Over bread, men who have bled to death, dead<end_line>
Strapped to beds, pipe bombs, dynamite, lead<end_line>
Money power respect, street cred, yeah<end_line>
It's scary ain't it? Picture yourself goin out as a hero<end_line>
Picture mural pictures of us painted all over street corners<end_line>
Fans meet to mourn us, while we meet the coroners<end_line>
Notorious tried to warn us<end_line>
We watched, so many Biggie backed off of<end_line>
Biggie's back and 'Pac's, landmarks, history in rap<end_line>
Statistically in fact; it's so sad to see us re-enact<end_line>
these tragic events, which lead us back<end_line>
To where we left off on March 9th<end_line>
To come from such hard knock lifes<end_line>
And make it up out of 'em, hit the spotlights<end_line>
And, once they're on us this is our lives<end_line>
Thrust out for all eyes to cast upon us<end_line>
to see who can last the longest<end_line>
And he who lasts the longest, must be the strongest<end_line>
In this concrete jungle, where this dog eat dog mentality comes from<end_line>
It's origin, which is usually originated from cats who starvin<end_line>
Or it could just be somebody's horror, that just horri-fies<end_line>
And applies to his persona or the sizes<end_line>
in his entou-rage, that intimidates the people<end_line>
To the point that you know that he's gangster<end_line>
He ain't just say shit, you just believe it<end_line>
