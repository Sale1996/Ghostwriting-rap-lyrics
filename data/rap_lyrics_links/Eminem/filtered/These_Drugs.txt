My music is therapeutic for whoever's there to use it<end_line>
It's like, Lucifer's here to influence listeners through it<end_line>
You probably do what it said to do just from listenin to it<end_line>
It's got the power to get you to do it<end_line>
So when the shit comes on, I wanna see some shit jump off<end_line>
Some bitch get slapped, some motherfuckin kid get stomped<end_line>
So get this song, go run out and buy this disc<end_line>
And try this shit, as much coke as I just did<end_line>
Cause times like these, got me doin lines like these<end_line>
Plus I grab a pencil every time that I light weed<end_line>
It's probably because of the drugs Shady does what he does<end_line>
and is what he is, I'm dizzy Bizzy visit these kids<end_line>
