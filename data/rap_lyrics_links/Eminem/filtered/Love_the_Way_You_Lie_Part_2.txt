<verse_start>
This morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face<end_line>
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction<end_line>
Hush baby speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry<end_line>
that you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me!<end_line>
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me<end_line>
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy<end_line>
Baby without you I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me<end_line>
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me<end_line>
Then after that shove me, in the aftermath of the<end_line>
destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths but we<end_line>
know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs<end_line>
that we'll have each other's backs, cause we're that lucky!<end_line>
Together we move mountains<end_line>
Let's not make mountains out of molehills, you hit me twice, yeah but who's countin?<end_line>
I may have hit you three times, I'm startin to lose count<end_line>
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain<end_line>
Our love, is crazy we're nuts, but I refuse counselin<end_line>
This house is too huge, if you move out I'll burn all two thousand<end_line>
square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it<end_line>
Cause with you I'm in my fuckin mind, WITHOUT YOU I'M OUT IT~!<end_line>
<verse_end>
