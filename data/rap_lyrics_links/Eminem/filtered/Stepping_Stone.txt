It's 2002, everything was totally new<end_line>
We were globally huge, watchin sales go through the roof<end_line>
We wrote and we viewed it, Runyon Avenue Soldiers included<end_line>
A multitude of homies who would bounce for no good excuse<end_line>
We were so bullet-proof; wrote, souped and soaked in our youth<end_line>
Thought we was runnin shit 'til we lost the sole of our shoe<end_line>
... The death of Doody broke us in two<end_line>
We were thrown for a loop, ain't none of us know what to do<end_line>
And at the time I was goin through my own struggles too<end_line>
So I wasn't in no condition to be coachin us through<end_line>
Everyone tried to go solo, really nobody blew<end_line>
I was hopin they do so I ain't have to shoulder the crew<end_line>
The plan was put everyone in position so that they knew<end_line>
how to stand on they own, and I don't wanna open up wounds<end_line>
I just noticed the oomph was gone when we go in the booth<end_line>
Cause the truth is the moment that Proof died, so did the group<end_line>

Turn to the river with you<end_line>
Help me leave this all behind<end_line>

It was never the same, and it's bothered me since<end_line>
And the farther we drift apart the more awkward it gets<end_line>
The more time goes by the more life happens<end_line>
And we gotta be men - we got responsibilities<end_line>
Plus we don't say how we feel and I feel like this is what got us in<end_line>
the debacle we're in, been with you guys thick and thin<end_line>
But it's almost as if sometimes we're not even friends<end_line>
Which reminded me Biz, "Rockstar" was the shit<end_line>
Y'all coulda got you a hit without me on the shit, if<end_line>
you woulda put D12 on it, wish I coulda did<end_line>
more than try talkin you into comin up off of it<end_line>
I know it wasn't my fault, but part of it probably is<end_line>
I think of all of the trips to BET and the rappers I wish<end_line>
that we woulda politicked with, maybe y'all coulda clicked<end_line>
And got you some features, but that's water under the bridge<end_line>
But I'm washin my sins in it 'til my conscience is cleansed<end_line>
<verse_end>

Bacardi and Henn', never thought the party would end<end_line>
One minute you're bodyin shit, but then your audience splits<end_line>
You can already sense the climate is starting to shift<end_line>
To these kids you no longer exist<end_line>
Went from rainin cats and dogs in this bitch, to tiny drops, little drips<end_line>
And by the time your reign/rain is over, you'll hardly be missed/mist<end_line>
You start thinkin of all the artists you gift<end_line>
All the carnage you left, is this the kind of karma you get<end_line>
for turnin your fuckin back on Bizzy, Kuniva and Swift?<end_line>
A Freudian slip, subconsciously I honestly wished<end_line>
I ain't feel so much guilt, and y'all didn't harbor resentment<end_line>
But it's hard to pretend that y'all ain't got none, I just wish<end_line>
I had words but I guess, they're just, are none for this<end_line>
To my, partners I can't say how, sorry I am<end_line>
This is, not how I planned for our, story to end<end_line>
I love, all of you man but I just, can't be that guy<end_line>
every-body depends on for entire careers<end_line>
Cause that's, not even fair, I will, always be here<end_line>
But that spark isn't there, and I don't know how to recapture<end_line>
that time and that era, I've tried harkening back to<end_line>
But I'm fightin for air, I'm barely charting myself<end_line>
Feels like I'm on the descent, but it was not my intent<end_line>
to treat y'all like a stepping stone<end_line>
Though I ain't left no one behind but we been, down every road<end_line>
Done all we possibly can, I know we kept our hopes up<end_line>
But the longer we spend, livin this lie that we live<end_line>
The less is left for closure - so let's let this go<end_line>
It's not goodbye to our friendship, but D12 is over<end_line>
