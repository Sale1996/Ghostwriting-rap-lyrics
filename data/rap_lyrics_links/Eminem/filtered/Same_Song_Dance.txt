the whole rapper thing, aren't ya?<end_line>
Probably thinkin you'll get slapped so dang hard ya<end_line>
won't even be able to stand up straight, aren't ya?<end_line>
Couple rape charges people think you're a monster<end_line>
The police constantly buggin you non-stop<end_line>
I walk up on ya, well hello Tonya<end_line>
I think you got your OnStar button inside your car stuck<end_line>
You out of gas? Do you got a flat?<end_line>
I would hate for you to be stranded at the laundry mat, I got your back<end_line>
Why don't you put your laundry baskets in the back<end_line>
and sit up front, I'm not asking, it's a trap<end_line>
You just got jacked and body snatched and it's a wrap<end_line>
In broad day, and no masks for this attack<end_line>
I heard 'em say, exact opposites attract<end_line>
If that's a fact, it'll take taskforce to get you back, c'mon<end_line>

The first victim I had she was a big one<end_line>
Big movie star, a party girl, big fun<end_line>
She was the girl the media always picked on<end_line>
In and out of rehab every 4 to 6 months<end_line>
She was always known for little pranks and slick stunts<end_line>
At Nickelodeon flashed the little kids once<end_line>
What an event it was, I was sitting in front<end_line>
I was hooked in at the first glimpse of them buns<end_line>
Seen her backstage, now here's where I come in son<end_line>
Look here she comes, I'd better pull out the big guns<end_line>
Hello Lindsay, you're lookin a little thin hon<end_line>
How 'bout a ride to rehab? Get in cunt!<end_line>
But starting off on the wrong foot is what I didn't want<end_line>
Girl I'm just kidding, let me start over again hon<end_line>
See what I meant was, we should have a little intervention<end_line>
Come with me to Brighton, let me relieve your tension<end_line>
You little wencher, murder wasn't my intention<end_line>
If I wanted to kill you it would've already been done<end_line>
Slowly she gets in and I begin to<end_line>
lynch her with 66 inches of extension, cord<end_line>

My second victim was even bigger than the first<end_line>
Pop star, icon, the whole works<end_line>
She played the little schoolgirl when she first<end_line>
burst up on the scene, it seemed that the world was hers<end_line>
She twirls and turns and flirts in skirts so bad it hurts<end_line>
It irked me, it made me mad at first<end_line>
I lashed out in my songs, <end_line>
but what was really goin on was that I had developed a crush<end_line>
I just didn't know how to tell it to her<end_line>
Should I cut off one of my ears and mail it to her?<end_line>
Send her pictures of my collection of skeletons or<end_line>
footage of me impalin myself on an elephant tusk?<end_line>
We'll settle this once and for all, I'ma tell her at dusk<end_line>
Tonight, tonight is the night, and tell her I must<end_line>
Creep up to her mansion in stilettos and just<end_line>
Climb the gate and ring the bell like, "Hello my love"<end_line>
I just picked your prescription for Seroquel up<end_line>
Now would you like to share a pill or two with me?<end_line>
I'll share my Valium with you cause I'm feelin you Britney<end_line>
I'll trade you a blue one for a pink one<end_line>
Ever since the schoolgirl juvenile delinquent<end_line>
I've been feelin you, ooh ooh girl you sexy little gal you<end_line>
Hold that pill any longer it'll get sentimental value<end_line>
C'mon toots, give me the Valium alley-oop<end_line>
I'll slam dunk it in your mouth 'til you puke<end_line>
And just as soon as you pass out in your alphabet soup<end_line>
I'm 'bout to, make a new outfit outta you<end_line>
New outfit? Shit I'll make a suit outta you, shoot<end_line>
Now show me how you move, baby do how-a you do<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Same kickin and screamin, same cryin and sobbin<end_line>
Same song and dance<end_line>
Same beggin and pleadin, same yellin and bleedin<end_line>
Same song and dance<end_line>
Yeah, same song and dance<end_line>
I know, same song and dance<end_line>
<verse_end>
