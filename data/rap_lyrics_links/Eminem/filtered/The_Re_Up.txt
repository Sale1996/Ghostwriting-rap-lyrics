<verse_start>
There's never been this, much of a menace in this game as this<end_line>
And it's the, most sinister duo in the business<end_line>
Once again its the, illest and realest killas<end_line>
The most villainous Dre protege, Shady apprentice<end_line>
Drop them zeros and get with these heroes<end_line>
Do you want losers or winners, This music is in us, and it's<end_line>
Not over 'till we say it's finished and G-Unit spinners<end_line>
Will keep spinnin', this is Hip Hop when it's in it's<end_line>
Truest form, the greatest, Hate us or love us<end_line>
Make voodoo dolls of us and keep stickin' those pins in us<end_line>
Thick as his skin is or as short as his wick is<end_line>
The trick is to be able to walk big as his dick is<end_line>
And as sick as his music is, or was, still is<end_line>
Whatever, forever, he will be the illest<end_line>
To ever sh-shock the world, what to do next<end_line>
He's already reconciled with his ex, a chainsaw and an axe<end_line>
Jump a bitch's desk, strangle her neck<end_line>
While we have sex while Bill Clinton plays the sax<end_line>
I sprays the vex, yeah bring Shady on back<end_line>
The maniac of rap, devil baby on crack<end_line>
Resurrect, I never left, baby I'm bad<end_line>
I've gone mad, my comrade Dre-zy automatically<end_line>
He says I'm too broke to fix, way beyond that<end_line>
I may be off drugs, but it's made me off track<end_line>
In fact, this right here very well could be the last rap<end_line>
I ever do spit, I'll never do shit, that's that<end_line>
Fuck it I quit, suck on a dick, jackass<end_line>
I'm done with this wack ass rap, kiss my black ass!<end_line>
