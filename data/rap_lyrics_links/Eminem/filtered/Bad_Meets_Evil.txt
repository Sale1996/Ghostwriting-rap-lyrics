I don't speak, I float in the air wrapped in a sheet<end_line>
I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat<end_line>
I translate when my voice is read through a sismograph<end_line>
And a noise is bred, picked up and transmitted through Royce's head<end_line>
Trapped him in his room, possessed him and hoist his bed<end_line>
Till the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead<end_line>
Told him each one of his boys is dead<end_line>
I asked him to come to the dark side, he made a choice and said<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Cuz this is what happens when Bad Meets Evil<end_line>
We hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people<end_line>
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Segal<end_line>
Above the Law cuz I don't agree wit police either<end_line>
We ain't eager to be legal<end_line>
So please leave me wit the keys to your Jeep Eagle<end_line>
I breathe ether in three amounts<end_line>
When I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle<end_line>
Releasin rage on anybody in squeezing range<end_line>
Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain<end_line>
No I'm not, I just want to shoot up and I'm pissed off<end_line>
Cuz I can't find a decent vain<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I used to be a loudmouth, remember me?<end_line>
I'm the one who burned your house down<end_line>
Well I'm out now, and this time I'm comin back to blow your house up<end_line>
And I ain't gon leave you a window to jump out of<end_line>
Give me two fat tabs and three shrooms<end_line>
And you won't see me like fat people in steam rooms<end_line>
And when I go to hell and I'm gettin ready to leave<end_line>
I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Cuz this is what happens when Bad Meets Evil<end_line>
And we hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people<end_line>
He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Segal<end_line>
Against peaceful, see you in hell for the sequel<end_line>
See you in hell<end_line>
Wall Street, Royce Da Five-Nine, Slim Shady<end_line>
See you in hell for the sequel<end_line>
Bad Meets Evil, what?<end_line>
