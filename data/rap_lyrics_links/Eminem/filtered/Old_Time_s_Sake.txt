Speak of the devil it's attack of the Rainman<end_line>
Chainsaw in hand, bloodstain on my apron<end_line>
Soon as the blade spun, vrunn, they run away from<end_line>
Who wanna play dungeon, no one is safe from<end_line>
In search of a brain surgeon, a great one<end_line>
Wait, it ain't funny man it's urgent, I need one<end_line>
Two boxes of detergent and a paint gun<end_line>
And an emergency squirt gun to spray A-1, so<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Smoke signal in the sky like Verizon Wireless<end_line>
A nice environment, surprised entirely<end_line>
Hypotized by the sound, I surround the hydrants<end_line>
Takin lives of firemen<end_line>
Say goodbye, here I am again; naked wives and Vicodin<end_line>
Before I begin to get so high pussy bwoy I could spin<end_line>
Vinn, vinn; fuck the handle I fly off the hinge<end_line>
Let that boy off the bench coach and throw it to him<end_line>
There he goes in his trenchcoat, no clothes again<end_line>
Baby make us some french toast and show us some skin<end_line>
I'll show you every inch grows on my fore-a-skin<end_line>
Show me nipple, I'm pinch both and throw up a ten<end_line>
Now you know it's a sin to tease, blow us again<end_line>
The sorcerer of intercourse, if it's forced it's him<end_line>
Don't fight the feelin if you're feelin the force within<end_line>
Then when you wake up in the morning next to the porcelain, so<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Nuh-uh, he ain't playin<end_line>
He's gon' get the AK and aim it right at your brai-ain<end_line>
I'm slightly insa-ane, vodka and Creatine<end_line>
Hypnotiq and Red Bull, it's an incredible energy drink<end_line>
And it's "giving me wings," +I Believe I Can Fly+<end_line>
While I pee on the girl, you won't catch me C.S.I.<end_line>
It's as easy as pie, and as simple as cake<end_line>
Dre get on the mic and make 'em tremble and shake<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Well smoke enough for me, fuck yeah, light it up Cheech<end_line>
C'mon, smoke me out cuz, give me contact buzz<end_line>
Get me on track, they love me when I'm on that stuff<end_line>
"But this is Earth calling, Shady man, come on back!" What?<end_line>
"Man we're losin him, he won't even respond back, fuck!"<end_line>
Now look at all the pretty women in here<end_line>
Dre it's hot, I think we better go check on their temperatures<end_line>
I'll get the thermometer, you get the bandages<end_line>
Now baby just bend over, this won't hurt a damn bit just<end_line>
And give me<end_line>
<verse_end>
