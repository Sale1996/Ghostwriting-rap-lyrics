<verse_start>
I'm the illest rapper to hold a cordless<end_line>
Patrolling corners<end_line>
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters<end_line>
I'm meaner in action<end_line>
Than Rosco beating James Tarteenyer<end_line>
And smackin his back with vacuum cleaner attachments<end_line>
I grew up in the wild hood<end_line>
As a hazardous youth<end_line>
With a fucked up childhood<end_line>
That I used as an excuse<end_line>
And aint shit changed<end_line>
But kept the same mindstate<end_line>
Since the third time that I failed 9th grade<end_line>
You probably think that I'm a negative person don't be so sure of it<end_line>
I don't promote violence I just encourage it<end_line>
I laugh at the sight of death<end_line>
As I fall down a cement flight of steps<end_line>
And land inside a bed of spider webs<end_line>
So throw caution to the wind<end_line>
You and a friend<end_line>
Can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again<end_line>
Shit, why not?  Blow your brain out<end_line>
I'm blowing mine out<end_line>
Fuck it, you only live once you might as well die now<end_line>

<verse_start>
It's only fair to warn<end_line>
I was born with a set of horns<end_line>
And metaphors attached to my damn umbulical cord<end_line>
Warlord of rap little bastard with a two by four board<end_line>
That smashed into your Honda Accord<end_line>
With a 4 door Ford<end_line>
But a more towarddroppin an accapella<end_line>
The choppafella<end_line>
The mozarella<end_line>
Worse than a hellacopta propella<end_line>
Got you locked in the cella<end_line>
With your skeleton showing<end_line>
Developing anorexia<end_line>
While I'm standin next to ya<end_line>
Eating a full course meal watching you starve to death<end_line>
With an IV in your veins<end_line>
Feeding you liquid darvicet<end_line>
Pumping you full of drugs<end_line>
Pull the plugs<end_line>
On the gunshot victims full of bullet slugs<end_line>
Who were picked up in an ambulance<end_line>
And driven<end_line>
To receiving with the asses ripped outta they pants<end_line>
And given<end_line>
A less than 20 percent chance<end_line>
Of living<end_line>
Have a possible placement<end_line>
It's a hospital patient<end_line>
Storing the dead bodies in grandma's little basement<end_line>
Doctor Kevorkian has arrived<end_line>
To perform an autopsy on you while you scream "I'M STILL ALIVE!"<end_line>
Driving a rusty scalpel in through the top of your scalp<end_line>
And pulling your adams apple out through your mouth<end_line>
Better call the fire department<end_line>
I've hired a arson<end_line>
To set fire to carpet<end_line>
And burn up your entire apartment<end_line>
I'm a liar to start shit<end_line>
Got your bitch wrapped around my dick<end_line>
So tight you need a crobar to pry her apart wit<end_line>

<verse_start>
Met a retarded kid named Greg with a wooden leg<end_line>
Snatched it off and beat him over the fucking head with the peg<end_line>
Go to bed with the keg wake up with the 40<end_line>
Mixed up with Alka Seltzer and Formula 44D<end_line>
Fuck an acid tab I'll strap the whole sheet to my forehead<end_line>
Wait until it absorbed in and fell to the floor dead<end_line>
No more said case closed end of discussion<end_line>
I'm blowin up like spontaneous human combustion<end_line>
Leaving you in the aftermath of holocaust and traumas<end_line>
Cross the bombas<end_line>
We blowin up your house killing your parents <end_line>
and coming back to get your foster mommas<end_line>
And I'm as good at keeping a promise as Nostradamus<end_line>
Cause I aint making no more threats<end_line>
I'm doing drivebys in tinted Corvettes on Vietnam war vets<end_line>
I'm more or less sick in the head<end_line>
Maybe more cause I smoked crack<end_line>
today, yesterday, and the day before sabbath<end_line>
Walk the block with a labrador<end_line>
Strapit more corral for war than El Salvador<end_line>
Foul style galore<end_line>
Verbal cow manure<end_line>
Coming together like the eyebrow on Al B. Sure<end_line>
