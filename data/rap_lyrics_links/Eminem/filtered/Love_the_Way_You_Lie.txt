I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like<end_line>
And right now there's a steel knife, in my windpipe<end_line>
I can't breathe but I still fight, while I can fight<end_line>
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight<end_line>
High off her love, drunk from her hate, it's like I'm huffin paint<end_line>
And I love her the more I suffer, I suffocate<end_line>
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates<end_line>
me, she fuckin hates me, and I love it, wait!<end_line>
Where you goin? "I'm leavin you!" No you ain't!<end_line>
Come back, we're runnin right back, here we go a-gain<end_line>
It's so insane, cause when it's goin good it's goin great<end_line>
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane<end_line>
But when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed<end_line>
I snapped, who's that dude? I don't even know his name<end_line>
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again<end_line>
I guess I don't know my own strength<end_line>

You ever love somebody so much, you can barely breathe when you're wit 'em<end_line>
You meet, and neither one of you, even know what hit 'em<end_line>
Got that warm fuzzy feelin, yeah them chills used to get 'em<end_line>
Now you're gettin fuckin sick of lookin at 'em?<end_line>
You swore you'd never hit 'em - never do nothin to hurt 'em<end_line>
Now you're in each other's face spewin venom in your words when you spit 'em<end_line>
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em<end_line>
Throw 'em down, pin 'em, so lost in them moments when you're in 'em<end_line>
It's the rage that took over, it controls ya<end_line>
both, so they say you're best to go your separate ways, guess that they don't know ya<end_line>
Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over<end_line>
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin over<end_line>
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint<end_line>
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game<end_line>
But you lied again; now you get to watch her leave out the window<end_line>
Guess that's why they call it window pane/pain<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Now I know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean<end_line>
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine<end_line>
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me<end_line>
When it comes to love you're just as blinded, baby please<end_line>
come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me<end_line>
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems<end_line>
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano<end_line>
All I know is I love you too much, to walk away though<end_line>
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk<end_line>
Don't you hear sincerity, in my voice when I talk?<end_line>
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball<end_line>
Next time I'm pissed I'll aim my fist, at the drywall<end_line>
Next time, there won't be no next time<end_line>
I apologize even though I know it's lies, I'm tired<end_line>
of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar<end_line>
If she ever tries to fuckin leave again, I'ma tie her<end_line>
to the bed and set this house on fire<end_line>
I'm just gonna<end_line>
<verse_end>
