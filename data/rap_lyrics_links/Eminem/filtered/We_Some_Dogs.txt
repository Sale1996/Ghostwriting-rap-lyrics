Fish don't fry in the kitchen, bitch don't climb, keep bitching<end_line>
Beans don't burn on the grill, 3, 4, 5<end_line>
with the pimping, hoes get your pimps permission<end_line>
Now pay attention, the big D-O double to the G-O<end_line>
to the liquor store to crack a hoe and get some VO<end_line>
And mix it with some pena colidino<end_line>
then slip it on the bitch then I dip with all her c-notes<end_line>
Scandalous, yep bitch cause we know<end_line>
every pretty hoe always down to pull a d-low<end_line>
On me? No, so there wont be no shaking me down, breaking me down, here we go<end_line>
You know I'm just oh so slick<end_line>
the way you chew that bubble gum, the way you sucking a dick<end_line>
And I can tell, that you a freak<end_line>
I wanna stick some dick up in you can I skeet, skeet<end_line>
Don't you know why?<end_line>
