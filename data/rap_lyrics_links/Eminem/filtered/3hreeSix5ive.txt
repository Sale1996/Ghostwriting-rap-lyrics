<verse_start>
I'm tryin to be the illest of the day<end_line>
Three six five a year<end_line>
See that bullshit you sayin, Shady ain't tryin to hear<end_line>
Spittin lyrics in your ear<end_line>
Keepin some up in the chamber<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Some people say I'm strange, I tell them ain't shit change<end_line>
I'm still the same lame asshole with a different name<end_line>
Became late to the last show with a different dane<end_line>
Brain ate from the last ode that I snifed the cane<end_line>
Yo know your spaced the fuck out like George Lucas<end_line>
When your pukus, turnin to yellow with orange mukus<end_line>
So when I grab a pencil and squeeze it between fingers<end_line>
I'm not a rapper, I'm a demon who speaks English<end_line>
Freak genuis, too extreme for the weak and squeemish<end_line>
Burn you alive till you screamin to be extinquished<end_line>
Cause when I drop the science, motherfuckers tell me to stop the violence<end_line>
Start a fire and block the hydrants<end_line>
I'm just a mean person, you never seen worse than<end_line>
So when Slim gets this M-16 burstin<end_line>
You gettin spun backwards like every word of obscene cursin  <end_line>
On the B-side of my first single with the clean version<end_line>
Stoppin your short life when you still a teen virgin<end_line>
Unless you get a kidney speciman from a spleen surgeon<end_line>
In the best hospital possible for emergancy surgery<end_line>
To try to stop the blood from your rushin sternly eternally<end_line>
I'll take it back before we knew each others name<end_line>
Run in a ultrasound and snatch you out your mothers frame<end_line>
I'll take it further back than that<end_line>
Back to lovers lane, to the night you were started <end_line>
Cock block your fathers game <end_line>
I'll plead the fifth like my drawers were muzzled<end_line>
So suck my dick while I take a shit and do this crossword puzzle<end_line>
And when I'm down with ten seconds left, then to hope out<end_line>
I'ma throw a head-but so hard, I'll knock us both out<end_line>
<verse_end>
