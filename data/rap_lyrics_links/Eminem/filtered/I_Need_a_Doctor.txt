I told the world, one day I would pay it back<end_line>
Say it on tape and lay it, record it so that one day I could play it back<end_line>
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin that<end_line>
Doubt's startin to creep in, every day is just so gray and black<end_line>
Hope, I just need a ray of that<end_line>
Cause no one sees my vision when I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack<end_line>
But they don't know what dope is<end_line>
and I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this<end_line>
All I know is, you came to me when I was at my lowest!<end_line>
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you<end_line>
But for the life of me I don't see why you don't see like I do<end_line>
But it just dawned on me you lost a son, demons fightin you<end_line>
It's dark, let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you<end_line>
I don't think you realize what you mean to me, not the slightest clue<end_line>
Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick, you<end_line>
gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fuckin mic or you<end_line>
gon' hug me but I'm out of options, there's nothin else I can do<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas<end_line>
You say they're just pieces so I'm puzzled, cause the shit I hear<end_line>
is crazy but you're either gettin lazy or you don't believe in you no more<end_line>
Seems like your own opinion's not one you can form<end_line>
Can't make a decision, you keep questionin yourself<end_line>
Second guessin and it's almost like you're beggin for my help<end_line>
Like I'm your leader, you're supposed to fuckin be my mentor<end_line>
I can endure, no more; I demand you remember who you are!<end_line>
It was YOU, who believed in me, when EVERYONE was tellin you<end_line>
don't sign me, everyone at the fuckin label, let's tell the TRUTH!<end_line>
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you<end_line>
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy, Dre I'm cryin in this booth!<end_line>
You saved my life, now maybe it's my turn to save yours<end_line>
But I could never repay you, what you did for me is way more<end_line>
But I ain't givin up faith, and you ain't givin up on me, GET UP DRE!<end_line>
I'm dyin, I need you! Come back for fuck's sake!<end_line>
<verse_end>
