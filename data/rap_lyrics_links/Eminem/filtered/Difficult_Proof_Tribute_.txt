<verse_start>
They ask me am I okay, they ask me if I'm happy<end_line>
Are they askin me that because of the shit that's been thrown at me?<end_line>
Or am I just a little snappy and they genuinely care?<end_line>
Doody, most of my life it's just been me and you there<end_line>
And I continuously stare at pictures of you<end_line>
I never got to say "I love you" as much as I wanted to but I do<end_line>
Yeah, I say it now and you can't hear me<end_line>
What the fuck good does that do me now? But somehow I know you're near me<end_line>
Your presence; oh I went and dropped some presents off for Easter<end_line>
to them, two little beautiful boys of yours to try to ease their<end_line>
minds a little and dawg you'll never believe this<end_line>
But Sharonda, actually talks to me now, Jesus!<end_line>
And everyone else is just tryin to pick up the pieces<end_line>
Man how could you touch so many fuckin lives and just leave us?<end_line>
They say grievance has its way of affectin everyone different<end_line>
If it's, true, how the fuck I'm 'sposed to get over you?<end_line>
Difficult as it sounds...<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Yo, yeah<end_line>
Doody - that's what we called each other<end_line>
I don't know where it came from but it just stuck with us, we was always brothers<end_line>
Never thought about each other's, skin colors<end_line>
'Til one day we was walkin up the block in the summer<end_line>
It was like 90 degrees, I was catchin a sunburn<end_line>
Tryin to walk under the trees just to get me some comfort<end_line>
I'm moanin, I just wanna get home and I look over<end_line>
and your shirt is off, I'm like "You're gonna fry"; you're like, "No I won't I'm<end_line>
Black stupid! And Black people they got melatonin<end_line>
in their skin, we don't burn!" Meanwhile my face is glowin<end_line>
And I feel like I'm on fire, and the entire time you're just laughin at me<end_line>
And snappin at me with your shirt bastard<end_line>
And I have to get you back for that shit<end_line>
And by the way them playboy rings my mother stole from you<end_line>
Well Nate finally got 'em back, shit<end_line>
That musta been at least 16 years ago, well I put 'em in your cask-oww<end_line>
Movin past it, it still ain't registered yet<end_line>
But you can bet, your legacy they'll never forget<end_line>
The Motor City Motown, hip-hop vet<end_line>
Hip Hop Shop dreads, it don't stop there<end_line>
Yeah, as difficult as it sounds...<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Yeah, and this may sound a little strange but I'ma tell it<end_line>
I found a jacket that you left at my wedding, I picked it to smell it<end_line>
I wrapped it up in plastic until I put it in glass and<end_line>
hang it up in the hallway so I can always look at it<end_line>
And as for all of me and D12, we feel like "Fuck rap"<end_line>
It feels like our general just fuckin died in our lap<end_line>
We shut off all our pagers, all our cell numbers is changed, our two-ways<end_line>
are in the trash so some cats'll have to find a new way<end_line>
And I know that it feels like the dreams will die with you today<end_line>
But the truth is they're all still here, and you ain't<end_line>
Purple Gang, you gotta keep pressin on<end_line>
Don't ever give up the dream dawg, I got love for you all<end_line>
And Doody, it's true you brought people together <end_line>
who never woulda been in the same room if it wasn't for you<end_line>
You were the peace-maker Doody, I know sometimes you were moody<end_line>
But you hated confrontation and truly hated the feuding<end_line>
But you was down for yours whenever it came to scrappin<end_line>
If it had to happen it had to happen - believe me<end_line>
I know you're the one who taught me to throw dem 'bows back on Dresden<end_line>
From eggin cars to paintballin, gettin arrested<end_line>
to sittin across from each other in cells laughin and jestin<end_line>
They tried to hit us for five years for that, no question<end_line>
I guess them hookers and bums that we shot up didn't show up for court<end_line>
so we got off on a technicality, left sweatin<end_line>
Me, you and - what's his face? I forgot his fuckin name<end_line>
Shame he even came to your funeral, he betrayed <end_line>
our team and if I see him again I'ma punch him in the fuckin face<end_line>
and that's on Hailie Jade, Whitney Lane, and Alaina's name<end_line>
I'll let the pistol bang once just to lick a shot<end_line>
in the air for you and pour some liquor out<end_line>
with Obie in the parkin lot, of 54 just before<end_line>
we were supposed to get in cars to come and see you once more<end_line>
Difficult as it sounds...<end_line>
