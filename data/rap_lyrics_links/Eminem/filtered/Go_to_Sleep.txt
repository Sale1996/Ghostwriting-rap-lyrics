I ain't gonna eat, I ain't gonna sleep<end_line>
Ain't gonna breathe, 'til I see what I wanna see<end_line>
And what I wanna see, is you go to sleep in the dirt<end_line>
Permanently, you just bein hurt, this ain't gonna work<end_line>
For me, it just wouldn't be, sufficient enough<end_line>
Cause we, are just gonna be, enemies<end_line>
As long as we breathe, I don't ever see, either of us<end_line>
Comin to terms, where we can agree<end_line>
There ain't gonna be, no reasonin, speakin wit me<end_line>
You speak on my seed, then me, no speak-a ingles<end_line>
So we gonna beef, and keep on beefin, unless<end_line>
You're gonna agree, to meet with me in the flesh<end_line>
And settle this face to face, and you're gonna see<end_line>
A demon unleashed in me, that you've never seen<end_line>
And you're gonna see, this gangster pee on himself<end_line>
I see you D-12, and thanks, but me need no help<end_line>
Me do this one all by my lonely<end_line>
I don't need fifteen of my homies<end_line>
When I see you, I'm seein you, me and you only<end_line>
We never met, but best believe you gon' know me<end_line>
When I'm this close, to see you exposed as phony<end_line>
Come on bitch, show me, pick me up, throw me<end_line>
Lift me up, hold me, just like you told me<end_line>
You was gonna do, that's what I thought, you're pitiful<end_line>
