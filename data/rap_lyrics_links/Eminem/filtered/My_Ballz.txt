Football, Football, I love football<end_line>
Yes, tres, dos, uno<end_line>
Dos, tres, fuck, shit, bitch, asshole son of a bitch<end_line>
Everybody cuddle, blah I mean huddle<end_line>
I just stepped in a mud puddle, butthole<end_line>
Freak, who just tapped on my ass cheek<end_line>
Nevermind, let's try quarterback sneak<end_line>
Cover me, smother me with love that's brotherly<end_line>
That didn't work, try another play<end_line>
Hut one, hut two, hut hut hurry up<end_line>
I'm reachin' up another grown man's butt<end_line>
Hike the ball, I mean I like Bizarre<end_line>
But Jesus, he hikes, I think I can feel his balls<end_line>
My dick is long as it is hard, yeah so are my balls<end_line>
It's the longest yard, whoops that's not the chorus<end_line>
Run it back, wrong song, yeah disreguard<end_line>
That whole statement I just made, what yard line we on?<end_line>
Our own 5 and our timeouts are gone<end_line>
Less than a minute left, I just throw my ball<end_line>
To the sideline to Von, he steps outta bounds<end_line>
48 seconds left on the clock but every last one counts<end_line>
Call another huddle, we're down by six<end_line>
The plan is, to throw the ball to Swift<end_line>
But he's so god dang high, that he's trips<end_line>
Falls and slips, Proof grabs him by his fingertips<end_line>
And runs the ball all the way down to the one<end_line>
But he don't get in, but all we need is a put ???<end_line>
But all we need is a touch down and an extra point to win<end_line>
But then I get sacked all the way back to the ten<end_line>
God dammit I'ma slap somebody if I get tapped on the ass again<end_line>
Everybody's laughin' now, no timeouts and its now fourth now<end_line>
We're never gonna make it, wait I just got an idea<end_line>
Quick, everybody get naked, Denaun go long<end_line>
I'ma throw the bomb, c'mon how they gonna tackle you with no pants on<end_line>
Ass out with a floppin' schlong, touchdown yeah I told you<end_line>
It's the longest yard<end_line>
