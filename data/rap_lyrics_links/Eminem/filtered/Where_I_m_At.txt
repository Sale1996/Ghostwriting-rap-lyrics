<verse_start>
History is like a point of no delay<end_line>
Keeps repeatin itself, what else can I say?<end_line>
You wonderin why I act this way<end_line>
I never should've gave you the time of day<end_line>
Guess you know what time it is now, ay?<end_line>
There must've been a gust of wind<end_line>
Cause you change your mind every time it blows and you just changed it a-muh'fuckin-gain<end_line>
You just said you just wanted some dick, 'fore I stuck it in<end_line>
I wouldn't have been such a prick to you, fuckin men<end_line>
You say you don't trust 'em<end_line>
Why do I hear the sound of toilets flushin? Some shit is goin down<end_line>
You must've just not have been truthful from the start<end_line>
See for me it'd be nothin to say you never had my heart but I'd be lyin<end_line>
Fuckin see why they call this bullshit a relationship, ships sink<end_line>
And you know it's love as soon as you fall in it cause shit stinks<end_line>
And it feels like every time I fuckin do, I get jinxed<end_line>
Cupid must've put a curse on me, six weeks<end_line>
have went by, and we only spoke twice<end_line>
I'm sittin in your driveway callin you from the car, suffice<end_line>
I think it's safe to say you're not at home<end_line>
I'm callin your cell phone you answer but I can tell though, that you're not alone<end_line>
How was I to know?<end_line>
It should've been time to go a long time ago; I kept holdin on<end_line>
It's comical when I think back now, why I couldn't get the hint<end_line>
You feel the draft you were thrown, I wasn't catchin your drift<end_line>
But there's a cold breeze blowin over me, I'm over you<end_line>
Success is the best revenge to pay you back, and that payment is overdue<end_line>
I overcame odds to get even<end_line>
The sober me is shittin all over the un-sober you<end_line>
And I hope they play this at every club that you're goin to<end_line>
I'm hauntin you bitch, everywhere you turn I'm followin you<end_line>
Cause I loved you with every ounce of me, you know it's true<end_line>
It's killin you now, yeah I hope the hoe dies slow in you<end_line>
It's cause of you now I don't trust 'em at all, fuck 'em<end_line>
Middle finger up, I'ma just keep grabbin my balls, cup 'em<end_line>
I never fall again, I trip on stairs, I fall up 'em<end_line>
So buttercup don't try to come back knockin on my door all dolled up<end_line>
Cause I'm movin on, don't worry about me<end_line>
Cause I'ma be just fine without you, you'll see<end_line>
There ain't no one on this Earth right now I'd much rather be<end_line>
Cause God damnit I'm glad that I'm me<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I said if you could be where I'm at<end_line>
