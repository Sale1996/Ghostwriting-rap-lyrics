Yes man<end_line>
As the World Turns<end_line>
We all experience things in life<end_line>
Trials and Tribulations<end_line>
That we all must go through<end_line>
When someone wants to test us<end_line>
When someone tries our patience<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I hang with a bunch of hippies<end_line>
and wacky tobacco planters<end_line>
Who swallow lit roaches<end_line>
and light up like jack-o-lanterns<end_line>
Outsiders baby, and we suing the courts<end_line>
Cuz we're dope as fuck and only get a 2 in the source<end_line>
They never should've booted me out of reform school<end_line>
Deformed fool,takin a shit in a warm pool<end_line>
They threw me out the Ramada Inn<end_line>
I said it wasn't me, I got a twin<end_line>
It all started when my mother took my bike away<end_line>
Cuz I murdered my guinea pig and stuck him in the microwave<end_line>
After that, It was straight to the 40 ouncers<end_line>
Slappin teachers, and jackin off in front of my counselors<end_line>
Class clown freshman, dressed like Les Nessman<end_line>
Fuck the next lesson, I'll past the test guessin<end_line>
And all the other kids said Eminem's a dishead,<end_line>
He'll never last, the only class he'll pass is phys ed<end_line>
May be true, till I told this bitch in gym class<end_line>
That she was too fat to swim laps, she needed Slim Fast<end_line>
Yeah bitch you so big you walked into big Tanny's and stepped on Jenny Craig<end_line>
She picked me up to snap me like a skinny twig<end_line>
Put me in the headlock, then I thought of my guinea pig<end_line>
I felt the evilness and started transformin<end_line>
It began storming, I heard a bunch of cheering fans swarming<end_line>
Grabbed that bitch by her hair<end_line>
Drug her across the ground<end_line>
And took her up to the highest diving board and tossed her down<end_line>
Sorry coach, its too late to tell me stop<end_line>
While I drop this bitch face down and watch her belly flop<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
We drive around in million dollar sports cars<end_line>
While little kids hide this tape from their parents like bad report cards<end_line>
Outsiders, and we suing the courts<end_line>
Cuz we dope as fuck and only get a 2 in The Source<end_line>
Hypercondriac, hanging out at the laundromat<end_line>
Where all the raunchy fat white trashy blondes be at<end_line>
Dressed like a sailor, standin by a pale of garbage<end_line>
Its almost dark and I'm still tryna nail a trailor park bitch<end_line>
I met a slut and said "What up, its nice to meet ya"<end_line>
I'd like to treat ya to a Faygo and a slice of pizza<end_line>
But I'm broke as fuck and I don't get paid till the first of next month<end_line>
But if you care to join me, I was bout to roll this next blunt<end_line>
But I aint got no weed, no phillies, or no papers<end_line>
Plus I'm a rapist and a repeated prison escapist<end_line>
So gimme all your money<end_line>
And don't try nothin funny<end_line>
Cuz you know your stinkin ass is too fat to try to outrun me<end_line>
I went to grab my gun<end_line>
Thats when her ass put it on me<end_line>
Wit an uppercut and hit me with a basket of laundry<end_line>
I fell through the glass doors<end_line>
Started causin a scene<end_line>
Then slid across the floor and flew right into a washin machine<end_line>
Jumped up with a broken back<end_line>
Thank god I was smokin crack all day<end_line>
And doped up off coke and smack<end_line>
All I wanted to do was rape the bitch and snatch her purse<end_line>
Now I wanna kill her<end_line>
But so I gotta catch her first<end_line>
Ran through Rally's parkin lot and took a shortcut<end_line>
Saw the house she ran up in<end_line>
And shot her fuckin porch up<end_line>
Kicked the door down to murder this divorced slut<end_line>
Looked around the room<end_line>
Thats when I seen the bedroom door shut<end_line>
I know you're in there bitch! I got my gun cocked!<end_line>
You might as well come out now<end_line>
She said "Come in, its unlocked!"<end_line>
I walked in and all I smelled was Liz Claiborne<end_line>
And seen her spread across the bed naked watchin gay porn<end_line>
She said "Come her big boy, lets get acquainted"<end_line>
I turned around to run, twisted my ankle and sprained it<end_line>
She came at me at full speed, nothin could stop her<end_line>
I shot her five times and every bullet bounced off her<end_line>
I started to beg "No, please let go"<end_line>
But she swallowed my fuckin leg whole like an egg roll<end_line>
With one leg left, now I'm hoppin around crippled<end_line>
I grabbed my pocket knife and sliced off her right nipple<end_line>
Just trying to buy me some time, then I remembered this magic trick<end_line>
Den Den Den Den Den Den, Go go gadget dick!<end_line>
Whipped that shit out, and aint no doubt about it<end_line>
It hit the ground and caused an earthquake and power outage<end_line>
I shouted "Now bitch, lets see who gets the best!"<end_line>
Stuffed that shit in crooked and fucked that fat slut to death<end_line>
Come here bitch!<end_line>
Come here!<end_line>
Take this motherfuckin dick!<end_line>
Bitch, come here!<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
And as we go along<end_line>
Throughout the days of our lives<end_line>
We all face small obstacles and challenges everyday<end_line>
That we must go through<end_line>
These are the things that surround us through our atmosphere<end_line>
Every day<end_line>
Every single day the world keeps turning<end_line>
