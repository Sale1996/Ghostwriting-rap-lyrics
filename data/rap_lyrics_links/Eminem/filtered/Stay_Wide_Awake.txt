Fe-fi-fo-fum, I think I smell the scent of a placenta<end_line>
I enter Central Park, it's dark, it's winter in December<end_line>
I see my target, put my car in park and approach her tender<end_line>
Young girl by the name of Brenda and I pretend to befriend her<end_line>
Sit down beside her like a spider; hi there girl, you mighta<end_line>

-ssault and rape and figure why not try not to make your pussy wider<end_line>
Fuck you with an umbrella then open it up while the shit's inside ya<end_line>
I'm the kinda guy that's mild but I might flip and get a little bit wilder<end_line>
Impregnate a lesbian, yeah now let's see her have triplets and I'll di-<end_line>
-sintegrate them babies as soon as they're out her with formalde-<end_line>
-hyde and cyanide, girl you can try and hide, you can try to scream louder<end_line>
No need for no gunpowder, that only takes all the fun outta<end_line>

So dark and so cold, my friends don't know this other side of me<end_line>
There's a monster inside of me, it's quite ugly and it fright-ens me<end_line>
But they can't see what I can see, there's a vacancy in my tummy<end_line>
It's makin me play hide-and-seek, like Jason I'm so hungry<end_line>
She's naked see, no privacy but I can see she wants me<end_line>
So patient, see I try to be but gee, why does she taunt me?<end_line>
Pulls the drapes and she goes right to sleep and I creep right through the front see<end_line>
So blatantly but silently cause I know that she's sound sleep<end_line>
"Who's wakin me so violently and why's he on top of me?<end_line>
He's rapin me," she tries to scream, "Somebody please get him off me<end_line>
He's tapin me, he's bitin me, he's laughing like it's funny"<end_line>
She's scrapin me, she's fightin me, she's scratchin like some dumb freak<end_line>
Escapin me, no dice you see, I might just be Ted Bundy<end_line>
or Satan, gee what a sight to see, I'm dancing in my red panties<end_line>
I'm crazy but it's all right with me, man life can be so empty<end_line>
Stay away from me cause I'm dancing to quite a different drumbeat<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Better try to stay wide awake or you might end up found dead by the lake<end_line>
Soon as you lay me down to sleep it's your soul I'ma try to take<end_line>
Pray for light of day right away, why do they try to fight today?<end_line>
I must make them pay twice as much, might as well put the knife away<end_line>
Now I use power tools, how 'bout now, are you in the shower?<end_line>
Scour you for six hours 'til outage of power outlets<end_line>
How did you figure out I was down in your basement, now ya<end_line>
must've just heard the sound of my stomach growlin from down there<end_line>
Prowler, there's no one fouler; bound ya, that's how they found ya<end_line>
Face down in the tub I drown ya with piles of downers around ya<end_line>
Such nostalgia and power, such prowess, look how ya cower<end_line>
Jump out on you now like I was Jawa from fuckin Star Wars<end_line>
Jabba the Hutt, beddy-bye-bye, beddy-bye-bye, it's time to die-die<end_line>
Oughta not even bother to scream, it don't even matter<end_line>
Amazing when grazing skin with these razor blades he waves at ya<end_line>
Not ya everyday Damien, bathe me in holy water<end_line>
Nothing like Son of Sam so please understand there's no gun in hand<end_line>
Where's the thrill in the hunt, there's no fun in that, here I come with axe<end_line>
Fun to act like lumberjack when I'm hackin 'em up with that<end_line>
What was that? Dial 9-1-1, someone's comin in from the back<end_line>
