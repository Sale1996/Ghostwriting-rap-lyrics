<verse_start>
Ever since I was introduced to rap music<end_line>
I been missin a screw like Bishop in "Juice," I could lose it<end_line>
at any moment, those who know me know it<end_line>
So they probably told to go with the flow, just so that<end_line>
I don't explode and, have another episode<end_line>
where I let it go as far as the one with Benzino did<end_line>
I'm waitin for that next beef, I'm cocked locked and loaded<end_line>
I'm ready to go so bad<end_line>
I'm goin bananas, my dick's so hard Anna Nicole could<end_line>
use it to fuckin pole-vault with<end_line>
Oh shit!  I mean when she was still bloated<end_line>
before they cut her stomach open and lypo'ed it<end_line>
Anybody I throw flames at, gets a name<end_line>
It's a game, cause they know that they don't spit the same<end_line>
It's a shame, what people do for ten minutes of fame<end_line>
Everyday it's the same thing<end_line>
People in this game try to buddy-buddy us<end_line>
Just to get close enough to study us<end_line>
Everybody just wants to have somethin to do with that<end_line>
They all tryna get that stamp<end_line>
They after that Shady/Aftermath money<end_line>
It's like a monopoly<end_line>
They probably just now finally understand "How to Rob" fully<end_line>
50 Cent was like a fuckin jackpot for me<end_line>
And Dre, it's like we hit the fuckin lottery<end_line>
and the damn slot machine at the same time as each other<end_line>
Why the fuck you think we ride like we brothers?<end_line>
When we rhyme with each other, in time we discovered<end_line>
that we had more in common that we thought with each other<end_line>
Both robbed of our mothers, our fathers ain't want us<end_line>
What was wrong with us, was it our fault?<end_line>
Cause we started thinkin God doesn't love us<end_line>
Two odd motherfuckers who just happened to meet at the right time<end_line>
What a coincidence it is, cause when 50 got shot up in Jamaica<end_line>
Queens, I still remember the call up at Chung King cause<end_line>
Big L had just got popped just a month before<end_line>
If 50 lives he's gettin dropped from Columbia<end_line>
Two years later me and Doc had to come and uhh<end_line>
Operate, that's when he popped up at number one<end_line>
And we ain't never gonna stop if you wonderin<end_line>
Even if I'm under the gun<end_line>
You ain't got to agree all the time with me or see eye to eye<end_line>
There'll always be animosity between you and I<end_line>
But see the difference is, if it is, I could give a shit<end_line>
Still gonna conduct motherfuckin business as usual<end_line>
Egos aside 'fore I bruise 'em all<end_line>
Swallow your pride 'fore I step on it with shoes you call<end_line>
Nikes, Earthlings, how do you like these?<end_line>
You gotta love 'em, look at the bottom of 'em, they're like cleats<end_line>
Stompin, I been rompin<end_line>
since Tim Dog was, hollerin, "Fuck Compton"<end_line>
I was whylin, freestylin<end_line>
Back when, they were still makin, Maxell casettes<end_line>
It wasn't even rap sell us yet, that tells us that<end_line>
any doubts in your head that seals the shit<end_line>
Ricky ticky toc, ticky ticky toc<end_line>
Still with the Diggy Diggy Doc, Diggy Diggy Doc<end_line>
And ya don't stop... <end_line>
