I get lifted and spin til I'm half-twisted<end_line>
Feet planted and stand with a grin full of chapped lipstick<end_line>
Pen full of ink, think sinful and rap sick shit<end_line>
Shrink pencil me in for my last visit<end_line>
Drink gin til my chin's full of splashed whiskers<end_line>
Hash whiskey and ash til I slap bitches<end_line>
Ask Bizzy, he's been here the past six years<end_line>

That's why the city is filled with a bunch of fuckin idiots still<end_line>
That's why the first motherfucker poppin some shit he gets killed<end_line>
That's why we don't call it Detroit, we call it Amityville<end_line>
You can get capped after just havin a cavity filled<end_line>

Plus some registration that just made this shit valid this year?<end_line>
Cause once I snap I can't be held accountable for my actions<end_line>
