Hi there little boys and girls<end_line>
Today we're gonna to learn how to poison squirrels<end_line>
But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob<end_line>
Say hi Bob!Bob's 30 and still lives with his mom<end_line>
and he don't got a job, cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot<end_line>
but his twelve-year old brother looks up to him an awful lot<end_line>
And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot<end_line>
and wait in the parkin lot for waitresses off the clock<end_line>
when it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog<end_line>
Drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks<end_line>
And even if they escaped and they got the cops<end_line>
the ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge<end_line>
'til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job<end_line>
when she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk<end_line>
But Stacey knew it was Bob and said knock it off<end_line>
But Bob wouldn't knock it off cause he's crazy and off his rocker<end_line>
Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka<end_line>
You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a "Dr."<end_line>
He grabbed Stace' by the legs as chopped it off her<end_line>
and dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her<end_line>
But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander<end_line>
they never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner<end_line>
And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana, <end_line>
and what it might do to you<end_line>
So see if the squirrels want any - it's bad for you <end_line>

My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it? <end_line>
FUCK NO you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut<end_line>
Speakin of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels?<end_line>
Ecstasy is the worst drug in the world<end_line>
If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it<end_line>
Kids two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid<end_line>
and spinal fluid is final, you won't get it back<end_line>
So don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in your back<end_line>
Meet Zach, twenty-one years old <end_line>
After hangin out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold<end_line>
and decides to try five, when he's bribed by five guys<end_line>
and peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it<end_line>
Suddenly, he starts to convulse and his pulse goes into hyperdrive<end_line>
and his eyes roll back in his skull<end_line>
His back starts tah - look like the McDonald's Arches<end_line>
He's on Donald's carpet, layin horizontal barfin<end_line>
And everyone in the apartment starts laughin at him<end_line>
"Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!"<end_line>
cause they took it too, so they think it's funny<end_line>
So they're laughing at basically nothing except maybe wasting his money<end_line>
Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over<end_line>
and his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin yoga<end_line>
And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac<end_line>
So don't even feed that to squirrels class, cause it's bad for you<end_line>

And last but not least, one of the most humungous<end_line>
problems among young people today, is fungus<end_line>
It grows from cow manure, they pick it out, wipe it off, <end_line>
bag it up, and you put it right in your mouth and chew it<end_line>
Yum yum!  Then you start to see some dumb stuff<end_line>
And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em..<end_line>
And sometimes you see things that aren't there<end_line>
Like fat woman in G-strings with orange hair<end_line>
 It's yarn Claire<end_line>
Women stick 'em up their behinds, go out and wear 'em<end_line>
And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms<end_line>
Whoops, did I say magic mushrooms?  I meant fungus<end_line>
Ya tongue gets, all swoll up like a cow's tongue<end_line>
cause it comes from a cow's dung<end_line>
See drugs are bad, it's a common fact<end_line>
But your mom and dad, know that's all that I'm good at<end_line>
But don't be me, cause if you grow up and you go and O.D.<end_line>
They're gonna come for me and I'ma have to grow a goatee<end_line>
and get a disguise and hide, cause it'll be my fault<end_line>
So don't do drugs, and do exactly as I don't, <end_line>
cause I'm bad for you<end_line>
<verse_end>
