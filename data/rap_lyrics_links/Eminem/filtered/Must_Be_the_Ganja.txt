Ok here we go, Do-re-mi-fa-so-fa-so-la-ti so<end_line>
Lyrical rascal, kick back the tobasco<end_line>
You motherfucker's must just not know the tic-tac-so<end_line>
Time to show you the most kickass flow in the cosmos<end_line>
Picasso with a pickaxe, a sick asshole<end_line>
Tic-tac-toe comes with sixpack, with exact doe<end_line>
Knives, strangling wives with dick-lasso<end_line>
3 bags of the grass, Zig Zags, I'm with the Doc so<end_line>
You know how that go, skull and the crossbones<end_line>
This is poison to poison girls who do not know<end_line>
You do not wanna try this at home my lil vato<end_line>
This is neither the time nor the place to get macho<end_line>
So crack a six pack, sit back with some nachos<end_line>
Maybe some popcorn, watch the show and just rock slow<end_line>
It's not what you expected, not what you thought so<end_line>
Bout time you wake the fuck up, smell the pot smoke<end_line>

Your dreams are getting fulfilled, Ooh I'm literally getting a chill<end_line>
Spitting at will, me and Dre have just finished splitting a pill<end_line>
You're submitting to skill, sitting still<end_line>
I'm admitting I'm beginning to feel like I don't think anyone's real<end_line>
Faced with a dilemma, I can be Dalai Lama<end_line>
And be calmer, bring drama a step beyond a Jeffrey Dahmer<end_line>
Please don't upset me mama, you're looking sexy mama<end_line>
Don't know if it's the lala, or the rum and Pepsi mama<end_line>
Don't wanna end up inside my refrigerator freezer<end_line>
Be used as extra topping, then next time I make a pizza<end_line>
How many people you know that can name every serial killer<end_line>
Who ever existed in a row, put them in chronological order<end_line>
Beginning with Jack the Ripper<end_line>
Name the time and place from the body, the bag, the zipper<end_line>
Location of the woods where the body was dragged and then dumped<end_line>
The trunk that they was stuffed in, the model, the make, the plate<end_line>
And which model, which state they found her and how they attacked the victim<end_line>
Say what murder weapon was used to do what on which one<end_line>
Which knife and which gun, what kid, what wife and which nun<end_line>
Don't stop, I like this it's fun, the fucking night's just begun<end_line>

When I'm behind the mic, dynamite's what it's kinda like<end_line>
You're stuck with the same stick that you're trying to light<end_line>
Behind the boards, it's Dre, legends are made this way<end_line>
Isn't it safe to say, this is the way it should be?<end_line>
Maybe you need some lyric syrup serum for your symptoms<end_line>
Here's a dosage of the antidote, now you give him some<end_line>
He can give her some, she can give them some<end_line>
Get behind a lint drum, make up a beat and kill the sucker syndrome<end_line>
The spinning drum when it comes to lyrics and penning some<end_line>
Starting from scratch and then ending up at the ending of<end_line>
Capable of winning her, bullets are, so unbelievable its a<end_line>
Titanium cranium that's full of surprises<end_line>
When the smoke rises, right before your very own eyes<end_line>
You stare into your stereos<end_line>
Good evening, this isn't even a weed thing<end_line>
I ain't even smoke anything, I ain't even drinking<end_line>
