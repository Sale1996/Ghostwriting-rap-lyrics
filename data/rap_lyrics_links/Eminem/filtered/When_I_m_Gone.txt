Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?<end_line>
Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for?<end_line>
When they know they're your heart<end_line>
And you know you were their armour<end_line>
And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm 'em<end_line>
But what happens when karma, turns right around and bites you?<end_line>
And everything you stand for, turns on you, despite you?<end_line>
What happens when you become the main source of a pain?<end_line>
"Daddy look what I made", Dad's gotta go catch a plane<end_line>
"Daddy where's Mommy? I can't find Mommy where is she?"<end_line>
I don't know go play Hailie, baby, your Daddy's busy<end_line>
Daddy's writing this song, this song ain't gonna write itself<end_line>
I'll give you one underdog then you gotta swing by yourself<end_line>
Then turn right around on that song and tell her you love her<end_line>
And put hands on her mother, who's a spitting image of her<end_line>
That's Slim Shady, yeah baby, Slim Shady's crazy<end_line>
Shady made me, but tonight Shady's rocka-by-baby...<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I keep having this dream, I'm pushin' Hailie on the swing<end_line>
She keeps screaming, she don't want me to sing<end_line>
"You're making Mommy cry, why? Why is Mommy crying?"<end_line>
Baby, Daddy ain't leaving no more, "Daddy you're lying<end_line>
"You always say that, you always say this is the last time<end_line>
"But you ain't leaving no more, Daddy you're mine"<end_line>
She's piling boxes in front of the door trying to block it<end_line>
"Daddy please, Daddy don't leave, Daddy - no stop it!"<end_line>
Goes in her pocket, pulls out a tiny necklace locket<end_line>
It's got a picture, "this'll keep you safe Daddy, take it withcha'"<end_line>
I look up, it's just me standing in the mirror<end_line>
These stinkin' walls must be talking, cause man I can hear 'em<end_line>
They're saying "You've got one more chance to do right" - and it's tonight<end_line>
Now go out there and show that you love 'em before it's too late<end_line>
And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door<end_line>
It's turns to a stage, they're gone, and this spotlight is on<end_line>
And I'm singing...<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Sixty thousand people, all jumping out their seat<end_line>
The curtain closes, they're throwing roses at my feet<end_line>
I take a bow and thank you all for coming out<end_line>
They're screaming so loud, I take one last look at the crowd<end_line>
I glance down, I don't believe what I'm seeing<end_line>
"Daddy it's me, help Mommy, her wrists are bleeding"<end_line>
But baby we're in Sweden, how did you get to Sweden?<end_line>
"I followed you Daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'<end_line>
"You lied to me Dad, and now you make Mommy sad<end_line>
"And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'<end_line>
"That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin"<end_line>
"I get the point - fine, me and Mommy are gone"<end_line>
But baby wait, "it's too late Dad, you made the choice<end_line>
"Now go up there and show 'em that you love 'em more than us"<end_line>
That's what they want, they want you Marshall, they keep.. screamin' your name<end_line>
It's no wonder you can't go to sleep, just take another pill<end_line>
Yeah, I bet you you will. You rap about it, yeah, word, k-keep it real<end_line>
I hear applause, all this time I couldn't see<end_line>
How could it be, that the curtain is closing on me<end_line>
I turn around, find a gun on the ground, cock it<end_line>
Put it to my brain and scream "Die Shady" and pump it<end_line>
The sky darkens, my life flashes, the plane that I was<end_line>
supposed to be on crashes and burns to ashes<end_line>
That's when I wake up, alarm clock's ringin', there's birds singin'<end_line>
It's Spring and Hailie's outside swinging, I walk up to Kim and kiss her<end_line>
Tell her I miss her, Hailie just smiles and winks at her little sister<end_line>
Almost as if to say..<end_line>
