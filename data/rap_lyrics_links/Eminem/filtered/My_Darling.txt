If I would've rap about the crap that's out, that's the route<end_line>
you probably want me to take cause you're just dyin to know what I think<end_line>
Here my take on some other rappers<end_line>
If I was to say somethin about Paul Wall you'd probably crap in your pants<end_line>
Cause I'm white and he's white, so he's like<end_line>
my competition I mean, right? Nope<end_line>
Paul Wall is dope, and so is Bubba, so<end_line>
B-b-b-b-b-b, but<end_line>
I don't compete with nobody<end_line>
I just go hard, do the rope-a-dope Ali shuffle<end_line>
And dance around my opponents, do donuts<end_line>
Sometimes I play possum, like I'm asleep it's awesome<end_line>
I'm like a sleepin giant and when I awake I'm like Dre<end_line>
I just jump from outta nowhere and bite break<end_line>
And sink my teeth in 'em and fill 'em, full of poison<end_line>
And make a noise like a snake before I kill 'em<end_line>
And let 'em know that I just don't feel 'em<end_line>
And smack 'em with the backwards E on the Eminem emblem<end_line>
I was taught if you gonna murder somebody you should face 'em<end_line>
Tell 'em why, look 'em dead in the eye, then waste 'em<end_line>
And the dark shall emerge from the fiery depths of hell<end_line>
Then swallow the shell, all the hollow who dwell<end_line>
in the shadows of all who are willing to sell their souls<end_line>
For this rap game and it gg-goes<end_line>
One-two-three, chk-chk one-two-three<end_line>
Chk-chk one-two-three, that ain't the hook, now follow me<end_line>
There's nothing else for me to say, my public adores me<end_line>
Everybody bores me, they're just so corny<end_line>
So at night before I sleep, I look in the mirror<end_line>
The mirror grows lips and it whispers "Come nearer"<end_line>

 Let me guide you) FUCK YOU, DIE YOU<end_line>
SON-OF-A-BITCH!Bye-bye!<end_line>
Okay, I'm still alive (so am I too!<end_line>
 You can't kill a spirit even if you tried to<end_line>
 Ha ha, you sold your soul to me, need I remind you?<end_line>
 You remember that night you<end_line>
 prayed to God you'd give anything to get a record deal, well Dre signed you<end_line>
 This is what you wanted your whole life Marshall, right? Ooh<end_line>
 Look at this house, look at these cars, they're so nice, woo!<end_line>
 Oh, but you didn't know fame has a price to?<end_line>
 That you just now seein the downside too?<end_line>
 Lose your best friend from high school, your wife too<end_line>
 Ain't even sure if your kids like you?<end_line>
 Come off tour, can't even sleep at night without NyQuil<end_line>
 Think I'm a Valium addict, start a rehab cycle<end_line>
 But together we can break the cycle<end_line>
 Marshall) WHAT?!<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I said I don't ever want you to leave, you're my darling<end_line>
You and me were meant to be together my darling<end_line>
And if I cannot have you no one can, you're my darling<end_line>
Cause I possess your soul, your mind, your heart and your body<end_line>
<verse_end>
