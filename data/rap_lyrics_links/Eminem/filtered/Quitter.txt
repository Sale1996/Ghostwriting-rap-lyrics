To all my fans, keepin y'all in health<end_line>
Let's tell this Whitey Ford to go fuck himself<end_line>
Cause it's cruel when you cause a bad heart conditionin<end_line>
which I create, cause that's my mission<end_line>
So listen close, to what we say<end_line>
because this type of fag claims to never be gay, I..<end_line>

<verse_start>
.. knew you was jealous from the day that I met you<end_line>
I upset you, cause I get respect I pet you<end_line>
I'm even liked better by your niece and nephew<end_line>
And now you hate Fred because Lethal left you<end_line>
Peckerwood mad cause his record went wood<end_line>
No respect in the hood, fled to his neck of the woods<end_line>
Got in touch with his roots, found the redneck in his blood<end_line>
and said, "Heck, country western rap records are good!!"<end_line>
So he picks the guitar up and he strums a few notes<end_line>
He can't rap, or sing, but he wants to do both<end_line>
Puts an album out and rules for part of the year<end_line>
then Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit come from out of nowhere<end_line>
It's the start of an era, rock rap's harder this year<end_line>
No one's tryin to hear some fuckin old fart in a chair<end_line>
sittin on stage, strummin acoustic guitar in your ear<end_line>
So you start to get scared, sit back and spark an idea<end_line>
Figure you can diss me to jump start your career<end_line>
I punch you in your fuckin chest 'til your heart kicks in gear<end_line>
And fuck your underground buddy's nameless crew<end_line>
Like I'ma say they names so they can be famous too<end_line>

Yo.. heart attack to stroke from the crack you smoke<end_line>
to the rap you wrote, your fuckin answer back's a joke<end_line>
And I'ma tell these motherfuckin fans the truth<end_line>
The reason why you dissed me first and I answered you<end_line>
You said I passed you in a lobby and I glanced at you<end_line>
like I ain't notice you?  BITCH, I had a show to do!<end_line>
Like I'm supposed to be star-struck, come over to you<end_line>
You better shut your fuckin mouth while you oh-for-two<end_line>
Back in ninety-four Limp opened the show for you<end_line>
Rocked the crowd better and stole the whole show from you<end_line>
Took your motherfuckin DJ and stole him too<end_line>
So you fall in a slump and get all emotional<end_line>
So now you sing and mix slang with blues and pluck strings<end_line>
Confused as fuck cause now your music sucks dick<end_line>
Mr. Mr. Ass Kisser to get accepted in rap<end_line>

<verse_end>

<verse_start>
First off, fuck your songs and the shit you say<end_line>
Diss my wife, but at least I got a bitch, you gay<end_line>
You claim to be a Muslim but you Irish White<end_line>
So fuck you fat boy, drop the mic, let's fight<end_line>
Plus I punch you in the chest, weak hearts I rip<end_line>
Whitey Ford, forty and white, lethargic ass dickhead<end_line>
I keep 'em comin while you runnin out of breath<end_line>
Steady duckin while I'm punchin at your chest, you need to rest<end_line>
Dilated, go ask your people how I leave ya<end_line>
with your three CD's, nobody sees, when they released<end_line>
Evidence, don't fuck around with real MC's<end_line>
who ain't ready for no underground beef, so fuck geeks<end_line>
I let you faggots know it's on for life<end_line>
but Everlast might die tonight, haha<end_line>
Fat boy murdered on wax and killed<end_line>
Fuck with me and take a heart pill, you know!<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Got in his ass and now this faggot wanna mention me still<end_line>
this ain't no freestyle battle Everlast gettin killed<end_line>
with his chest open<end_line>
Tryin to throw a fuckin punch, but you just chokin<end_line>
Havin a stroke and now you learn why crackers never earned a dime<end_line>
cause you SUCK motherfucker you should learn to rhyme<end_line>
Talkin 'bout you packin pistols but it's funny to me<end_line>
You ain't never been in trouble, you just wanna be me<end_line>
I'm a paleface killer whale<end_line>
on his way to fuckin prison, pistol whippin tail, ha<end_line>
Erik remember when I passed you in the lobby that day?<end_line>
That shit was obvious you probably was gay, ha<end_line>
Now it's all about country, you gave up hip-hop<end_line>
Forty-nine thousand copies, the week your shit drop<end_line>
while my sales makin records break<end_line>
Two and a half million scanned by the second week<end_line>
Motherfucker I hit 'em up!<end_line>

You a, "Black Jesus," heart attack seizures<end_line>
Too many cheeseburgers McDonald's Big Mac greases<end_line>
White devil, washed up honkey<end_line>
Mixed up cracker who crossed over to country<end_line>

<verse_start>
Fuck him, that's it, I'm done, I promise, I'm done, that's it<end_line>
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I promise<end_line>
I just believe in kickin a man while he's down<end_line>
