<verse_start>
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy<end_line>
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti<end_line>
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready<end_line>
to drops bombs, but he keeps on forgetting<end_line>
what he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud<end_line>
He opens his mouth but the words won't come out<end_line>
He's chokin, how? Everybody's jokin now<end_line>
The clock's run out, time's up, over - BLAOW!<end_line>
Snap back to reality, OHH - there goes gravity<end_line>
OHH - there goes Rabbit, he choked<end_line>
He's so mad, but he won't<end_line>
Give up that easy nope, he won't have it<end_line>
He knows, his whole back's to these ropes<end_line>
It don't matter, he's dope<end_line>
He knows that, but he's broke<end_line>
He's so sad that he knows <end_line>
when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's<end_line>
back to the lab again, yo, this whole rap shit<end_line>
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him<end_line>

<verse_start>
Soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping<end_line>
This world is mine for the taking<end_line>
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order<end_line>
A normal life is boring; but superstardom's<end_line>
close to post-mortem, it only grows harder<end_line>
Homie grows hotter, he blows it's all over<end_line>
These hoes is all on him, coast to coast shows<end_line>
He's known as the Globetrotter<end_line>
Lonely roads, God only knows<end_line>
He's grown farther from home, he's no father<end_line>
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter<end_line>
But hold your nose cause here goes the cold water<end_line>
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product<end_line>
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows<end_line>
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera<end_line>
is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old partner<end_line>
But the beat goes on da-da-dum da-dum da-dah<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
No more games, I'ma change what you call rage<end_line>
Tear this motherfuckin roof off like two dogs caged<end_line>
I was playin in the beginning, the mood all changed<end_line>
I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage<end_line>
But I kept rhymin and stepped right in the next cypher<end_line>
Best believe somebody's payin the pied piper<end_line>
All the pain inside amplified by the<end_line>
fact that I can't get by with my nine to<end_line>
five and I can't provide the right type of<end_line>
life for my family, cause man, these God damn<end_line>
food stamps don't buy diapers, and there's no movie<end_line>
There's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life<end_line>
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin even harder<end_line>
Tryin to feed and water my seed plus, teeter-totter<end_line>
Caught up between bein a father and a primadonna<end_line>
Baby momma drama screamin on her too much for me to wanna<end_line>
stay in one spot, another day of monotony<end_line>
has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got<end_line>
to formulate a plot, or end up in jail or shot<end_line>
Success is my only motherfuckin option, failure's not<end_line>
Mom I love you but this trailer's got to go<end_line>
I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot<end_line>
So here I go it's my shot, feet fail me not<end_line>
This may be the only opportunity that I got<end_line>
