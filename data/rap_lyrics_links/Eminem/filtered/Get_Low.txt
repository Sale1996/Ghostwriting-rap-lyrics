Yeah, once again it's on<end_line>
Young Statlanta live in this muh'fucker holmes<end_line>
The hoes get naked soon as the song come on<end_line>
The niggaz get wreckless, it's off the chain here gone<end_line>
It's poppin speakers knockin crowded off on the flo'<end_line>
They jockin it, watchin when I walks through the do'<end_line>
It's him, tell a friend but you already know<end_line>
Act stupid or lose it, don't bother to fuck with Quo<end_line>
I'm kind of different, he's not the usual<end_line>
Sippin Cognac in between two beautiful<end_line>
bitches in the club, talk shit it's your funeral<end_line>
I came to get a buzz and crunk, understand?<end_line>
It's crowded, it's packed, it's jumpin - goddamn it's swole<end_line>
I'm cooler than cool as my temperature's - 30 below<end_line>
I'm checkin the scene if a new cut - droppin the low<end_line>
Shakin they ass, backin it up Â– fast or slow<end_line>
