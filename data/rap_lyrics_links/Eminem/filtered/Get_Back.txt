I'm disappointed in my dentist appointment<end_line>
He only gave me the fuckin gas for thirty minutes this mornin<end_line>
Went to the hospital to get a chest X-ray<end_line>
Checked out the next day in a dress wit a sex change<end_line>
I'm havin a bad day<end_line>
My fuckin dad's gay, I hate fags, and I'm fuckin mad cuz I don't have AIDS<end_line>
All I want to do is die<end_line>
I tried suicide six times and couldn't even do it right<end_line>
Collapsed, had a relapse and called three cabs<end_line>
And had to be dragged back to rehab wit bloody kneecaps<end_line>
Enrolled myself in a twelve-step program<end_line>
Tripped on the first step and got pinned down in a chokeslam<end_line>
I swear to God, this 'Pac poster comes any closer <end_line>
I'm kickin this whole fuckin wall over<end_line>
Two more shots and it's all over<end_line>
I'm all over this wall, tryin not to fall over<end_line>
