<verse_start>
By the time you hear this I will have already spiralled up<end_line>
I would never do nothin to let you cowards fuck my world up<end_line>
If I was you I would duck - or get struck like lightnin<end_line>
Fighters keep fightin, put your lighters up, point 'em skyward, uhh!<end_line>
Had a dream, I was king, I woke up, still king<end_line>
This rap game's, nipple is mine, for the milking<end_line>
'Til nobody else even fuckin feels me, 'til it kills me<end_line>
I swear to God I'll be the fuckin illest in this music<end_line>
there is, or there ever will be; disagree, feel free<end_line>
But from now on I'm refusing <end_line>
to ever give up, only thing I ever gave up's using<end_line>
No more excuses, excuse me if my head is too big, for this building<end_line>
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick, but you cocks are slick<end_line>
Poppin shit on how you flipped your life around, crock of shit<end_line>
Who you +dicks+ tryin to +kid+? Flip "dick", you did opposite<end_line>
You stayed the same cause "cock" backwards is still "cock" you pricks!<end_line>
I love it when I tell 'em shove it<end_line>
Cause it wasn't that, long ago when Marshall sat, flustered lacked luster<end_line>
Cause he couldn't cut mustard<end_line>
Muster up nothin, brain fuzzy cause he's buzzin, woke up from that buzzer<end_line>
Now you wonder why he does it how he does it, wasn't cause he had buzzards<end_line>
circlin around his head, waitin for him to drop dead, was it?<end_line>
Or was it cause them bitches wrote him off? Little hussy ass scuzzes<end_line>
Fuck it, guess it doesn't matter now, does it?<end_line>
What difference it make? What's it take <end_line>
to get it through your thick skulls that this ain't<end_line>
some bullshit people don't usually come back this way<end_line>
From a place that was dark as I was in just to get to this place<end_line>
Now let these words be like a switchblade to a hater's ribcage!<end_line>
And let it be known that from this day forward I wanna just say thanks<end_line>
cause your hate is what gave me this strength<end_line>
So let them Bic's raise<end_line>
Cause I came with 5'9" but I feel like I'm 6'8"!<end_line>
