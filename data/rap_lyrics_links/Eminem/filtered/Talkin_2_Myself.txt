So why in the world, do I feel so alone?<end_line>
Nobody but me, I'm on my own<end_line>
Is there anyone out there, who feels the way I feel?<end_line>
If there is then let me hear just so I know that I'm not the only one<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I went away I guess and opened up some lanes<end_line>
But there was no one who even knew I was goin through, growin pains<end_line>
Hatred was flowin through my veins, on the verge of goin insane<end_line>
I almost made a song dissin Lil Wayne<end_line>
It's like I was jealous of him cause of the attention he was gettin<end_line>
I felt horrible about myself, he was spittin<end_line>
and I wasn't, anyone who was buzzin back then coulda got it<end_line>
Almost went at Kanye too, God it<end_line>
feels like I'm goin psychotic, thank God that I didn't do it<end_line>
I'da had my ass handed to me, and I knew it<end_line>
But Proof isn't here to see me through it<end_line>
I'm in the booth, poppin another pill, tryin to talk myself into it<end_line>
Are you stupid? You're gon' start dissin people for no reason?<end_line>
'Specially when you can't even write a decent punchline even?<end_line>
You're lyin to yourself, you're slowly dyin, you're denyin your health<end_line>
is declinin with your self-esteem, you're cryin out for help<end_line>

Marshall you're no longer the man, that's a bitter pill to swallow<end_line>
All I know is I'm wallowin, self-loathin and hollow<end_line>
Bottoms up on the pill bottle, maybe I'll hit my bottom tomorrow<end_line>
My sorrow echoes in this hall though<end_line>
But I must be talkin to the wall though, I don't see nobody else<end_line>
But all these other rappers suck is all that I know<end_line>
I've turned into a hater, I put up a false bravado<end_line>
But Marshall is not an egomaniac, that's not his motto<end_line>
He's not a desperado, he's desperate, his thoughts are bottled<end_line>
inside him; one foot on the brake, one on the throttle<end_line>
Fallin asleep with writer's block in the parking lot at McDonald's<end_line>
But instead of feelin sorry for yourself do somethin 'bout it<end_line>
Admit you got a problem, your brain is clouded, you pouted<end_line>
long enough, it isn't them it's you you fuckin baby<end_line>
Quit worryin 'bout what they do and do Shady, I'm fuckin goin crazy<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
So I picked myself off the ground and fuckin swam 'fore I drowned<end_line>
Hit my bottom so hard I bounced twice, suffice, this time around<end_line>
it's different, them last two albums didn't count<end_line>
"Encore" I was on drugs, "Relapse" I was flushin 'em out<end_line>
I've come to make it up to ya now, no more fuckin around<end_line>
I got somethin to prove to fans cause I feel like I let 'em down<end_line>
So please accept my apology, I finally feel like I'm back to normal<end_line>
I feel like me again, let me formally<end_line>
reintroduce myself to you for those of you who don't know<end_line>
The new me's back to the old me and homie I don't show no<end_line>
signs of slowin up, oh and I'm blowin up all over<end_line>
My life is no longer a movie but the show ain't over homos<end_line>
I'm back with a vengeance homie, Weezy keep ya head up<end_line>
T.I. keep ya head up, Kanye keep ya head up, don't let up<end_line>
Just keep slayin 'em, rest in peace to DJ AM<end_line>
Cause I know what it's like, I struggle with this shit every single day and um<end_line>
<verse_end>
