Yesterday was the tornado warning, today's like the morning after<end_line>
Your world is torn in half, you wake in its wake to start the mournin process<end_line>
and rebuildin, you're still a work in progress<end_line>
Today's a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous ass, uh<end_line>
Thunderstorm has passed ya<end_line>
You weathered it and poke its eye out with the thorn bush that ya<end_line>
used to smell the roses, stopped to inhale can't even tell your nose is<end_line>
stuffed, so focused on the bright side then you floor the gas ped-<end_line>
-al and hit the corner fast, the<end_line>
more assertive never lookin back may hit the curb but every day's a new learning curve as ya<end_line>
steer through life, sometimes you might not wanna swerve but you have ta<end_line>
to avert a disaster, lucky no permanent damage<end_line>
Cause they hurt you so bad, it's like they murdered your ass<end_line>
and threw dirt on your casket, but you've returned from the ash-<end_line>
-es and that hurt that you have, you just converted to gas-<end_line>
-oline and while you're burnin the past, stand in that inferno and chant<end_line>

<verse_start>
You're so familiarized with what havin to swallow this pill is like<end_line>
It happens all the time, they take your heart and steal your life<end_line>
And it's as though you feel you've died, cause you've been killed inside<end_line>
But yet you're still alive, which means you will survive<end_line>
Although today you may weep cause you're weakened<end_line>
And everything seems so bleak and hopeless, the light that you're seekin<end_line>
It begins, to seep in, that's the only thing keepin<end_line>
you from leapin, off the mother-freakin, deep end!<end_line>
And I'm pullin for you to push through this feelin<end_line>
And with a little time that should do the healin<end_line>
And by tomorrow you may even feel so good that you're willin to forgive 'em<end_line>
even after all that shit you've been put through, this feelin of resilience is buildin<end_line>
And the flames are burnin quick as fire would through this building<end_line>
You're sealed in but you're fire-proof, flame retardant, you withstood it<end_line>
And as you climb up to the roof you're just chillin<end_line>
You look down cause you're so over 'em, you could put the heel of your foot through the ceiling!<end_line>
As time passes, things change every day<end_line>
But wounds, wounds heal but scars still remainin the same<end_line>
But tomorrow today's goin down in flames<end_line>
Throw the match, set the past ablaze<end_line>
So feel the fire beneath your feet as you barely even perspire from the heat<end_line>
Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief, as you say goodbye to the grief<end_line>
It's like watchin the walls melt in your prison cell, but you've extinguished this livin hell!<end_line>
Still a little piece of you dies as you scream<end_line>
