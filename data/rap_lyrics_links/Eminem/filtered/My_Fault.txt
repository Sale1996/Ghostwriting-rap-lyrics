I went to John's rave with Ron and Dave<end_line>
And met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved<end_line>
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up<end_line>
with first aid tape and raped on the first date<end_line>
Susan -- an ex-heroin addict who just stopped usin<end_line>
who love booze and alternative music<end_line>
Told me she was goin back into usin again<end_line>
I said, "Wait, first try this hallucinogen<end_line>
It's better than heroin, Henn, the booze or the gin<end_line>
C'mere, let's go in here"  *knocks on the door*<end_line>
"Who's in the den?"<end_line>
"It's me and Kelly!"<end_line>
"My bad,let's try another room"<end_line>
I don't trust you!<end_line>
"Shut up slut!  Chew up this mushroom<end_line>
This'll help you get in touch with your roots<end_line>
We'll get barefoot, buttnaked, and run in the woods<end_line>
Oh hell, I might as well try em, this party is so drab<end_line>
"Oh dag!!"<end_line>
"I ain't mean for you to eat the whole bag!"<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
"Yo Sue!"<end_line>
Get away from me, I don't know you<end_line>
Oh shoot, she's tripping..<end_line>
I need to go puke!! <end_line>
I wasn't tryin to turn this into somethin major<end_line>
I just wanted to make you appreciate nature<end_line>
Susan, stop cryin, I don't hate ya<end_line>
The world's not against you, I'm sorry your father raped you<end_line>
So what you had your little coochie in your dad's mouth?<end_line>
That ain't no reason to start wiggin and spaz out<end_line>
She said,<end_line>
Help me I think I'm havin a seisure!<end_line>
I said, "I'm high too bitch, quit grabbin my t-shirt" <end_line>
"Would you calm down you're startin to scare me"<end_line>
She said,<end_line>
I'm twenty-six years old and I'm not married<end_line>
    I don't even have any kids and I can't cook<end_line>
I'm over here Sue,you're talkin to the plant, look!<end_line>
We need to get to a hospital 'fore it's too late <end_line>
Cause I never seen no-one eat as many shrooms as you ate<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
My God, I'm so sorry!<end_line>
I'm so sorry!  Susan please wake up!<end_line>
Please!  Please wake up!!  What are you doing?!<end_line>
You're not dead!!  You're NOT dead!<end_line>
I know you're not dead!  Oh my God!<end_line>
Susan wake up!  Oh God...<end_line>
