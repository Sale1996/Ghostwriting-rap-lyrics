Nothing can stop and nothing can change<end_line>
And you better just make new livin' arrangments<end_line>
If you think, you the top and king of the castle<end_line>
You about to be thrown off the throne and ripped a new asshole<end_line>
All I hear is I'm the best at this and I'm best at that<end_line>
But I don't hear my name, no ?? brought up in rap<end_line>
And I don't usually trip or damn get caught up in that<end_line>
But when they say one of the best, I'm nowhere thought up as that<end_line>
Not even the same leage as Jay-Z, Nas, Pac, Biggie or maybe<end_line>
The name me somewhere down at the bottom, right after AZ<end_line>
Or say he ripped that Biggie verse, or that Jay-Z<end_line>
Yo his verses were crazy, on that "Renegade" beat<end_line>
But I ain't never bought no whole CD of Shady<end_line>
And all I hear is pop tunes come on the Radi-O<end_line>
And they play 'em 20 times in a row daily<end_line>
And they very well maybe<end_line>
The same reason they don't say me<end_line>
When they speak on hip-hop legends which is amaze me<end_line>
Cause I thought the formula was to hit mainstream<end_line>
And make it big ba big big bay ba baby<end_line>
