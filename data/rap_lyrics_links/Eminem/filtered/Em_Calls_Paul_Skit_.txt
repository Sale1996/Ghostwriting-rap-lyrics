'Ey yo Paul<end_line>
It's Em<end_line>
I got your call about the Michael Jackson thing<end_line>
And I know that he's not "Thrilled" about the video<end_line>
What does he "Wanna be Startin' Somethin"?<end_line>
Er-wow<end_line>
Well I'll show him who's really "Bad"<end_line>
Paul, "The Way You Make Me Feel" with these calls<end_line>
You should really take a look at the "Man In The Mirror" <end_line>
And tell him to "Beat it" because I "Won't stop 'til I get enough"<end_line>
Do you "Remember The Time" we were watching the "Billy Jean" video?<end_line>
Well he'll always be that Michael to me<end_line>
And it doesn't matter if he's "Black or White"<end_line>
Because I "Can't Stop Loving" him and I hate plastic surgeons<end_line>
And I hope they all fucking diiiiiiie!<end_line>
How do you like that?<end_line>
And I like him, I like him a lot<end_line>
I want to touch him but I can't<end_line>
Excuse me, I'm taking a shit<end_line>
Anyways, call me back<end_line>
I have this idea about how I want to end the show<end_line>
So, hit me when you get this message fucker<end_line>
Oh, and by the way<end_line>
No I don't have a new gun <end_line>
