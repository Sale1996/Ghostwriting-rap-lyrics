<verse_start>
As I, fall deeper into a manic state<end_line>
I'm a prime candidate for the gene to receive the drug addict traits<end_line>
Blood pressure climbs at a dramatic rate<end_line>
I seem to gravitate to the bottle of NyQuil then I salivate<end_line>
Start off with the night well like "I think I'll just have a taste"<end_line>
Couple of sips of that, then I gradually graduate<end_line>
To a harder prescription drug called Valium like "Ya that's great"<end_line>
I go to just take one and I end up like having eight<end_line>
Now I need something in my stomach cause I haven't ate<end_line>
Maybe I'll grab a plate of nachos and I'll have a steak<end_line>
And you'd think that with all I have at stake, look at my daughter's face<end_line>
"Mommy something is wrong with dad I think<end_line>
He's acting weird again he's really beginning to scare me<end_line>
Won't shave his beard again and he pretends he doesn't hear me<end_line>
And all he does is eat Doritos and Cheetos<end_line>
And he just fell asleep in his car eating Three Musketeers in the rear seat"<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Maybe just a nice cold brew "What's a beer?"<end_line>
That's the devil in my ear I been sober a fuckin year<end_line>
And that fucker still talks to me he's all I can fuckin hear<end_line>
"Marshall come on we'll watch the game, it's the Cowboys and Buccaneers"<end_line>
And maybe if I just drink half, I'll be half buzzed for half of the time<end_line>
Who's the mastermind behind that little line?<end_line>
With that kind of rationale man I got half a mind<end_line>
To have another half of glass of wine, sound asinine<end_line>
Yeah I know, but I never had no problem with alcohol<end_line>
Ouch look out for the wall, aim for the couch I'm 'bout to fall<end_line>
I missed the couch and down I go looking like a bouncy ball<end_line>
Shit must've knocked me out, cause I ain't feel the ground at all<end_line>
Wow, what the fuck happened last night, where am I?<end_line>
Man, fuck am I hungover and God damn I<end_line>
Got a headache, shit half a Vicodin, why can't I?<end_line>
"All systems ready for take off please stand by"<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
So I take a Vicodin splash it hits my stomach then ahh<end_line>
Couple of weeks go by it ain't even like I'm getting high<end_line>
Now I need it just not to feel sick, ya I'm getting by<end_line>
Wouldn't even be taking this shit if DeShaun didn't die<end_line>
Oh yeah, there's an excuse, you lose Proof so you use<end_line>
There's new rules, it's cool if it's helpin you to get through<end_line>
It's twelve noon, ain't no harm in self inducing a snooze<end_line>
What else is new? Fuck it what would Elvis do in your shoes?<end_line>
Now here I am three months later, full blown re-lapse<end_line>
"Just get high until the kids get home from school homes relax"<end_line>
And since I'm, convinced that I'm an insom-niac<end_line>
I need these pills to be able to sleep so I take three naps<end_line>
Just to be able to function throughout the day, let's see<end_line>
That's an Ambien each nap, how many Valium, three?<end_line>
And that will average out to about one good hour's, sleep<end_line>
Ok so now ya, see, the reason how come, he<end_line>
Has taken four years to just put out an album, B<end_line>
See me and you we almost had the same outcome, Heath<end_line>
Cause that Christmas you know the whole pneumonia, thing<end_line>
It was bologna was it the methadone ya, think<end_line>
Or the hydrocordone, you hide inside your pornos<end_line>
Your VCR tape cases, with you Ambien CR, great paces to hide 'em ain't it<end_line>
So you can lie to Hailie, "I'm going beddy bye Whitney baby good night Alaina"<end_line>
Go in the room and shut the bedroom door, and wake up in an ambulance<end_line>
They said they found me on the bathroom floor, damn<end_line>
