<verse_start>
Everybody's in a rush, to try and get the throne<end_line>
I just get on the track, and try to set the tone<end_line>
I ain't tryna use nobody, as a stepping stone<end_line>
But don't compare me, I'm better off, just left alone<end_line>
And I ain't even tryna go there, with record sales<end_line>
I'm just tryna keep it humble, and respect myself<end_line>
Say what up, keep stepping, and just rep D-12<end_line>
Keep my nose clean and stay away from, weapons, jail<end_line>
And living reckless, but if you gon' check my belt<end_line>
You may see something else, I use to protect myself<end_line>
A vest, to stop a Ruger, and deflect its shells<end_line>
And send 'em back at you, faster than they left the barrel<end_line>
And I don't even carry guns no more, I don't got to<end_line>
Got undercover cops, that'll legally pop you<end_line>
And I den seen a lotta people, cross the line<end_line>
But this motherfucker Ja, must have lost his mind<end_line>
That ex, got him thinking he was DMX<end_line>
Then he switched to Pac, now he's tryna be him next<end_line>
So which one are you, X, Luther, Pac or Michael<end_line>
Just keep singing the same song, recycled<end_line>
We all much rather get along, than fight you<end_line>
Me and Halie dance to ya songs, we like you<end_line>
And you don't really wanna step inside no mic booth<end_line>
Come on now, you know the white boy will bite you<end_line>
I hurt ya pride dog, and you know I don't like to<end_line>
But I will if I have to, wit syllable after<end_line>
Syllable I'll just slap ya, killin you faster<end_line>
Then you popin' pill after, little pill of them tabs of<end_line>
That shit you're on, but if you want it, you got it<end_line>
You'd bump this shit too, if we ain't diss you on it<end_line>
But if we lock horns, we could charge harder than Busta<end_line>
We bump heads, wit any motherfucka that wants ta<end_line>
So what's the, deal, what's with all the tough talk<end_line>
When I walked up to you, like "Ja, what up dog?"<end_line>
How come you didn't say, you had a problem then<end_line>
When you were standing there with all ya men<end_line>
We could have solved it then, I'm a grown man dog, come holla<end_line>
All you did was laugh then, smile and swallow<end_line>
Another one of those little ex pills, in front of me<end_line>
And tell me 50 Cent was everything, that you wanna be, come on<end_line>
