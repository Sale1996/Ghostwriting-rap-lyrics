There's several different levels to Devil worshippin: horse's heads,<end_line>
human sacrifices, canibalism; candles and exorcism<end_line>
Animals havin sex with 'em; camels mammals and rabbits<end_line>
But I don't get into that, I kick the habit - I just,<end_line>
beat you to death with weapons that eat through the flesh<end_line>
And I never eat you unless the fuckin, meat looks fresh<end_line>
I got a lion in my pocket, I'm lyin, I got a nine in my pocket<end_line>
and baby I'm just, dyin to cock him<end_line>
He's ready for war, I'm ready for war<end_line>
I got machetes and swords for any faggot that said he was raw<end_line>
My uz' as, heavy as yours, yeah you met me before<end_line>
I just didn't have as large an arsenal of weapons before<end_line>
Marshall will step in the door, I lay your head on the floor<end_line>
With your body spread on the bedspread, red on the wall<end_line>
red on the ceilin, red on the floor, get a new whore<end_line>
Met on the second, wet on the third;<end_line>
then she's dead on the fourth - I'm dead wrong<end_line>
