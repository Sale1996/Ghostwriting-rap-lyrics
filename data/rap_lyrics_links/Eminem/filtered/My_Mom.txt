My mom, my mom! I know you're probably tired <end_line>
of hearin 'bout my mom Â– oh-ho, whoa-ho<end_line>
But this is just a story of when I was just a shorty<end_line>
and how I became hooked on Va-aliu-ums<end_line>
Valium was in everything, food that I ate<end_line>
The water that I drank, fuckin peas on my plate<end_line>
She sprinkled just enough of it to season my steak<end_line>
So every day I'd have at least three stomachaches<end_line>
Now tell me, what kinda mother would wanna see her<end_line>
son grow up to be an under-a-fuckin-chiever<end_line>
My teacher didn't think I was gonna be nothin either<end_line>
"What the fuck you stickin gum up under the fuckin seat for?<end_line>
Mrs. Mathers, your son has been huffin ether<end_line>
Either that or the motherfucker's been puffin reefer"<end_line>
But all this huffin and puffin wasn't what it was either<end_line>
It was neither, I was buzzin but it wasn't what she thought<end_line>
Pee in a teacup? Bitch you ain't my keeper<end_line>
I'm sleepin, what the fuck you keep on fuckin with me for?<end_line>
Slut you need to leave me the - fuck alone<end_line>
I ain't playin, go find you a white crayon and color a fuckin zebra<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Wait a minute, this ain't dinner, this is paint thinner<end_line>
"You ate it yesterday, I ain't hear no complaints, did I?<end_line>
Now here's a plate full of painkillers, now just wait 'til<end_line>
I crush the Valium and put it in your potatoes<end_line>
Ya little motherfucker, I'll make you sit there and make that <end_line>
retarded fuckin face without even tastin it<end_line>
You better lick the fuckin plate, you ain't wastin it<end_line>
Put your face in it 'fore I throw you in the basement again<end_line>
And I ain't givin in - you're gonna just sit there<end_line>
in one fuckin place finnickin 'til next Thanksgiving and<end_line>
if you still ain't finished it I'll use the same shit again<end_line>
Then when I make spinach dip it'll be placed in the shit<end_line>
You little shit, wanna sit there and play innocent?<end_line>
A rack fell and hit me in K-Mart and they witnessed it<end_line>
Child support, your father he ain't sent the shit<end_line>
And so what if he did? It's none of your dang business kid!"<end_line>
My mom - there's no one else quite like my mom<end_line>
I know I should let bygones be bygones<end_line>
But she's the reason why I am high on what I'm high on<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
My mom loved Valium, now all I am<end_line>
is a party animal, I am what I am<end_line>
But I'm strong to the finish with me Valium spinach<end_line>
But my bars only last about two minutes<end_line>
But I don't wanna swallow it without chewin it<end_line>
I can't even write a rhyme without you in it<end_line>
My Valium, my Vaaaaaa-liummmm, ohhhhhhh<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Man I never thought that I could ever be<end_line>
a drug addict, naw, fuck that I can't have it happen to me<end_line>
But that's actually, what has ended up happenin<end_line>
A tregedy; the fuckin past ended up catchin me<end_line>
And it's, probably where I got acquainted with the taste, ain't it?<end_line>
Pharmaceuticals are the bomb ma, beautiful!<end_line>
She killed the fuckin dog with the medicine she done fed it<end_line>
Feed it a fuckin aspirin and say that it has a headache<end_line>
"Here, want a snack? You hungry you fuckin brat?<end_line>
Look at that, it's a Xanax, take it and take a nap<end_line>
Eat it!" But I don't need it! "Well fuck it then break it up<end_line>
Take a little piece and beat it before you wake Nathan up!"<end_line>
Aight Ma you win, I don't feel like arguin<end_line>
I'll do it, pop it, gobble it and start wobblin<end_line>
Stumble, hobble, tumble, slip, trip then I fall in bed<end_line>
with a bottle of meds and a Heath Ledger bobblehead<end_line>
<verse_end>
