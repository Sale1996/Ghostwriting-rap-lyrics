We just came to party<end_line>
And I'm feelin' good<end_line>
I got the Remy for any women that's feeling loose<end_line>
Your man grillin' and he just up on my tennis shoes<end_line>
I think we met, we gettin' checks like<end_line>
You see her shinin' with diamonds, glass, a swimmin' pool<end_line>
All the women drool, when they see the linen jewels<end_line>
The way you drifted by, it really got me in the mood<end_line>
Take me to the room and blow me up like a inner clue<end_line>

I don't got no time for these niggas that's playing games<end_line>
I don't take it as a diss unless you sayin' my name<end_line>
I'm a bad influence, I smoke weed in front of kids<end_line>
I crack a bottle open and ask 'em<end_line>
If they wanna swig<end_line>
I'm the bad guy that touched your wife<end_line>
Tip Toe ain't nothin' nice<end_line>
I rob Benz and still sport a gang of ice<end_line>
We gettin' money, we ain't trippin' off you hoe niggas<end_line>
Cause if we want you, we'll come show up at your show, niggas<end_line>

And I'm livin' it Thug Life, like I was Makaveli and<end_line>
Nigga, this Zoo Life, nigga, I ride for it<end_line>
I'll die for it and do federal time for it<end_line>
I'm a Inglewood nigga, just have it at any brother<end_line>
I ain't started gangbangin' because of my favorite color<end_line>
I done flip the whole brick<end_line>

Got socas in line, dancin' like it's Soul Train<end_line>
