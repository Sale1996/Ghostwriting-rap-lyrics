<verse_start>
I live, in a bubble, I struggle with the fame<end_line>
Trouble is the pain, grows double, give a fuck what you say<end_line>
When my music you take, so, subtle just to give it away<end_line>
to people who don't even appreciate flows motherfucker, I'm livid today<end_line>
Cause I break my back to give you my art<end_line>
You steal my thoughts, it's like drivin a spike through my heart<end_line>
You might not think it's that big of a deal to steal from me but music's all I got<end_line>
Aside from my daughters, not to sound like a martyr but it's gettin harder than I thought<end_line>
to not just go crazy trapped in this house, I'm about to just snap, am I not<end_line>
deservin of what I got? Did I not work for it? Put it all on every record I record<end_line>
Well then please tell me why on this earth Lord <end_line>
does it keep happenin? I keep rappin but I wonder sometimes is it worth all<end_line>
the bullshit cause it feels like a down there ain't no gettin up from<end_line>
But I won't let it get me down, I won't succumb, I'm anything but glum so FUCK 'EM~!<end_line>
They'll appreciate me when I'm gone, they'll say I was ill, right? The way I killed mics<end_line>
But the way I feel right now it just feels like <end_line>
I'm so done with this shit that I may as well wipe<end_line>
I have nothin else to give you, nothin else to contribute, farewell I bid you<end_line>
But before I go my last gift to you, ladies and gentlemen Slaughterhouse I GIVE YOU!<end_line>
<verse_end>
