You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em<end_line>
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em<end_line>
Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causin mayhem<end_line>
When I say I'ma do somethin I do it, I don't give a damn<end_line>
what you think, I'm doin this for me, so fuck the world feed it beans<end_line>
It's gassed up, if it thinks it's stoppin me<end_line>
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly<end_line>
And all those who looked down on me I'm tearin down your balcony<end_line>
No if ands or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he<end_line>
From "Infinite" down to that last "Relapse" album he's<end_line>
still shittin, whether he's on salary, paid hourly<end_line>
until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him<end_line>
Whichever comes first, for better or worse<end_line>
He's married to the game, like a fuck you for Christmas, his gift is a curse<end_line>
Forget the Earth, he's got the urge to pull his dick from the dirt<end_line>
And fuck the whole universe<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Okay quit playin with the scissors and shit, and cut the crap<end_line>
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a wrap<end_line>
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth, for that<end_line>
Fuck your fillings, instead of gettin crowned you're gettin capped<end_line>
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again I'm back<end_line>
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact<end_line>
Let's be honest, that last "Relapse" CD was ehhh<end_line>
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground<end_line>
Relax, I ain't goin back to that now<end_line>
All I'm tryin to say is get back, click-clack, blaow<end_line>
Cause I ain't playin around<end_line>
There's a game called circle and I don't know how, I'm way too up to back down<end_line>
But I think I'm still tryin to figure this crap out<end_line>
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn't, this fuckin black cloud<end_line>
still follows, me around - but it's time to exorcise these demons<end_line>
These muh'fuckers are doin jumpin jacks now!<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
And I just can't keep living this way<end_line>
So starting today, I'm breaking out of this caaaaage<end_line>
I'm standing up, I'ma face my demons<end_line>
I'm manning up, I'ma hold my ground<end_line>
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up<end_line>
Time to put my life back together right now!<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me<end_line>
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally<end_line>
for you, so I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through<end_line>
And don't even realize what you did cause believe me you<end_line>
I've been through the wringer, but they could do little to the middle finger<end_line>
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of<end_line>
my world, haters can make like bees with no stingers<end_line>
and drop dead, no more beef lingers<end_line>
No more drama, from now on I promise <end_line>
to focus solely on handlin my responsibilities as a father<end_line>
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof, like my daughters<end_line>
and raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it!<end_line>
Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club<end_line>
or the corner pub, and lift the whole liquor counter up<end_line>
Cause I'm raising the bar<end_line>
I'd shoot for the moon but I'm too busy gazin at stars<end_line>
I feel amazing and I'm not<end_line>
<verse_end>
