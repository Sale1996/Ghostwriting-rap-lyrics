<verse_start>
If I could rewind time like a tape<end_line>
Inside a boombox, one day for every pill, or Percocet that I ate<end_line>
Cut down on the Valium, I'da heard everything<end_line>
But death is turnin so definite, wait!<end_line>
They got me all hooked up to some machine<end_line>
I love you being, didn't want you to know I was struggling!<end_line>
Feels like I'm underwater submerged like a submarine<end_line>
Just heard that nurse say, my liver and kidneys aren't functioning<end_line>
Been flirtatious with death, skirt-chasin I guess, it's arrivederci<end_line>
Same nurse just heard say they're unpluggin me<end_line>
And it's your birthday, Jade I'm missin your birthday<end_line>
Baby girl I'm sorry, I fuckin hate when you hurt, Hai'<end_line>
And sweeties, thank you for waitin to open gifts<end_line>
But girls, you can just open 'em, Dad ain't makin it home for Christmas<end_line>
Wish I had the strength to just blow a kiss<end_line>
I go to make a fist, but I can't make one, I'm frozen stiff<end_line>
I yell but nothin comes out, I'm cryin inside, I shout<end_line>
My vocal cords won't permit me, I scream but it's not aloud/allowed<end_line>
You put your arm around Momma to calm her, wow<end_line>
I just thought about the aisle I'll never get to walk you's down<end_line>
Never see you, graduate in your caps and gowns<end_line>
It's 'bout to be 2008, how's this happenin now?<end_line>
I've got so much more to do<end_line>
And Proof, I'm truly sorry if I let you down but this tore me in two<end_line>
The thought of no more me and you<end_line>
You gave me shoes, Nikes like new, for me for school<end_line>
Doody I'm tryin, but you, you were the glue that binded<end_line>
so many things; time, I'd give anything to rewind it<end_line>
I had to walk down my halls and constantly be reminded<end_line>
by pictures all on my walls and I couldn't sleep at night cause<end_line>
that image burned in my brain of you on that table<end_line>
Me fallin across your body, not able to stand to save you<end_line>
God, why did you take him?<end_line>
I'm tryna keep his legacy alive but I'm dyin, where's Nathan?<end_line>
Little ladies be brave, take care of your mother<end_line>
Smile pretty for pictures, always cherish each other<end_line>
I'll always love ya, and I'll be in the back of your memory<end_line>
And I know you'll never forget me, just don't get sad when remembering<end_line>
And little bro, keep makin me proud<end_line>
You better marry that girl cause she's faithfully down<end_line>
And when you're exchangin those sacred vows, just know that if I could be there I would<end_line>
And should you ever see parenthood, I know you'll be good at it<end_line>
Oh, almost forgot to do somethin, thank my father too<end_line>
I actually learned a lot from you, you taught me what not to do<end_line>
And Mom, wish I'd have had the chance<end_line>
to have one last heart-to-heart honest and open talk with you<end_line>
Doody I see you, I go to walk to you<end_line>
And I can feel my soul leave my body and float across the room<end_line>
Nurses lean over the bed, pullin tubes out<end_line>
Then the sheet over my head, shut the room down<end_line>
Girls, please don't get upset, I see them cheeks soakin and wet<end_line>
As you squeeze hold of my neck, so forcibly don't wanna let<end_line>
me go, pillow drenched, emotional wrecks<end_line>
With every second each closer to death<end_line>
But suddenly I feel my heart begin to beat slow<end_line>
Then a breath, machines go<end_line>
Must've guessed the cheat codes to this shit<end_line>
I'm tryna rewind time like a tape<end_line>
Find an escape, make a beeline, try and awake<end_line>
from this dream I, need to re-find, my inner strength<end_line>
to remind, me even if a steep climb I must take<end_line>
To rewrite a mistake, I'm rewindin the tape<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I don't want it!<end_line>
I'll put out this last album then I'm done with it<end_line>
100% finished, fed up with it, I'm hangin it up, FUCK IT!<end_line>
Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know<end_line>
that I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold<end_line>
And if things should worsen, but I bet you they won't<end_line>
I'm pledgin to throw this methadone in the toilet<end_line>
Shred these old letters I wrote, on that old pathetic loathing<end_line>
Closing credits can roll, I'm proud to, be back<end_line>
I'm 'bout to/two, like a rematch, outdo "Relapse"<end_line>
with "Recovery", "Mathers LP 2", help propel me to, victory laps<end_line>
Gas toward 'em and fast forward the past<end_line>
Consider them last four minutes as<end_line>
the song I'da sang to my daughters<end_line>
if I'da made it to the hospital less than two hours later, but I fought it<end_line>
And, came back like a boomerang on 'em, now a new day is dawnin<end_line>
I'm up, Tuesday, it's morning, now I know<end_line>
