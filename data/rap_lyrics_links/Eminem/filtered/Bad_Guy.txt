<verse_start>
It's like I'm in this dirt diggin up old hurt<end_line>
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work<end_line>
All it takes is one song on the radio, you're - right back on it<end_line>
remindin me all over again how you fuckin just brushed me off and left me so burnt<end_line>
Spent a lot of time tryin to soul search<end_line>
Maybe I needed to grow up a little first, well looks like I hit a growth spurt<end_line>
But I'm comin for closure<end_line>
Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed for<end_line>
the way that you turned your back on me just when I may have needed you most<end_line>
Oh, you thought it was over; you can just close the<end_line>
chapter and go about your life like it was nothin<end_line>
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doin fine, well I've never recovered<end_line>
But tonight, betcha that what ya<end_line>
'bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered<end_line>
Can't think of a, better way to define poetic justice<end_line>
Can I hold grudges? Mind's sayin "Let it go, fuck this"<end_line>
Heart's sayin "I will once I bury this bitch alive, hide the shovel<end_line>
and then drive off in the sunset, and"<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
And to think, I used to think you was the shit, bitch<end_line>
To think it was you at one time I worshipped? Shit<end_line>
Think you can hurt people and just keep gettin away with, it?<end_line>
Not this time, you better go and get the sewing kit, bitch<end_line>
Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sow, +knit+, wit<end_line>
Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it? Forget, it<end_line>
You left our family in shambles, you expect me to just get<end_line>
over him? Pretend he never exis-ted?<end_line>
May be gone but he's not forgotten, and don't think cause he's been out the picture<end_line>
so long that I've stopped the plottin, and still ain't comin to getcha<end_line>
You're wrong and that shit was rotten, and the way you played him's same shit you did to<end_line>
me, cold! Have you any idea the<end_line>
shit that I've gone through? Feelings I harbor, all this pent-up resentment I hold onto<end_line>
Not once you call to ask me how I'm doin, letters you don't respond to 'em<end_line>
Fuck it, I'm comin to see you<end_line>
And gee, who better to talk to than you? The cause of my problems<end_line>
My life is garbage and I'm 'bout to take it out on you<end_line>
Poof, then I'm gone, voosh - and<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I've been drivin around your side of this town<end_line>
like 9 frickin hours and 45 minutes now, finally I found<end_line>
your new address, park in your drive, feel like I've been waitin on this moment all of my life and<end_line>
it's now arrived and my mouth is full of saliva<end_line>
My knife is out and I'm duckin on the side of your house, see it's<end_line>
sad it came to this point, such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya<end_line>
But ain't here for your empathy<end_line>
I don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy<end_line>
It's revenge that I seek, so I sneak<end_line>
vengefully and treat your bedroom window like I reach my full potential, I peaked/peeked<end_line>
Continue to peep, still bent low<end_line>
Then keep tappin the glass lightly then start to crescendo<end_line>
Sneak all the way 'round to the back porch, man<end_line>
Door handle's unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this, you don't plan for intruders beforehand?<end_line>
Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?<end_line>
Gag, chloroform rag, dag, almost hack up a lung <end_line>
Like you picked an axe up and swung<end_line>
Stick to the core plan, dragged to the back of a trunk<end_line>
by one of your fans, irony's spectacular, huh? Now who's a faggot, you punk?<end_line>
And here's your Bronco hat, you can have that shit back cause they SUCK!<end_line>
It's just me, you and the music now Slim, I hope you hear it<end_line>
We're in a car right now, wait, here comes my favorite lyric<end_line>
"I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die"<end_line>
And hey, here's the sequel to my Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy<end_line>
Well how's this for publicity stunt? This should be fun<end_line>
Last album now cause after this you'll be, officially done<end_line>
Eminem killed by M and M, Mathew Mitchell<end_line>
Bitch, I even have your initials!<end_line>
I initially was, gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it<end_line>
Since you're in love with your city so much I figured what the fuck, the<end_line>
best place you could be buried alive is right here<end_line>
Two more exits, time is quite near, hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear<end_line>
That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea<end_line>
as cops appear in my driver's side mirror<end_line>
OHH GOD, POLICE!<end_line>
AHHH! Hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot at least<end_line>
New plan Stan, Slim, chauvinist pig<end_line>
Drove in this big Lincoln Town Car, well gotta go, almost at the bridge<end_line>
Haha, big bro it's for you, Slim, this is for him<end_line>
and Frank Ocean, oh hope you can +Swim Good+! Now say you hate homos AGAIN!<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I also represent<end_line>
anyone on the receivin end of those jokes you offend<end_line>
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still IN<end_line>
I'm your karma closin in with each stroke of a PEN<end_line>
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin<end_line>
Nope, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly IN<end_line>
When they say all of this is approachin its END<end_line>
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again!<end_line>
Back's to the wall, I'm stackin up all them odds<end_line>
Toilet's clogged, yeah cause I'm talkin a lot of shit but I'm backin it all up<end_line>
But in my head, there's a voice in the back and it hollers<end_line>
after the track is demolished, "I am your lack of a conscience<end_line>
I'm the ringin in your ears, I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils<end_line>
eatin your vocal chords, after your concerts<end_line>
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged<end_line>
Grab for some water but I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow!<end_line>
I'm the bullies you hate, that you became, with every faggot you slaughtered<end_line>
comin back on ya, every woman you insult, batter<end_line>
But the double-standard you have when it comes to your daughters<end_line>
I represent everything, you take for granted<end_line>
Cause Marshall Mathers the rapper's persona's half a fa√ßade and Mathew and Stan's just symbolic<end_line>
of you not knowin what you had 'til it's gone cause<end_line>
after all the glitz and the glam, no more fans that are callin<end_line>
your name, cameras are off, sad but it happens to all of 'em<end_line>
I'm the hindsight to say 'I told you so!' Foreshadows of all the<end_line>
things that are to follow<end_line>
I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow<end_line>
If you don't stop, after they call ya, biggest laughingstock of rap who can't call it quits<end_line>
When it's time to walk away, I'm every guilt trip, the baggage you have<end_line>
but, as you gather up all your possessions, if there's anything you have<end_line>
left to say, 'less it makes an impact then don't bother<end_line>
So 'fore you rest your case, better make sure you're packin a wallop!"<end_line>
So, one last time, I'm back<end_line>
'fore it fades into black and it's all, over<end_line>
Behold the, final chapter in the saga<end_line>
Tryin to recapture that, lightning trapped in a bottle<end_line>
Twice, the magic that started it all, tragic, portrait of an artist tortured<end_line>
Trapped in his own drawings, tap into thoughts<end_line>
Blacker and darker than anything imaginable, here goes a wild stab in the dark<end_line>
Uh, as we pick up where the last "Mathers" left off<end_line>
<verse_end>
