So what do you say to somebody you hate?<end_line>
Or anyone trying to bring trouble your way?<end_line>
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way?<end_line>
Then just study your tape of N.W.A.!<end_line>
One day I was walking by, with a Walkman on<end_line>
When I caught a guy, gave me an awkward eye<end_line>
And strangled him off in the Parking lot, with his Karl KanisÂ©<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Well uhh.. I know you!<end_line>
Aiy fuck you, you stupid Bitch!<end_line>
This is shame on you, this is..<end_line>
Just SHUT the fuck up!<end_line>
What you're doing to my lawn.. that's a shame of you..<end_line>
Fucking bitch, Shut Up<end_line>
I say stop do that to my house, and I ain't embarrass from you<end_line>
Now you and him and your hoodlums, you're ruining my sleep<end_line>
And my baby pie is awaken up because you woke him up<end_line>
You do it always with him, you're miserable guys<end_line>
<verse_end>

Yeah, all I now is I'm upstairs, and I'm listening to my Will Smith CD<end_line>
And I have seen all these flames going everywhere, you know what I'm saying?<end_line>
Hey, hold on a minute, bitch! - Yo, aiy, hold on a minute<end_line>
Yo, Detroit what! - Detroit what! - Detroit baby!<end_line>

And when the cops came through, me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house<end_line>
With a can full of gas and a hand full of matches<end_line>
And still weren't found out<end_line>
From here on out, it's the Chronic two<end_line>
Starting today and tomorrow's the new<end_line>
And I'm still loco enough, to choke you to death with a Charleston Chew<end_line>
Slim shady - hotter then a set of twin babies<end_line>
In a Mercedes Benz with the windows up, when the temp goes up to the mid 80s<end_line>
Calling men ladies; sorry Doc but I been crazy<end_line>
There's no way that you can save me<end_line>
It's okay, go with him Hailey<end_line>
