May I have your attention please?<end_line>
May I have your attention please?<end_line>
Will the real Slim Shady please stand up?<end_line>
I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up?<end_line>
We're gonna have a problem here..<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Y'all act like you never seen a white person before<end_line>
Jaws all on the floor like Pam, like Tommy just burst in the door<end_line>
and started whoopin her ass worse than before<end_line>
they first were divorce, throwin her over furniture<end_line>
It's the return of the... "Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding, <end_line>
he didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"<end_line>
And Dr. Dre said... nothing you idiots! <end_line>
Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement!<end_line>
Feminist women love Eminem {*vocal turntable: <end_line>
chigga chigga chigga*} "Slim Shady, I'm sick of him<end_line>
Look at him, walkin around grabbin his you-know-what<end_line>
Flippin the you-know-who,"  "Yeah, but he's so cute though!"<end_line>
Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose<end_line>
But no worse, than what's goin on in your parents' bedrooms<end_line>
Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't<end_line>
but it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose<end_line>
"My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"<end_line>
And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss<end_line>
And that's the message that we deliver to little kids<end_line>
And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is<end_line>
Of course they gonna know what intercourse is<end_line>
By the time they hit fourth grade<end_line>
They got the Discovery Channel don't they?<end_line>
"We ain't nothing but mammals.." Well, some of us cannibals<end_line>
who cut other people open like cantaloupes<end_line>
But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes<end_line>
then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope<end_line>
But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote<end_line>
Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell his records;<end_line>
well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!<end_line>
You think I give a damn about a Grammy?<end_line>
Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me<end_line>
"But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?"<end_line>
Why?  So you guys could just lie to get me here?<end_line>
So you can, sit me here next to Britney Spears?<end_line>
Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs<end_line>
so I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst<end_line>
and hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first<end_line>
You little bitch, put me on blast on MTV<end_line>
"Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee!"<end_line>
I should download her audio on MP3 <end_line>
and show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD<end_line>
I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me<end_line>
so I have been sent here to destroy you<end_line>
And there's a million of us just like me<end_line>
who cuss like me; who just don't give a fuck like me<end_line>
who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me<end_line>
and just might be the next best thing but not quite me!<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only givin you <end_line>
things you joke about with your friends inside your living room<end_line>
The only difference is I got the balls to say it<end_line>
in front of y'all and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all<end_line>
I just get on the mic and spit it <end_line>
and whether you like to admit itI just shit it<end_line>
better than ninety percent of you rappers out can<end_line>
Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like valiums<end_line>
It's funny; cause at the rate I'm goin when I'm thirty<end_line>
I'll be the only person in the nursin home flirting<end_line>
Pinchin nurses asses when I'm jackin off with Jergens<end_line>
And I'm jerkin but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working<end_line>
And every single person is a Slim Shady lurkin<end_line>
He could be workin at Burger King, spittin on your onion rings<end_line>
Or in the parkin lot, circling<end_line>
Screaming "I don't give a fuck!" <end_line>
with his windows down and his system up<end_line>
So, will the real Shady please stand up?<end_line>
And put one of those fingers on each hand up?<end_line>
And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control<end_line>
and one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Ha ha<end_line>
Guess there's a Slim Shady in all of us<end_line>
Fuck it, let's all stand up<end_line>
<verse_end>
