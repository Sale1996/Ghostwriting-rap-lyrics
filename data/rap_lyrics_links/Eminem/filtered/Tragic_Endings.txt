<verse_start>
All my life I was told, I was never nothin special<end_line>
I don't need to be reminded of it every other second<end_line>
'Specially when all my self-esteem's already shot to hell, I'm fallin helplessly<end_line>
I'm embarrased, I don't want no one else to see<end_line>
Cause I feel like I'm a piece of shit every time she yells at me<end_line>
Selfishly addicted, definitely doesn't help that she<end_line>
makes me feel like I've died and gone to heaven but makes life a livin hell for me<end_line>
She does that thing with her lip, now she's meltin me<end_line>
I'm putty in her palms, I'm wrapped around her finger<end_line>
A yo-yo on a string, she lets me sit there and just dangle<end_line>
until somethin better comes along and she'll just drop me like a hot potato<end_line>
I look like I'm in pain, but I'm okay though<end_line>
Cause I know she loves me Â— my friends, what do they know?<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
In my moments of weakness I openly admit the shit I wouldn't normally<end_line>
I'm extremely self-conscious and enormously<end_line>
insecure and she uses it to torture when she torments me<end_line>
It only turns to ammunition for her, in this war when she<end_line>
gets goin she don't stop, when I'm up she's like a downer<end_line>
When I found her it was love at first encounter<end_line>
Plus somehow she musta took the carton of eggs off the counter<end_line>
Cracked 'em and placed all the shells on the ground for me to walk on when I'm around her<end_line>
But there's just somethin 'bout her that makes me not able to function without her<end_line>
How can I get out of it when I don't know how to?<end_line>
I'm a doubter, I'm a pessimist, make a believer out of me<end_line>
And show me the way now or stay the fuck out of my cloud of rain<end_line>
Cause I'm goin straight down the drain, I'm drownin<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
It took a while for me to get it but I think I've figured it out<end_line>
She don't want me, she just don't wanna see me with someone else<end_line>
The idea of seein me happy destroys her in itself<end_line>
To see me fallin to pieces brings her joy, it brings her hell<end_line>
But it annoys her to see me get this strict and say screw her<end_line>
I threw up on myself, I'm dumb sick, I'm addicted to her<end_line>
She's tryna block the door, so here's how I'll do her<end_line>
Since I'm manure, she's a sewer, this time this piece of shit's runnin through her<end_line>
I can see the light, now I'm runnin to it, what the fuck? Shoulda knew it<end_line>
Who would think she'd actually have the balls to do it?<end_line>
As soon as I hopped in it she doused the car with lighter fluid<end_line>
She's standin there with a rag, 'bout to put the lighter to it<end_line>
Lit the fuckin thing on fire then she threw it<end_line>
<verse_end>
