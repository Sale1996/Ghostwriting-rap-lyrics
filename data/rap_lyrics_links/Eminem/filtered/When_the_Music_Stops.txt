<verse_start>
If I, were to die murdered in cold blood tommorrow<end_line>
Would you feel sorrow or show love, or would it matter?<end_line>
Could never be the lead-off batter<end_line>
if there ain't shit for me to feed off, I'm see-saw battlin<end_line>
But there's way too much at stake for me to be fake<end_line>
There's too much on my plate, I done came way<end_line>
too far in this game to turn and walk away<end_line>
And not say what I got to say<end_line>
What the fuck you take me for a joke? You smokin crack?<end_line>
'Fore I do that, I'd beg Mariah to take me back<end_line>
I'll get up 'fore I get down, run myself in the ground<end_line>
'Fore I put some wack shit out<end_line>
I'm tryin to smack this one out the park, five-thousand mark<end_line>
Y'all steady tryin to drown a shark<end_line>
Ain't gon' do nothin but piss me off, lid to the can of whip-ass<end_line>
Just twist me off, see me leap out, pull a piece out<end_line>
Fuck shootin I'm just tryin to knock his teeth out<end_line>
Fuck with me now bitch, let's see you freestyle<end_line>
Talk is cheap, motherfucker if you really feelin froggish leap<end_line>
Yo Slim, you gon' let him get away with that?<end_line>
He tried to play you, you can't let him skate with that<end_line>
Man I hate this crap<end_line>
This ain't rap, this is crazy the way we act<end_line>
When we confuse hip-hop with real life when the music stops<end_line>
