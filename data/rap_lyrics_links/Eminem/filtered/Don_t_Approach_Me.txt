<verse_start>
.. everyday I wake up, another drama<end_line>
It's a wonder I'm alive, survivin this karma<end_line>
If I can hold on to my private life for five minutes longer<end_line>
I might get my wife to let go of this knife and just calm her<end_line>
without these cameras in our faces like animals<end_line>
for your Channel 2 Action News to follow our ambulence up the avenue<end_line>
and catch a glimpse of all the suicide attempts<end_line>
and what we do in private since they won't let us put up a fence<end_line>
And you wonder why I carry every gun under the sun<end_line>
whether it's unloaded full or an un-registered one<end_line>
No bullet, you're so full of shit<end_line>
this clip is so full it'll spit if I don't pull it<end_line>
And don't give me no bullshit I'm not in the mood<end_line>
I just got in a feud in some parkin lot with a dude<end_line>
over Kim and she just slit both of her wrists over the shit<end_line>
Don't tell me bout the show business shit<end_line>
I know what this is, bitch<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
So do I gotta buy a whole block to myself<end_line>
a front door with twelve locks<end_line>
and have a bodyguard walk me out to my mailbox<end_line>
and everytime somebody makes a threat, run and tell cops?<end_line>
Fuck that, I protect myself with these twelve shots<end_line>
and one in the chamber, gun in the waist<end_line>
and one in the ankle, waitin for someone to come to my place<end_line>
tryin to walk up and knock like these cocksuckers are not<end_line>
gonna get a shotgun or a glock shoved in their face?<end_line>
And it's a disgrace Hailey can't play with her toys<end_line>
in the front yard without you drivin by honkin your horn<end_line>
screamin some shit, leanin out your windows, beepin n shit<end_line>
Or pullin up in my drive like I won't leap in your whip<end_line>
And so these kids tell their friends and relatives where I live<end_line>
so my address ends up on the internet again<end_line>
So then, I do an interview with Spin, tellin them<end_line>
that if someone comes to my crib, I'ma shove a gun in their ribs<end_line>
And reporters, blow it out of proportion<end_line>
"Oh, now he's pullin guns on his fans<end_line>
 just for tryin to stand on his porch"<end_line>
And I'm the bad guy, cause I don't answer my door like "Hey hi!<end_line>
You guys wants some autographs?  Okay, form a straight line!"<end_line>
Sometimes I feel like loadin this rifle<end_line>
and climbin the roof at night and hidin outside to snipe you<end_line>
It's not that I don't like you..<end_line>
.. it's just that I'm not behind the mic<end_line>
I'm a person who's just like you<end_line>
