C'mon Hai-Hai, we goin to the beach<end_line>
Grab a couple of toys and let da-da strap you in the car seat<end_line>
Oh where's mama?  She's takin a little nap in the trunk<end_line>
Oh that smellda-da musta runned over a skunk<end_line>
Now I know what you're thinkin - it's kind of late to go swimmin<end_line>
But you know your mama, she's one of those type of women<end_line>
that do crazy things, and if she don't get her way, she'll throw a fit<end_line>
Don't play with da-da's toy knife, honey, let go of it<end_line>
And don't look so upset, why you actin bashful?<end_line>
Don't you wanna help da-da build a sand castle?<end_line>
And mama said she wants to show how far she can float<end_line>
And don't worry about that little boo-boo on her throat<end_line>
It's just a little scratch - it don't hurt, her was eatin<end_line>
dinner while you were sweepin and spilled ketchup on her shirt<end_line>
Mama's messy isn't she?  We'll let her wash off in the water<end_line>
and me and you can pway by ourselves, can't we?<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
See honey.. there's a place called heaven and a place called hell<end_line>
A place called prison and a place called jail<end_line>
And da-da's probably on his way to all of em except one<end_line>
Cause mama's got a new husband and a stepson<end_line>
And you don't want a brother do ya? <end_line>
Maybe when you're old enough to understand a little better<end_line>
I'll explain it to ya<end_line>
But for now we'll just say mama was real real bad<end_line>
She was bein mean to dad and made him real real mad<end_line>
But I still feel sad that I put her on time-out<end_line>
Sit back in your chair honey, quit tryin to climb out<end_line>
I told you it's okay HaiHai, wanna ba-ba? <end_line>
Take a night-night?  Nan-a-boo, goo-goo ga-ga?<end_line>
Her make goo-goo ca-ca?  Da-da change your dia-dee<end_line>
Clean the baby up so her can take a nighty-nighty<end_line>
Your dad'll wake her up as soon as we get to the water<end_line>
Ninety-seven Bonnie and Clyde, me and my daughter<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Wake up sweepy head we're here, before we pway<end_line>
we're gonna take mama for a wittle walk along the pier<end_line>
Baby, don't cry honey, don't get the wrong idea<end_line>
Mama's too sweepy to hear you screamin in her ear<end_line>
That's why you can't get her to wake, but don't worry<end_line>
Da-da made a nice bed for mommy at the bottom of the lake<end_line>
Here, you wanna help da-da tie a rope around this rock? <end_line>
We'll tie it to her footsie then we'll roll her off the dock<end_line>
Ready now, here we go, on the count of free..<end_line>
One.. two.. free.. WHEEEEEE! <end_line>
There goes mama, spwashin in the wa-ta<end_line>
No more fightin wit dad, no more restraining order<end_line>
No more step-da-da, no more new brother<end_line>
Blow her kisses bye-bye, tell mama you love her<end_line>
Now we'll go play in the sand, build a castle and junk<end_line>
But first, just help dad with two more things out the trunk<end_line>
<verse_end>
