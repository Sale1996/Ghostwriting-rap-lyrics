<verse_start>
Lately, I really<end_line>
Feel like I'm, roll'n for delph like Philly<end_line>
Feel like I'm lose'n control of myself<end_line>
I sincerely, apologize if all that I sound like<end_line>
Is I'm complaining, but life keeps on complicating<end_line>
And, I'm debating on, leaving this world this evening<end_line>
Even my girls can see that I'm grieving<end_line>
I try and hide it but I can't<end_line>
Why do I act like I am all high and mighty<end_line>
When inside I'm dying, I am finally realize'n I need...help<end_line>
Can't do it myself, too weak<end_line>
Two weeks I've been having ups and down<end_line>
Going through peaks and valleys<end_line>
Dilly dallying, around with the idea<end_line>
Of ending this shit right here<end_line>
I'm hating my reflection<end_line>
I walk around the house trying to fight mirrors<end_line>
I can't stand what I look like, yeah<end_line>
I look fat, but what do I care<end_line>
I give a fuck, only thing that I fear is Hailey<end_line>
I'm afraid that if I close my eyes then I might see her...Shit<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I lock myself in the bedroom, bathroom<end_line>
Napping at noon, yeah dad's in a bad mood<end_line>
He's always snapping at you<end_line>
Marshall what happened that you<end_line>
Can't stop with these pills, and you've falling off with your skills<end_line>
And your own fans are laughing at you<end_line>
It become a problem you're too pussy to tackle<end_line>
Get up, be a man, stand, a real man woulda had this shit handled<end_line>
Know you just had your heart, ripped out and crushed<end_line>
They say Proof just flipped out, homie just whipped out and bust<end_line>
Nah, it ain't like Doody to do that,<end_line>
He wouldn't fuck'n shoot at...nobody, he'd fight first<end_line>
But dwelling on it only makes the night worse<end_line>
Now I'm popping Vikes, Percs, and Methadone Pills<end_line>
Yeah Em tight verse, you killed it<end_line>
Fuck'n drug dealers hang around me like Yes-Men<end_line>
And they gon' do whatever I says, whenever I says it<end_line>
It's in their best interest to protect their investment<end_line>
And I just lost my fuck'n best friend, so fuck it I guess then<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
My friends can't understand this new me<end_line>
That's understandable man, but think how bananas you'd be<end_line>
You'd be an animal too<end_line>
If you were trapped in this fame, and caged in it like a zoo<end_line>
And everybody's look'n at you<end_line>
Whacha want me to do?<end_line>
I'm starting to live like a recluse, and the truth is<end_line>
Fame is starting to give me an excuse<end_line>
To be at a, all-time low<end_line>
I sit alone in my home theatre, watching the same damn DVD of the<end_line>
First tour, the last tour, he was still alive<end_line>
And it hurts, so I fast forward<end_line>
Sleeping pills would make me feel alright<end_line>
And if I'm still awake in the middle of the night<end_line>
I just take a couple more, yeah you're motherfucking right<end_line>
I ain't slowing down for no one<end_line>
I am almost homeward bound<end_line>
Almost in a coma, yeah homie, come on dole Â‘em out<end_line>
Daddy don't you die on me<end_line>
Daddy better hold your ground<end_line>
Fuck, don't I know the sound of that voice<end_line>
Yeah baby hold me down<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Wake up in the hospital, full of tubes<end_line>
Plus somehow I'm pulling through<end_line>
Swear when I come back, I'ma be bullet proof<end_line>
I'ma do it just for proof<end_line>
I think I should state a few<end_line>
Facts, cuz I may not get a chance again to say the truth<end_line>
See it just hit me, that what if I would not have made it through<end_line>
I think about the things that I would have never got say to you<end_line>
I'd never get to make it right, so here's what I came to do<end_line>
Hailey this one is for you, Whitney and Alaina too<end_line>
I still love your mother, that'll never change<end_line>
Think about her every day, we just could never get it together hey<end_line>
Wish there was a better way for me to say it<end_line>
But I swear on everything, I'll do anything for her on any day<end_line>
There are just too many things, to explain<end_line>
When it rains, guess it pours, guess it does<end_line>
Wish there wasn't any pain<end_line>
But I can't pretend there ain't<end_line>
I ain't placing any blame, I ain't pointing fingers<end_line>
Heaven knows I've never been a saint<end_line>
I know that it feels like we just pissed away our history<end_line>
And just today, I looked at your picture, almost as if to say<end_line>
I miss you sub-consciously, wish it didn't end this way<end_line>
But I just had to get away, don't know why, I don't know what else to say<end_line>
I guess I'm<end_line>
<verse_end>
