<verse_start>
Some days I just wanna up and call it quits<end_line>
I feel like I'm surrounded by a wall of bricks<end_line>
Every time I go to get up I just fall in pits<end_line>
My life's like one great big ball of shit<end_line>
If I could just, put it all into all I spit<end_line>
Instead of always tryin to swallow it<end_line>
Instead of starin at this wall and shit<end_line>
While I sit writer's block, sick of all this shit<end_line>
Can't call it, shit<end_line>
All I know is I'm about to hit the wall<end_line>
if I have to see another one of mom's alcholic fits<end_line>
This is it, last straw, that's all, that's it<end_line>
I ain't dealin with another fuckin politic<end_line>
I'm like a skillet bubblin until it filters up<end_line>
I'm about to kill it, I can feel it buildin up<end_line>
Blow this building up, I've concealed enough<end_line>
My cup, runneth over, I done filled it up<end_line>
The pen explodes and busts, ink spills my guts<end_line>
You think, all I do is stand here and feel my nuts?<end_line>
Well I'ma show you what, you gon' feel my rush<end_line>
You don't feel it, then it must be too real to touch<end_line>
Peal the dutch, I'm about to tear shit up<end_line>
Goosebumps yea, I'ma make your hair sit up<end_line>
Yea sit up, I'ma tell you who I be<end_line>
I'ma make you hate me, cause you ain't me<end_line>
You wait, it ain't too late to finally see<end_line>
what you closed-minded fucks were too blind to see<end_line>
Whoever finds me is gonna get a finder's fee<end_line>
out this world, ain't no one out there mind as me<end_line>
You need piece of mind? Here's a piece of mine<end_line>
All I need's a line<end_line>
But sometimes I don't always find the words to rhyme<end_line>
to express how I'm really feelin at that time<end_line>
Yea sometimes sometimes sometimes<end_line>
It's just sometimes, it's always me<end_line>
How dark can these hallways be?<end_line>
The clock strikes midnight, one-two, then half past three<end_line>
This half-assed rhyme with this half-assed piece of paper<end_line>
I'm desperate at my desk<end_line>
If I can just get the rest of the shit off my chest again<end_line>
Stuck in a slump, can't think of nothin<end_line>
Fuck I'm stumped, but wait, here comes somethin<end_line>
Nope, it's not good enough, scribble it out<end_line>
New pad, crinkle it up, and throw the shit out<end_line>
I'm fizzlin now, thought I figured it out<end_line>
Ball's in my court, but I'm scared to dribble it out<end_line>
I'm afraid, but why am I afraid?<end_line>
Why am I a slave to this trade?<end_line>
Signed out of spit to the grave<end_line>
Real enough to rile you up<end_line>
Want me to flip it I can rip it any style you want<end_line>
I'm a switch hitter bitch, Jimmy Smits ain't a quitter<end_line>
I'ma sit until I get enough in me to finally hit a<end_line>
fuckin boilin point, put some oil in your joints<end_line>
Flip the coin bitch, come get destroyed<end_line>
An MC's worst dream, I make 'em tense<end_line>
They hate me, see me and shake like a chainlink fence<end_line>
By the looks of 'em, you would swear their jaws was comin<end_line>
By the screams of 'em, you would swear I'm sawin someone<end_line>
By the way they're runnin, you would swear the law was comin<end_line>
It's now or never and tonight is all or nothin<end_line>
Momma Jimmy keeps leavin on us, he said he'd be back<end_line>
He pinky promised, I don't think he's honest<end_line>
I'll be back baby, I just gotta beat this clock<end_line>
Fuck this clock, I'ma make 'em eat this watch<end_line>
Don't believe me watch, I'ma win this race<end_line>
And I'ma come back and rub my shit in your face, bitch<end_line>
I found my nitch, you gon' hear my voice<end_line>
'Til you sick of it, you ain't gonna have a choice<end_line>
If I gotta scream 'til I have half a lung<end_line>
If I had half a chance I'd grab it - Rabbit, run<end_line>
<verse_end>
