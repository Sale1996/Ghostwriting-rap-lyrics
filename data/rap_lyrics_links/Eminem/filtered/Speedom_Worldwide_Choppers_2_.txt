Wait! Before I wreck this beat, let me just check to see<end_line>
if Stephanie Mills left any extra refills<end_line>
of ecstacy pills next to me in the seats spilled<end_line>
or she eat 'em all with a breakfast drink<end_line>
I'm in the habit of grabbin a mic and babblin, I dabble in Vic's<end_line>
But I might just swallow my fuckin Ritalin tablet after tonight<end_line>
I'm grabbin it right from the medicine cabinet cause that's what it's like<end_line>
and attackin it like a Dracula bite, jetpack in a backpack when I write<end_line>
All this anger pent up inside, I went up inside a Bennigans diner<end_line>
with a cigarette lighter, figured I'd try to set a big enough fire<end_line>
that'll trigger the sprinkler system and I'd escape but the getaway driver<end_line>
screwed up my limo, collided<end_line>
with the center divider, I went through the window and ended<end_line>
up bein pinned to the side of a semi fended<end_line>
beside a friend of the guy's wife Brenda<end_line>
The flight attendant from Idaho that took an antenna in the vagina<end_line>
Cause when I pick up a pen I'm venomous and I'm as slick as Dennis the Menace<end_line>
like an evil dental hygienist and sinister<end_line>
You've been yellin dementedness, I invented this<end_line>
I'm the genesis, Eminem is a nemesis to a feminist<end_line>
Fuckin smart alec degenerate, I got Ellen DeGeneres<end_line>
tryna tell me these men are just full of jealousy, envious<end_line>
of female independence, hell with a clitoris, hit or miss<end_line>
You will never consider this a bitter disappointment, I'll never fail to deliver this<end_line>
Whatever the weather in this'll be<end_line>
Just like a certificate of authenticity - but I'm thinkin about<end_line>
Just tryna think of the quickest and sickest way to make 'em picket, I pick a day<end_line>
to be a prick then I'm pickin the wickedest shit to say<end_line>
Spit it back on a level, incredible, head full of Red Bull, unforgettable<end_line>
Better believe these beats are edible and I consider loose leaf a vegetable<end_line>
And I stalk my prey<end_line>
You think you got away, uh-uh, not today<end_line>
Murder you on a song and then I'll just say<end_line>
I was with Dr. Dre and Robert Blake eatin lobster, steak<end_line>
and coffee cake at a restaurant with Drake<end_line>
and Tech, just got to make sure that our stories corroborate<end_line>
I'm a lot to take<end_line>
Like Kanye walkin up on the stage for Beyonc√© like it's my job to say<end_line>
that you're not a real artist, but it's my obliga-<end_line>
-tion, Honest Abe is on his way, you will not escape!<end_line>
Ammunition replenished, the Punisher with his gun insured<end_line>
Hundred words and a clip, other words motherfuckers better run<end_line>
If you're not lookin to get run over by the roadrunner<end_line>
No wonder no one don't wanna go and jump in front of<end_line>
a fuckin runaway locomotive or get thrown up under it<end_line>
Just tryna fuck with the<end_line>
<verse_end>
