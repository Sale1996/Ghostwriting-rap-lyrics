<verse_start>
You find me offensive; I find you offensive for finding me offensive<end_line>
Hence if I should draw out or line any fences; if so<end_line>
to what extents if any should I go?  Cause it's getting expensive <end_line>
Being on the other side of the courtroom on the defensive<end_line>
They say I cause extensive psychological nerve damage<end_line>
to the brain when I go to lengths; this<end_line>
far at other people's expenses<end_line>
I say you're all just too God damned sensitive<end_line>
It's censorship and it's downright blasphemous<end_line>
Let's end this shit now cause I won't stand for this<end_line>
And Christo-pher Reeves won't sit for this neither<end_line>
And let's clear this up too I ain't got no beef with him either<end_line>
He used to be like a hero to me I even believe I<end_line>
had one of those 25 cent stickers on my refrigerator<end_line>
Right next to Darth Vader<end_line>
And Darth must of put a hex on him for later<end_line>
I feel like it's my fault cause of the way that<end_line>
I stuck him up in between him and Lex Luthor<end_line>
I killed Superman I killed Super-man, and how ironic<end_line>
That I'd be the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic<end_line>

Now in the bible it says<end_line>
Thou shalt not watch two lesbians in bed, have homosexual sex<end_line>
Unless of course you were given the consent to join in<end_line>
Then of course it's intercourse and it's bisexual sex<end_line>
Which isn't as bad, as long as you show some remorse<end_line>
for your actions; either before during or after<end_line>
Performing the act of that which<end_line>
Is normally referred to as such more commonly known phrases<end_line>
That are more used by today's kids, in a more derogatory way<end_line>
But who's to say, what's fair to say<end_line>
And what not to say, let's ask Dr. Dre<end_line>
Dr. DreI got a question if I may<end_line>
Is it gay to play putt-putt golf with a friend<end_line>
And watch his butt butt when he tees off<end_line>
But uh, I ain't done yet<end_line>
In football the quarterback yells out hut hut<end_line>
While he reaches in another grown man's ass<end_line>
Grabs on his nuts but just what if<end_line>
It was never meant, it was just an accident<end_line>
But he tripped fell slipped and his penis went in<end_line>
His teeny tiny little round hiney and he didn't mean it<end_line>
But his little weenie flinched just a little bit<end_line>
And I don't need to go into any more details but<end_line>
What if he pictured it as a female's butt<end_line>
Is that gay?  I just need to clear things up<end_line>
'Til then I'll just walk around with a manly strut, because<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
You find me offensive, I find you offensive<end_line>
Shit this is the same verse, I just did this<end_line>
When am I gonna come to my good senses<end_line>
Probably the day Bush comes to my defenses<end_line>
My spider sense is tellin me Spider-Man is nearby<end_line>
And my plan is to get him next<end_line>
And open up a whoop ass canister<end_line>
God damnit Dre, where's the God damned beat<end_line>
Anyway, anyway I don't know how else to put it<end_line>
This is the only thing that I'm good at<end_line>
I am the bad guy, kryptonite, the green chronic<end_line>
Demonic, yup yup, don't worry I'm on it<end_line>
I got it, high five Nick Lachey<end_line>
Stuck a pin in Jessica's ass and walked away<end_line>
And as she flew around the room like a balloon I<end_line>
Grabbed the last can of chicken tuna out the trash can and zoom I <end_line>
Headed straight back to the Neverland Ranch<end_line>
With a peanut butter jelly chicken tuna sandwich<end_line>
And I don't even gotta make no God damned sense<end_line>
I just did a whole song and I didn't say shit!<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Cause AHH-AHH-AHH-AHH-AHH!<end_line>
Yup, Rain Man<end_line>
Definitely, definitely Dr. Dre<end_line>
Super dope, beatmaker<end_line>
Two thousand, two thousand four-hundred and eighty-seven million<end_line>
Nine hundred and se-seventy-three thousand four hundred and sixty-three..<end_line>
