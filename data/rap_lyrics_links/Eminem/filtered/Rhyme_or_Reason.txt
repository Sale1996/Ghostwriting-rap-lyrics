<verse_start>
I don't have one<end_line>
My mother reproduced like the komodo dragon<end_line>
And had me on the back of a motorcycle then crashed in<end_line>
the side of a locomotive with rap, I'm<end_line>
loco, it's like handin a psycho a loaded handgun<end_line>
Michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum<end_line>
'bout to explode all over the canvas<end_line>
Back with the Yoda of rap "in a spasm<end_line>
Your music usually has 'em<end_line>
But waned for the game your enthusiasm it hasn't<end_line>
Follow you must, Rick Rubin my little Padawan"<end_line>
A Jedi in trainin<end_line>
Colossal brain and, thoughts of entertainin<end_line>
But docile and impossible to explain and, I'm also vain and<end_line>
probably find a way to complain about a Picasso paintin<end_line>
Puke Skywalker, but sound like Chewbacca when I talk<end_line>
Full of such blind rage, I need a seein eye dog<end_line>
Can't even find the page I was writin this rhyme on<end_line>
Oh, it's on the ram-page, couldn't see what I wrote, I write small<end_line>
It says "Ever since I drove a '79 Lincoln with white walls, had a fire in my heart<end_line>
and a dire desire to aspire to DIE HARD!"<end_line>
So as long as I'm on the clock punchin this time card<end_line>
hip-hop ain't dyin on my watch<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
NO! If he had<end_line>
He wouldn't have ended up in these rhymes on my pad<end_line>
I wouldn't be so mad, my attitude wouldn't be so bad<end_line>
Yeah, dad~!<end_line>
I'm, the epitome and the prime example<end_line>
of what happens when the power of the rhyme falls into the wrong hands and<end_line>
makes you wanna get up and start dancin<end_line>
even if it is Charles Manson<end_line>
who just happens to be rappin, blue lights flashin<end_line>
Laughin all the way to the bank, lamping in my K-Mart mansion<end_line>
I'm in the style department<end_line>
with a pile in my cart, rippin the aisle apart but<end_line>
With great power comes absolutely no responsiblity for content<end_line>
Completely despondent and condescending<end_line>
The king of nonsense and controversy is on a<end_line>
beat-killin spree, Your Honor, I must<end_line>
plead guilty, cause I sparked the<end_line>
revolution, rebel without a cause who caused the evolution<end_line>
of rap, to take it to the next level, boost it<end_line>
But several rebuked it, and whoever produced it<end_line>
Does that mean, it belongs to me<end_line>
cause I just happen to be<end_line>
a white honkey devil with two horns that don't honk<end_line>
but every time I speak, you hear a beep?<end_line>
But lyrically I never hear a peep, not even a whisper<end_line>
Rappers better stay clear of me bitch, cause it's the<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
So yeah dad, let's WALK<end_line>
Let's have us a father and son TALK<end_line>
But I bet we wouldn't probably get one BLOCK<end_line>
without me knockin your block OFF, this is all your FAULT!<end_line>
Maybe that's why<end_line>
I'm so bananas, I ap-peeled to all those walks of life<end_line>
whoever had strife<end_line>
Maybe that's what dad and son talks are like<end_line>
Cause I, related to the struggles<end_line>
of young America when their fuckin parents were unaware of their troubles<end_line>
Now they're rippin out their fuckin hair again, it's hyster-ical<end_line>
I chuckle, as everybody bloodies their bare knuckles<end_line>
Yeah, uh-oh, better beware knuckle-<end_line>
-heads, the sign on my hustle<end_line>
says don't knock, the door's broken, it won't lock<end_line>
It might just fly open, get cold-cocked<end_line>
You critics come to pay me a visit?<end_line>
Misery loves company, please stay a minute<end_line>
Kryptonite to a hypocrite, zip your lip<end_line>
If you dish it but can't take it, too busy gettin<end_line>
stoned in your glass house<end_line>
to kick rocks, then you wonder why I lash out<end_line>
Mr. Mathers as advertised on the flyers<end_line>
so spread the word cause I'm promotin my passion 'til I'm passed out<end_line>
Completely brain-dead, Rain Man<end_line>
doin the Bankhead in a restraint chair!<end_line>
So bitch, shoot me a look, it better be a blank stare<end_line>
Or get shanked in the pancreas, I'm angrier<end_line>
than all eight other reindeer<end_line>
put together with Chief Keef cause I hate every fuckin thing, yeah!<end_line>
Even this rhyme bitch<end_line>
And quit tryin to look for a fuckin reason for it that ain't there<end_line>
And I still am a CRIMINAL!<end_line>
10 year-old degenerate grabbin on my GENITALS!<end_line>
The last Mathers LP done went diamond<end_line>
This time I'm predictin that this one'll go EMERALD!<end_line>
Ha, when will the madness end?<end_line>
How can it when there's no method to the pad and pen?<end_line>
The only message that I have to send<end_line>
is dad, I'm back at it again<end_line>
<verse_end>
