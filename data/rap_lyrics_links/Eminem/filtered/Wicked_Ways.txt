Guess I got a way with words, I could get away with murder, ever heard of Aspergers? It's a rare condition<end_line>
It's what you're sufferin from when you simply don't care if it's an<end_line>
80-degree day and there's no fricken air conditionin and you can't see the bitch's hair is frizzin<end_line>
Cause you got the windows up blarin the system in your Chevrolet Prism<end_line>
The devil ain't on the level same as him, picture someone who revels in straight masochism<end_line>
And imagine him givin him an adjective an ass whippin so bad they should put his ass in prison<end_line>
A word bully, I verbally abuse verbs like they did somethin to me personally<end_line>
Used to get bullied so I cut class and ditch it - now I bully rap, I'm the shit, bag it<end_line>
Cadillac from a K-car, my ass from a hole in the ground, still can't tell 'em a-part<end_line>
Came straight out the trailer park screamin I'm proud to shop at K-Mart and it became art<end_line>
And I'm still fed up and as pissed off as they are<end_line>
To this day I still get in fights with the same broad at the same Walmart arguin over the same cart<end_line>
in the middle of the aisle whylin, I don't give a fuck, I don't play!<end_line>
Bitch you think you saw this basket first? Your ass backwards like motherfuckin Bob and Silent Jay!<end_line>
Illest shit you could think I would say, mind's like a pile of clay<end_line>
When's the last time that you saw a villain with a cape?<end_line>
Ripped a gapin hole in it, flipped out, ripped down the drapes<end_line>
Tied 'em around my neck, went down the fire escape of the Empire State<end_line>
Slipped fell straight down to the ground splattered all over the entire state<end_line>
And straight to hell got an impaled by the gates, so Satan stuck his face in an ashtray<end_line>
while I sashayed around flames with a match and I gave him the gas face<end_line>
And this ain't got nothin to do with a scale of bein gay little faggot, but by the way<end_line>
Thoughts are gettin darker by the day<end_line>
I'm a combination of Skylar Grey, Tyler the Creator and Violent Jay<end_line>
It's a fuckin miracle to be this lyrical, paint my face with clown makeup and a smiley face<end_line>
I'm insane, every rhyme I say, sons/suns you like an ultraviolet ray<end_line>
I'm sellin hatred buffet style, all the shit you can eat, $11.99 so come on and pile a plate<end_line>
I'm throwin down the gauntlet to see what hell I can raise with the rhyme I'm spittin<end_line>
while I'm shittin on competition, in the meantime it's always mean time, I'm gettin<end_line>

I've been a career asshole, I don't see why these people always got my back<end_line>
I done said so much fucked-up shit, I was born a mistake but I was put here not by ac-<end_line>
-cident, I had a purpose and that purpose was to beat a beat purplish, slaughter tracks<end_line>
I done put my two dimes and a nickel in this shit, I'm comin to get that quarter-back<end_line>
like Ndamukong, the drama can build, your momma can ask me for my autograph<end_line>
Cause that cougar's a MILF, she's the oldest trick in the book but I sure would fall for THAT<end_line>
You done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight, when I get on the mic I'ma SNAP<end_line>
Make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital when I overdosed woulda caught a FLAT<end_line>
If it makes you sick to your stomach acid, indigestion, my suggestion's Kaopectate<end_line>
If it feels like I'm runnin away with the game it's cause I am, don't speculate, spectate<end_line>
All I got is dick for days and insults for decades<end_line>
But I get by with my wicked ways, lady you can suck a dick 'til your neck aches<end_line>
Cry 'til you get puffy eyes, red face, but I'm leavin on this jet plane<end_line>
You ain't fly, you're an airhead and I'm sick of poundin a square peg in a round hole, sorry another catchphrase<end_line>
But your baggage ain't gonna fit in my storage overhead space<end_line>
Cause you just ain't big enough to fit your damaged goods, other words don't try to put your heart in a headcase<end_line>
Cause baby, stable mentally I ain't<end_line>
I need my meds, I peed my bed, I'm goin blind, I don't see my legs<end_line>
I keep on fallin down, no wonder you can't stand me, I need my cane<end_line>
Someone help me, I think my face is melting, if you felt these migraines<end_line>
And see these maggots eat my brain, this G-I-A-<end_line>
-N-T hole in my empty head, if you read my mind you can see my pain<end_line>
Then you'd see why I be this way, ever since I was knee-high playin<end_line>
with G.I. Joes, told these hoes shut their P-I-E holes, now peep my game<end_line>
Cause I'm 'bout itlike afuckinecho<end_line>
Psy-psycho on a cyclone cycle spiraling, h-h-here I go, I`m outta control like no<end_line>
o-o-o-other mic go, stab you 'til the knife goes<end_line>
d-d-dull, I'm nothin but a hole inside your skull where your eye goes<end_line>
Cause I'ma sock it/socket to you! Dyke hoe<end_line>
You don't like it, get on your Harley Davidson menstrual cycle and ride it, like a motorbike<end_line>
I'm finna blow the mic the whole night so strike up the fuckin maestro, I'm nitro<end_line>
And hi-ho, hand me my shovel, I'm liable to dig my hole<end_line>
deeper and it's off to H-E-double hockey sticks I go<end_line>
I'm gettin<end_line>
