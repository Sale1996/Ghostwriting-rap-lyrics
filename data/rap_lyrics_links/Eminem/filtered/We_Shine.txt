<verse_start>
I'm rockin shit, packin shit, while stackin shit<end_line>
If anyone steps up askin shit, I'm blastin shit<end_line>
You gone phase me, but swingin like Peter Parker<end_line>
Motherfuck the shop, I'll wreck the Goddamn barber<end_line>
Forget your dreams about being with fans hugged up<end_line>
You couldn't be a dope MC if you said his rhymes drugged up<end_line>
I told you once, but you forget so here's a flashback<end_line>
"You couldn't be shit, if you came out my asscrack"<end_line>
Stop frontin kid, you know you ain't paid<end_line>
And the only mic/Mike you wrecked was that kid you fought in first grade<end_line>
Ain't nothin lyrical about you but your lies<end_line>
So cut the shit, cause its startin to draw flies<end_line>
You're played like my five-year old's newborn toys<end_line>
Don't know shit about Chicago, but I could still make Illa Noyz<end_line>
Like Robin Leech I display stylish ways<end_line>
Thats rough like my face when I haven't shaved in days<end_line>
Listen up, all these words take heed<end_line>
When I cock and squeeze, no more MC's breathe<end_line>
I'm sick of this, here's my final diss<end_line>
Fuck you dumb niggaz you ain't shit like piss<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
My Smith and Wessy got you layin in some alley messy<end_line>
Got your family lookin for your ass on Sally Jesse<end_line>
We squash beef in the mo', when you ain't breathin no more<end_line>
Leavin your skull split like Steven Seagal<end_line>
Let the cat out, flat out, Detroit's a mad house<end_line>
So I don't get offended when I hear my city badmouthed<end_line>
We quick to pull the gat out and set it<end_line>
And leave you with more shit missin than a Lil' Kim radio edit<end_line>
Stick up kids be tryin to live paid<end_line>
You get your grill sprayed with twenty-seven bullets in your ribcage<end_line>
Get the guage, cock it back, empty your pockets, Jack<end_line>
Or I'ma send you flyin like a rocketpack<end_line>
Murder you for a bag of chips and a chocolate snack<end_line>
Break into your crib still your shit and lock it back<end_line>
Ten-year old kids be standin on the block with gats<end_line>
Just for livin nowadays'll get you flocked with bats<end_line>
Where I'm from...yaknow what'm sayin?, that's some old Detroit shit<end_line>
y'all wouldn't know about that shit, though. Less you come<end_line>
to my city, ya know what'm sayin? See where we live, <end_line>
cause we shine<end_line>
