I'm a mad dog nigga, Cujo<end_line>
So the +Dee+ watch me now like I'm Kool Moe<end_line>
I'm overseas turnin weed into euro<end_line>
Now I'm back to +Draw Four+ like Uno<end_line>
FUCK your girl roll, I never stop gettin it<end_line>
I keep runnin like your toilet need jigglin<end_line>
You're loud but your mouth don't match the dividends<end_line>
Your rock hard flow sound a lil' impotent<end_line>
I only got sixteen, but my sixteen<end_line>
like sixteen kids shot my six teens<end_line>
Trenchcoat, I empty 'til the clip clean<end_line>
A one-shot like Tyson hit Mitch Green<end_line>
Ask my siblings, I got a problem<end_line>
Your punchlines won't make it out of Round ONE!<end_line>
Birds, love to flaunt all around him<end_line>
You want a bad boy? You found one<end_line>
Get money!<end_line>
