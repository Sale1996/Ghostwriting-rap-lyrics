<verse_start>
It's sick but who could ever predict, we'd be doin the same shit<end_line>
We say we do it for our baby but we don't<end_line>
We do it for us, it's lust, cause neither one of us trust each other<end_line>
So we fuck 'til we bust and we cuss each other, out<end_line>
We know what it's about, SHOUT<end_line>
'til I throw you out the house, you throw me out the house<end_line>
I throw you on the couch, punch you in the mouth<end_line>
Fistfight 'til we turn this mother out<end_line>
Then apologize after, laughter, pain<end_line>
It's insane we're back in the same chapter again<end_line>
And it's sad but it's true, when I'm layin here with you<end_line>
There ain't nothin anyone could ever say or ever do cause<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Cause I hate you, do you hate me?<end_line>
Good - cause you're so fuckin beautiful when you're angry<end_line>
It makes me, wanna just take you and just throw you<end_line>
on the bed and fuck you like I don't even know you<end_line>
You fuck other people and I fuck other people<end_line>
You're a slut, but I'm equal, I'm a mutt, we're both evil<end_line>
in our ways but neither one of us would ever admit it<end_line>
Cause one us would have one up on the other so forget it<end_line>
We can make accusations, people spred rumors<end_line>
But they ain't got proof, if they do it's just the two of us<end_line>
It's you and me, cause any chick can say that she screwin me<end_line>
But you gotta believe me to a degree cause true indeed<end_line>
if you didn't I wouldn't be hittin.. yeah I would<end_line>
Cause the sex is too damn good, if I ran who would I run to<end_line>
that would be this soft and warm<end_line>
So it's off and on, usually more off than on<end_line>
But at least we know, that we share this common bond<end_line>
You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on<end_line>
I hope, the only reason that I cope is cause of that fact<end_line>
And plus I can bust in that and that's why<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I can never understand it, that's why I don't try<end_line>
From junior high until we both die, it's silly<end_line>
Oh why must we try, is it really so rough<end_line>
that we must always call each other's Billy Goat's Gruff?<end_line>
Try to pull each other's legs, until the other begs<end_line>
We're lyin to ourselves, that's the beauty of it geah<end_line>
Cause we truly love each other, that's why we always fightin<end_line>
All we do is shove each other every other fuckin night<end_line>
And it's clear it ain't gonna change, it's pent up rage<end_line>
we both had, we both feel like we've been upstaged<end_line>
by someone else, we've both been with someone else<end_line>
And someone else's problems neither one wants help<end_line>
It's an addiction and it can't be fixed<end_line>
Our family's mixed up, there's a baby sister in the mix<end_line>
And it hurts cause the pieces to the puzzle don't fit<end_line>
And anybody who thinks they know us doesn't know shit<end_line>
And they're probably just tired of hearin it all the time<end_line>
On every song, every lyric and every rhyme<end_line>
All the hoop-la, all the whoopty-woo<end_line>
What you put me through, fuckin whoopty-do<end_line>
But I won't be made a fool of, if this is true love<end_line>
you wouldn't do what, you did last time, you wouldn't screw up<end_line>
this time, cause this time girl I'm tellin you what<end_line>
You do it again I'm fuckin you up<end_line>
<verse_end>
