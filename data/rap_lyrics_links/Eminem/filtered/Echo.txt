<verse_start>
Sometimes no matter what I do<end_line>
Just can't get away from it<end_line>
The voices<end_line>
I can hear 'em calling calling calling calling calling me<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I EAT rappers, with the rhyme, consume 'em<end_line>
The only fuckin thing that you consume is time, I'm super human<end_line>
My world is like a Rubik's Cube, it's too complex, girl you assumin<end_line>
Cupid's loomin, my mentality's caveman, stupid woman<end_line>
My life is Truman Show, all I have is music hoe<end_line>
I stopped chasin every chick under the sun many moons ago <end_line>
so pretend my dick is a balloon and blow<end_line>
But you better put a fork in it if you think I'ma lay here just spoonin yo<end_line>
Oh you think you the shit cause I just said you was BEAUTIFUL?!<end_line>
Diabolical to my last molecule down to my last hair follicle and cuticle<end_line>
Rotten to the core to the bone cold all the way down to my soul from my head to my toe<end_line>
Ever since I was 13 I learned how to sew and sewed shut my own booty hole<end_line>
Cause ain't I took no shit since I looked down to my nuts and saw my first pubic grow<end_line>
I told these stupid hoes when I come back I'ma set this bitch on FIRE<end_line>
And this time I don't mean I'ma pour gasoline on some chick and light her<end_line>
Cause this time when I fuck this world I'ma put the whole Goddamn dick inside her<end_line>
I ain't even put my tip in that hole yet, I'ma go get Nickel and try to rip it wider<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Shh! Wait, did you hear that?<end_line>
Somebody just said somethin<end_line>
Is anybody there?<end_line>
<verse_end>
