What up?<end_line>
Hello? Yo, I can't, I can't hear you<end_line>
Let me call you back<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I sense someone's tapping into my phones, why do<end_line>
I got this feeling in my bones I might die soon<end_line>
The FBI might be trying to pull my file soon<end_line>
I might be walking blindfold into a typhoon<end_line>
I might be seeing rockets light up the night sky<end_line>
Right outside the window of my living room<end_line>
And if they do you can say good night and by-bye to them iTunes<end_line>
If I don't try to record as much before I do<end_line>
The plan is to have as many in the can as I can<end_line>
As I stand before you in this booth of walking dead man<end_line>
Blank stair, dead pan, look on my face as I gaze into space<end_line>
As I wait to be scooped up in that van<end_line>
As I mysteriously disappear into thin air<end_line>
And they gonna say a sniper just appeared out of nowhere<end_line>
And I'll go down in the history<end_line>
As the bloodsucking leech who hid behind the freedom of speech<end_line>
Tried to take the 5th Amendment, use it, twist it and bend it<end_line>
And ended up dying the villian, not the hero<end_line>
Splendid, stupendous way to end this, I can feel the tremors tremendous<end_line>
In remembrance of September 11th<end_line>
Flash back to September 7th when 2Pac was murdered in Vegas<end_line>
He said it, he predicted his own death, let us never forget it<end_line>
Should we ever live to regret it<end_line>
Like that day John F. Kennedy was assassinated in broad day<end_line>
By the greatest lunatic with a gun<end_line>
Who just happened to work on the same block in the library book depository<end_line>
Where the President would go for a little Friday stroll<end_line>
Shots fired from the grassy knoll<end_line>
But they don't know, or do they<end_line>
Who's they, for 'em to say, touche'<end_line>
We're all vulnerable and its spook-ay<end_line>
This is about as kook-ay, as I've ever felt now<end_line>
Count down to nuclear meltdown<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
You can run, you can do what you want to<end_line>
But you know you ain't gonna do nothing<end_line>
When its time, it's your time<end_line>
You are the prime target<end_line>
You have become Public Enemy #1<end_line>
<verse_end>
