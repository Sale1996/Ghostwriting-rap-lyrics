Yo, yo<end_line>
Cool, calm, just like my mom<end_line>
With a couple of lawsuits inside her palm<end_line>
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve <end_line>
To roll up on you like Christopher Reeves<end_line>
I can't describe the vibe I get<end_line>
When I drive by six people and five I hit<end_line>
Aww, I started a mosh pit<end_line>
Squashed a chick and lost her foster kids<end_line>
This room make me hallucinate<end_line>
Then I sweat 'til I start losin weight<end_line>
'Til I see dumbstart happenin<end_line>
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin to rap again<end_line>
So bounce, bounce, come on bounce<end_line>
I said come on, bounce<end_line>
Everybody in the house doin mass amounts<end_line>
To the women in the thongs with they asses out<end_line>
We don't bull, better ask around<end_line>
D-12 throws the bombest bash in town<end_line>
Bizarre, your mom is crashin out<end_line>
Help me get her on the couch 'fore she passes out<end_line>
Come on!<end_line>

Dirty Dozen, eighty of us, Shady brothers, ladies love us<end_line>
That's why our baby mothers love us but they hate each other<end_line>
They probably wanna take each other out and date each other<end_line>
Some-, somethin, some'un, some'un, some'un<end_line>
