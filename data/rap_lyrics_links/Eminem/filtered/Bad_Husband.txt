We never saw from each other's sides, or eye to eye<end_line>
Just eye for eye, lie for lie, fight or flight<end_line>
So much baggage need a luggage rack, but we carry on with our public spats<end_line>
And our feud's up, back in the news; love taps when I dissed you<end_line>
like it was fun, actually used to run, back to the booth, jump back in the studio<end_line>
Give you a tongue lashing then you, laughed at a stomach tat with the tomb-<end_line>
-stone, it was funny back in our youth, but then it wasn't after we knew<end_line>
that we were done, and actually through<end_line>
But if there's one, fraction of truth, if it could be spun, back I would do<end_line>
so many things different, cause it was such, a dumbass excuse<end_line>
You hit me once, and that I would use to continue the pattern of abuse<end_line>
Why did I punch back? Girls, your dad is a scumbag, I'm confused<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
You were the beat I loved with a writer's block<end_line>
The line that's hot, that I forgot - we laughed a little, cried a lot<end_line>
I'll never forget when you came home and you held Hailie, day before you went to jail and daily<end_line>
How we'd wait for that mail lady, or by the phone for Mom to call<end_line>
And I watched you pull yourself up and we decided on givin it one more try despite it all<end_line>
You're my lightning rod, when my sky gets dark, I'm your shiny rocks<end_line>
in that tiny box when we tied the knot, when we broke the knot<end_line>
Every line we crossed, we were supposed to not, every time we fought, the insults that got<end_line>
thrown too far, words that we said that we didn't mean, the words that we meant that we didn't say<end_line>
The ones that we thought that we shoulda said, letters written that we coulda read<end_line>
Which maybe woulda lead to some good instead and had this put to bed<end_line>
But I'd be lyin still if I said I wasn't sittin here askin myself<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Forever be a hero, in my eyes<end_line>
But there's always another side<end_line>
to a good father, a great dad, but a bad husband<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
We brought out the worst in each other, someone had to make the sparring end<end_line>
Cause I loved you but I hated that me, and I don't wanna see that side again<end_line>
But I'm sorry Kim, more than you could ever comprehend<end_line>
Leavin you was fuckin harder than, sawing off a fuckin body limb<end_line>
Once upon a time we're all we had, maybe that's what drew us to each other, it was true love<end_line>
Shit we never knew was possible, we might have loved each other too much<end_line>
And maybe that's what made us do what we did to each other, all the screw-ups<end_line>
cause you always thought that you was<end_line>
more in love with me and I was thinkin I was more in love than you was<end_line>
For all the times that we thought it worked, 'til we saw how wrong we were<end_line>
When the dust settles now and all the dirt<end_line>
If I touch the rawest nerve, all I want is for us not to hurt<end_line>
And it's been an exhaustive search, to find the words<end_line>
But I just heard, "Mockingbird", and got the urge, to jot some verses<end_line>
and thoughts, the purpose was not, to stir up, or open wounds, I've caused a few<end_line>
And so have you, or argue whose, fault it was, partly yours<end_line>
Partly mine, but really no one's, this is so tough, I'm gettin choked up<end_line>
Oh fuck it, we both suck; we broke up, got back together<end_line>
We both thought, we had forever, not bad people, just bad together<end_line>
We were so nuts, back-stabbed each other, another blow struck<end_line>
But there's no duckin this blow cause, it's over, and it's closure<end_line>
But, I'm not so sure how to close this, I just don't know<end_line>
how some people can be so good at one thing and so fucked at a whole 'nother<end_line>
Shit, it's no wonder<end_line>
<verse_end>
