Man Tip told me on this hoe tip, best tip I can give you <end_line>
to hip you is never to let these tricks trick you<end_line>
Mighty ambiguous of you to think I love you slut, shit<end_line>
Dig a hole, take this shovel and dig you some dignity bitch<end_line>
Shit you talk about some advice that sticks with you<end_line>
If I should listen to anyone tell me to stick to my guns like double stick, it's you<end_line>
But fuck it Tip, it's cool - I'm chillin like a villain<end_line>
like The Penguin in his fuckin igloo eatin fudgescicles<end_line>
I'd rather slip and fall in shit than fall in love wit'chu<end_line>
'Fore I tie a fuckin knot I'd tie you in one, bitch you<end_line>
think this is some Nintendo game, how fuckin dumb is you?<end_line>
I'll give you some lumps, 'fore I split some lump sums wit'chu<end_line>
So here's a penny for your thoughts but it won't buy you a cheeseburger<end_line>
But a nickel might just get you one pickle<end_line>
Fuck it it's official so blow the whistle<end_line>
I got a trust issue, there's a bombshell, SCUD missile<end_line>
Like I just cuss at you to fuckin cuss at you<end_line>
Like before I rapped I was a motherfuckin stud, slut this'll<end_line>
teach you not to come drunk stumblin my way, for shizzle<end_line>
I still live like I bought you the Gilbert slots check stub bizzle<end_line>
So fuck Sizzlers, these checkers'll bust like a BLOOD blister!<end_line>

Yeah I guess life is a bitch, ain't it Tip? And each one thinks they the shit<end_line>
Shirt off my back? I wouldn't give you the dirt off my hankerchief<end_line>
I'm givin these hoes a dose of they own medicine, let 'em get a good taste of it<end_line>
I'm sure you got that relationship memo by now but in case you didn't<end_line>
This shit's so bad better stick your nose to your forehead and staple it<end_line>
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wastin it<end_line>
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker, that clock I'm racin it; double timin it<end_line>
but I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time that it may take you pricks<end_line>
to catch on, while you strong-arm like Stretch Armstrong<end_line>
Man I still say K-Mart's like there's an apostrophe-S on it dawg<end_line>
And they say McDonald's isn't a restaurant, well I guess I'm wrong<end_line>
But if you're gonna tell me that A&W ain't the spot for the best hot dogs you can get the F on dawg<end_line>
