The flow is bone crushin', it's nothin'<end_line>
I come up with somethin'<end_line>
Come through your strip, frontin', stuntin'<end_line>
It's something you want, 745 chrome spinners<end_line>
Haters hate that I'm winnin'<end_line>
Man I've been hot from the beginnin'<end_line>
Motherfuckers envy the kid, control your jealousy<end_line>
'Cause I can't control my temper, I'm fittin' to catch a felony<end_line>
Pistol in hand homie, I'm down to get it poppin'<end_line>
Once I squeeze the first shot, you know I ain't stoppin'<end_line>
Till my clip is empty, I'm simply<end_line>
Not that nigga you should try your luck with, or fuck with<end_line>
Hollow-tip shells struck you with your bones broken, guns smokin', still locin',<end_line>
what nigga, lay your ass down paramedics get you up feeling<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
These are my ideas<end_line>
This is my sweat and tears<end_line>
This is shit that I saw with my balls, my ears<end_line>
This is me, who's gotta be<end_line>
What you see on TV, what you hear on CD, what appears easy<end_line>
Man these teenie boopers see me on these magazine covers<end_line>
In these beanies and these rags, living fantasies<end_line>
Frontin' like it's all fun and games, 'til the shoot'em up bang<end_line>
And you see your brains hang and you see we ain't playin'<end_line>
Ain't sayin' we ain't layin' down at night and ain't prayin'<end_line>
I bullied my way in this game, man I'm done playin'<end_line>
Man I'm done sayin' that I'm done playin', I'm a start layin' into these<end_line>
motherfuckering cocksuckers<end_line>
There's no way I'm back down, like a god damn coward<end_line>
I can't, how would I look as a man, bowin' to his knees<end_line>
Like the mad cow disease, let somebody lash out at me<end_line>
And not lash back out at 'em, please<end_line>
Oh, whao, yo, ho, hold up, oh no, not me, not Marshall<end_line>
You wanna see Marshall? I'll show you Marshall<end_line>
I try to show you art, but you just pick it apart<end_line>
So I see I have to start, showin' you fuckin' old farts,<end_line>
A whole other side, I wanted to not show you<end_line>
So you know you're not dealing with some fuckin' marshmallow <end_line>
Little soft yellow, punk pussy, who's heart's Jello, 'cause<end_line>
