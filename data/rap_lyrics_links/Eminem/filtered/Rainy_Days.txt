I left my legacy hurt? Fuckin absurd<end_line>
Like a shepherd havin sex with his sheep, fuck what you heard/herd<end_line>
All this talk in my ear, I got a idea, like the clerk when you're tryna buy beer<end_line>
Since on the mic, I'm a nightmare<end_line>
Fuck it, I thought this might be a good time to put woke me to rockabye<end_line>

You want the sleep me to wake, you want "Slim Shady EP"<end_line>

I promise not to cry crocodile tears<end_line>
If you end up shocked at my lyrics<end_line>
Marshall is dead in the water but not that I care<end_line>
Dre said "Rock the boat" and the Doc/dock is my peer/pier<end_line>
So, it's unanimous you're at attention<end_line>
The planet's listenin and their banana splits again, which has its advantages<end_line>
But when you got nothin to say except for the hand your dick is in<end_line>
And if your plan's to stick it in Janice Dickinson<end_line>
Imagine if the Temazepam is kickin in, it's havin you panic-stricken<end_line>
You're trippin off of tryptophan and tripped a fan in Switzerland<end_line>
Just for askin to autograph a picture, then ripped it in<end_line>
half and whipped it at him and kicked his ass all the way back to Michigan<end_line>
But no matter how many, rounds<end_line>
or, if I get knocked down in a, bout<end_line>
and fell to the ground, I got a, fighter's men-<end_line>
-tality, I'll get back up and fight with it<end_line>
In fact I'm a-ttackin the, mic with it<end_line>
I'll make it soundsound like a vampire's bitin it<end_line>
But I'd have to be Dracula's sidekick<end_line>
to be down for the +Count+<end_line>
