<verse_start>
I used to be a lonely man, only mad, until I got a million dollars, shit<end_line>
Now if i only had some fucking hair I'd pull it, faster than a bullet<end_line>
out of Tupac's chest before the ambulance came too late to do it<end_line>
I'm trying to grow it back again, it was an accident<end_line>
I had my back against the fan and chopped it off in Amsterdam<end_line>
I hate the straight jacket it aint latching, and can't lock it<end_line>
so they stapled my hand to my pants pockets<end_line>
The cell's padded and battered like someone else had it<end_line>
before me, and just kept throwing they fucking selfs at it<end_line>
My head is aching, I'm dedicated to medication<end_line>
but this med is taking to long to bring me this sedadation?<end_line>
Anyway I got down with Dre<end_line>
The first man who taught me how the glock sounded to spray<end_line>
Running up and down the street screaming, "Fuck the Police"<end_line>
when you still had your mother's fucking Nipple stuck in your teeth<end_line>
Became a role model after Colorado<end_line>
Now all they do is follow me around and holla Bravo!<end_line>
Hell yea I punch my bitch and beat my kids in public<end_line>
Suck my dick, bitch<end_line>
I'm sick enough to fuck a man in his face but I won't<end_line>
cause you'll probably wanna stand in his place<end_line>
So put a sock in it, with your fake-ass Tupac image<end_line>
You faggots ain't tough, you just get drunk and become talkative<end_line>
 I'm probably the akwardest alcoholic talking<end_line>
Walking like a midget with a ladder in his back pocket<end_line>
So when you see me on your block stumbling, mumbling<end_line>
A bunch of dumb shit like my drunk uncle does<end_line>
I ain't buzzed, I'mm juss high on life<end_line>
So why on earth would I need drugs, when I can fly on kites?<end_line>
Motherfuckers, Slim Shady<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
The whole entire world can sit and twirl like a whirling tire<end_line>
I set a fucking girl on fire with a curling iron<end_line>
Psych I'm just joking, for christ sake<end_line>
Dont get so bent out of shape <end_line>
cause I went out and raped six girlfriends<end_line>
Some people just don't get it, but I won't let it upset me<end_line>
cause they don't know better<end_line>
They don't know what the fuck its like to be so fed up<end_line>
and fed so many uppers you're down and won't get up<end_line>
My mind's got a mind of it's own, sometimes I can't find it at home<end_line>
it hides in the stove<end_line>
Shit, talk about your brain being baked<end_line>
My shit's still in the oven on 480 De-Grades<end_line>
Hailey Jade, daddy loves you baby,<end_line>
Don't ever tell me how to raise my daughter fuck you lady<end_line>
You critics wanna criticize but couldnt visualize<end_line>
individuals lives through a criminal's eyes<end_line>
The neighborhood that I grew up in you could die for nothing<end_line>
and Dirty Dozen watches over me so try some dumb shit<end_line>
I'll have a fucking man raped with a band-aid over his mouth<end_line>
and shove his head in the fan blade<end_line>
Don't ever tell me what I can and what I can't say<end_line>
or change cause of the age range in my fan base<end_line>
Like I give a fuck who's buying this shit<end_line>
Quit fucking buying it, I'm tired bitch, I'm dying to quit<end_line>
Hip Hop is universal now, it's all commercial now<end_line>
It's like a circle full of circus clowns up in the circuit now<end_line>
But now the white kids like it, so they tell me I can buy it<end_line>
but as soon as I get on the mic it's like the night get silent<end_line>
either that or booed, thats why I keep an attitude<end_line>
and go to sleep with it and wake up with it every afternoon<end_line>
I'm sick of being judged, fuck it let me see a judge<end_line>
I'll confess to every murder I committed since 3 years old<end_line>
