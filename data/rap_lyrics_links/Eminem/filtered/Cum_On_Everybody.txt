My favoite color is red, like the blood shed<end_line>
from Kurt Cobain's head, when he shot himself dead<end_line>
Women all grabbin at my shishkabob<end_line>
Bought Lauryn Hill's tape so her kids could starve<end_line>
You thought I was ill and now I'm even more so<end_line>
Shit I got full blown AIDS and a sore throat<end_line>
I got a wardrobe with an orange robe<end_line>
I'm in the fourth row, signin autographs at your show<end_line>
I just remembered that I'm absent minded<end_line>
Wait, I mean I've lost my mind, I can't find it<end_line>
I'm freestylin every verse that I spit<end_line>
cause I don't even remember the words to my shit<end_line>
I told the doc I need a change in sickness<end_line>
and gave a girl herpes in exchange for syphilis<end_line>
Put my LP on your Christmas gift list<end_line>
You wanna get high, here bitch just sniff this<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Yo.. yo yo yo yo<end_line>
I tried suicide once and I'll try it again<end_line>
That's why I write songs where I die at the end<end_line>
Cause I don't give a fuck, like my middle finger was stuck<end_line>
and I was wavin it at everybody screamin, "I suck" <end_line>
I go on stage in front of a sellout crowd<end_line>
and yell out loud, "All y'all get the hell out now"<end_line>
Fuck rap, I'm givin it up y'all, I'm sorry<end_line>
I'm bored out of my gourd -- so I took a hammer <end_line>
and nailed my foot to the floorboard of my Ford<end_line>
Guess I'm just a sick sick bastard<end_line>
who's one sandwich short of a picnic basket<end_line>
One Excederin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet<end_line>
I feel like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage<end_line>
 And if you ever see a video for this shit<end_line>
I'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Got bitches on my jock out in East Detroit<end_line>
Cause they think that I'm a motherfuckin Beastie Boy<end_line>
So I told em I was Mike D<end_line>
They was like, "Gee I don't know, he might be!"<end_line>
I told em, "Meet me at Kid Rock's next concert<end_line>
I'll be standin by the Loch Ness Monsterpeace out"<end_line>
Then I jetted to the weed house<end_line>
Smoked out til I started bustin freestyles<end_line>
Broke out then I dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick<end_line>
Crushed up the Tylenol and ate it with a dipstick<end_line>
Made a couple of crank calls collect<end_line>
"Ken Kaniff from Connecticut, can you accept?"<end_line>
I wanna make songs all the fellas dub<end_line>
And murder every rich rapper that I'm jealous of<end_line>
So just remember when I bomb your set<end_line>
Yo, I only cuss to make your mom upset<end_line>
<verse_end>
