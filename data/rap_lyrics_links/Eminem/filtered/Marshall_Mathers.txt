<verse_start>
You know I just don't get it<end_line>
Last year I was nobody<end_line>
This year I'm sellin records<end_line>
Now everybody wants to come around like I owe em somethin<end_line>
Heh, the fuck you want from me, ten million dollars?<end_line>
Get the fuck out of here<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Yo, you might see me joggin, you might see me walkin<end_line>
You might see me walkin a dead rottweiler dog<end_line>
with it's head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar<end_line>
hollerin at him cause the son of a bitch won't quit barkin<end_line>
Or leanin out a window, with a cocked shotgun<end_line>
Drivin up the block in the car that they shot 'Pac in<end_line>
Lookin for Big's killers, dressed in ridiculous<end_line>
blue and red like I don't see what the big deal is<end_line>
Double barrel twelve gauge bigger than Chris Wallace<end_line>
Pissed off, cause Biggie and 'Pac just missed all this<end_line>
Watchin all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em<end_line>
and get dollars that shoulda been there's like they switched wallets<end_line>
And amidst all this Crist' poppin and wristwatches<end_line>
I had to sit back and just watch and just get nauseous<end_line>
and walk around with an empty bottle of Remi Martin<end_line>
startin shit like some 26-year-old skinny Cartman<end_line>
I'm anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin<end_line>
with instincts to kill N'Sync, don't get me started<end_line>
These fuckin brats can't sing and Britney's garbage<end_line>
What's this bitch retarded?  Gimme back my sixteen dollars<end_line>
All I see is sissies in magazines smiling<end_line>
Whatever happened to whylin out and bein violent?<end_line>
Whatever happened to catchin a good-ol' fashioned<end_line>
passionate ass-whoopin and gettin your shoes coat and your hat tooken?<end_line>
New Kids on the Block, sucked a lot of dick<end_line>
Boy/girl groups make me sick<end_line>
And I can't wait 'til I catch all you faggots in public<end_line>
I'ma love it..<end_line>
Vanilla Ice don't like me<end_line>
Said some shit in Vibe to spite me<end_line>
Then went and dyed his hair just like me<end_line>
A bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me<end_line>
and run around screamin, "I don't care, just bite me"<end_line>
I think I was put here to annoy the world<end_line>
and destroy your little 4-year-old boy or girl<end_line>
Plus I was put here to put fear in faggots who spray Faygo Root Beer<end_line>
and call themselves "Clowns" cause they look queer<end_line>
Faggot2Dope and Silent Gay<end_line>
Claimin Detroit, when y'all live twenty miles away<end_line>
And I don't wrestle, I'll knock you fuckin faggots the fuck out<end_line>
Ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out<end_line>
after they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out<end_line>
Ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck, blaow!<end_line>
Look at y'all runnin your mouth again<end_line>
when you ain't seen a fuckin Mile Road, South of 10<end_line>
And I don't need help, from D-12, to beat up two females<end_line>
in make-up, who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails<end_line>
"Slim Anus," you damn right, Slim Anus<end_line>
I don't get fucked in mine like you two little flaming faggots!<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me?<end_line>
You little groupie bitch, get off me, go fuck Puffy<end_line>
Now because of this blonde mop that's on top<end_line>
and this fucked up head that I've got, I've gone pop?<end_line>
The underground just spunned around and did a 360<end_line>
Now these kids diss me and act like some big sissies<end_line>
"Oh, he just did some shit with Missy,<end_line>
 so now he thinks he's too big to do some shit with MC Get-Bizzy"<end_line>
My fuckin bitch mom's suin for ten million<end_line>
She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealin<end_line>
Shit, where the fuck you think I picked up the habit?<end_line>
All I had to do was go in her room and lift up her mattress<end_line>
Which is it bitch, Mrs. Briggs or Ms. Mathers?<end_line>
It doesn't matter yourfaggot!<end_line>
Talkin about I fabricated my past<end_line>
He's just aggravated I won't ejaculate in his ass<end_line>
So tell me, what the hell is a fella to do?<end_line>
For every million I make, another relative sues<end_line>
Family fightin and fussin over who wants to invite me to supper<end_line>
All the sudden, I got 90 some cousins<end_line>
A half-brother and sister who never seen me<end_line>
or even bothered to call me until they saw me on TV<end_line>
Now everybody's so happy and proud<end_line>
I'm finally allowed to step foot in my girlfriend's house<end_line>
Hey-hey!  And then to top it off, I walked to the newsstand<end_line>
to buy this cheap-ass little magazine with a food stamp<end_line>
Skipped to the last page, flipped right fast<end_line>
and what do I see?  A picture of my big white ass<end_line>
Okay, let me give you motherfuckers some help:<end_line>
uhh, here - DOUBLE XL, DOUBLE XL<end_line>
Now your magazine shouldn't have so much trouble to sell<end_line>
Ahh fuck it, I'll even buy a couple myself<end_line>
