You see that chick in the gym, checkin' me out<end_line>
Any second I'm bout to stick her neck in my mouth<end_line>
I lose a pill, and I'm wrecklessly reckin' the house<end_line>
That was supposed to be breakfast, where the heck is it now<end_line>
There's the neckless I lost, clingin' to Stephanie's blouse<end_line>
Man I should check to see if my mom left any out<end_line>
Nope, guess I'll re-route<end_line>
Maybe somewhere in the depths of the couch<end_line>
Oh jackpot, yeah, open sesame mouth<end_line>
Down the hatch, and the feelin' you can't match it<end_line>
I rat-tat-tat on your door with the damn ratchet<end_line>
Att-ack-tack-tacking a whore with the damn hatchet<end_line>
A napsack pack with like 40sumn Xanax's<end_line>
Shorty come back, I'm tryna score me some lap dances<end_line>
Cause I'm bout to relapse, so baby pour me some Jack Daniels<end_line>
Forumla 44D and 40's with bad capsules<end_line>
The bad apple spoils the bunch, I'm back atcha<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
My equilibrium's off, must be the lithium<end_line>
I don't need to buy any drugs, man people gimmie um<end_line>
It just becomes everyday, extra curriculum<end_line>
No reason inparticular, it was strictly fun<end_line>
a 5th of trone and 2 bottles of 151<end_line>
51 people asleep in my damn living room<end_line>
Excuse me hun, but what is your name, Vivienne?<end_line>
I woke up next to ya naked and err, did we um<end_line>
Of course we did, but didn't I strap a jimmy hun?<end_line>
I'm looking for the torn rapper but there don't seem to be one<end_line>
No offense baby girl, I don't mean any harm<end_line>
But disease is something I'm tryna keep my penis free from<end_line>
I find the package and I'm cool, I immediately run<end_line>
Like Speedy Gonzales, Alistar see if I see anyone<end_line>
Who might have a couple of 3's I'm fiendin' for some<end_line>
My head is pounding to the beat of the drum<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Oh, those were the days, they certainly were<end_line>
It's hurtin' me to know I'll be closin' that curtain for good<end_line>
Word, word, word, word, word, word, word<end_line>
I second that and a third, rushed to emergency surgery<end_line>
To try to flush me because of the drugs that he purchased<end_line>
He's no longer getting them free, 100 bucks for these percodans<end_line>
Plus it's getting to be where he lustfully searched the den<end_line>
Pain is hitting his knee and his muscles be hurting him<end_line>
Tirelessly on the phone trying to russle up, muscle relaxants<end_line>
For his back, and a couple of blacksons, now he's doubling backwards<end_line>
And he's stumbling back, slipped and fell, hit his back bone<end_line>
Heard something go crack, Now he's up in the bathroom<end_line>
Like he's busting a nap, almost ended it that soon<end_line>
Because of the fact, I'm just busting my own chops<end_line>
While I'm busting a rap, resuscitated and rejuved, so fuck it I'm back<end_line>
<verse_end>
