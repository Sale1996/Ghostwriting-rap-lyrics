Peace to Thirstin Howl, A.L. and Wordsworth<end_line>
My mother smoked crack, I had a premature birth<end_line>
I'm just a nerd cursed, wit badly disturbed nerves<end_line>
Who wanna be the one to step up and get served first?<end_line>
Ninety-nine percent of aliens prefer earth<end_line>
So I'm here to rule the planet, startin wit your turf<end_line>
I hid a secret message inside of a wordsearch<end_line>
Wit smeard letters, runnin together in blurred spurts<end_line>
I hang wit male chauvinist pigs and perverts<end_line>
Who point water pistols at women and squirt shirts<end_line>
Been a bad boy since diapers and Gerber's<end_line>
My first words were "Bleep bleep" and "Curse curse"<end_line>
Never had ish, and I still don't deserve dirt<end_line>
My breath still stinks and I'm on my third Certs<end_line>
Yankin out my stitches, hollering "Nurse nurse!"<end_line>
"You said this shot would numb it, trick it just hurts worse!"<end_line>
Grew up in a dump next door to a burnt church<end_line>
But gunshots drowned out crickets and bird chirps<end_line>
And it's like that, and it's like that<end_line>
