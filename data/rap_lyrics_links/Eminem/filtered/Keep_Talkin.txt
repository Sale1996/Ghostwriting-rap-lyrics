I'm widely the best, God in the flesh<end_line>
Blow your heart out of your chest<end_line>
And your chest out of your vest<end_line>
Leave your body a mess, streets bloody as hell<end_line>
Study my 12, I cut him he fell<end_line>
A druggie on bail, nutty as well<end_line>
With search light, bud he revealed, dead or in jail<end_line>
They're headed for hell<end_line>
Together with bells and blonde guy, get your lungs hard<end_line>
Leave you full of holes like Spongebob<end_line>
We can take this from your front door to your CEO office<end_line>
Got the key to your coffin<end_line>
Leavin your office, we takin over<end_line>
Or get Chyna White, mixed with baking soda<end_line>
Ya hear me...GET CRACK!<end_line>

And this is just mixtape shit, you fuckin' morons!<end_line>
This ain't brains over brawn<end_line>
This is bullies over fuckin pussies!<end_line>
Come on!<end_line>
