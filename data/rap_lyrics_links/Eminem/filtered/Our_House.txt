I wanna be the best who ever did it<end_line>
Don't know if that goal is feasible, or it isn't<end_line>
But if it is then God if you're listenin<end_line>
Please give me the strength to crush all competition<end_line>
You can't blame me for dreamin, I'm a dreamer<end_line>
And if I'm comin off brash please forgive me<end_line>
But, that's all I want<end_line>
That's all I want<end_line>

<verse_start>
In our, house we spittin like six hours, the way I feel now I can spit for six hours<end_line>
straight, only way to be great, is to dig down, if you can hear this sound in-<end_line>
-side my head sounds like a fuckin drive-by, that's what the inside of my mind's like<end_line>
Lookin back on, my career even, hindsight's, tunnel vision, 5 Mics<end_line>
Never wanted that so bad, feel like I could go mad, nomad with a notepad<end_line>
Go Taz, spaz on these hoe bags that bother me but I never wanna show that<end_line>
Just don't act like it ever does, even though you know that there will never come<end_line>
a day someone blows past you who never was, someone who's as dope as you ever was<end_line>
And you hope that's, true cause the competitor in you couldn't let somebody be better than you<end_line>
And you know that, so you don't ever hold back, what you gonna go back, to workin a regular job?<end_line>
Fuck that, I'ma go hard grab on my, gonads - tell 'em fuck theyself<end_line>
They call me a wigger/'weger like Renee Zell' but I, raised hell like a stay-at-home dad!<end_line>
Rap is the only thing that I was ever really, bad to the bone at<end_line>
Guess I'm similar to, Gang Green when I'm, angry then I'm, Hulk Smash<end_line>
So much passion but no compassion, if eyes are the window to the soul<end_line>
then it's, broken glass and there's no trespassin, aight now here we go<end_line>
Dre stamped me now I'm stampin Yelawolf, be ready for the most competitive<end_line>
clique in the world, it's like Clash of the Titans, I release the cracker, it's time to set it again<end_line>
And when it's said and it's all done none shall ever fuck with the squadron<end_line>
So come on in at your own risk; this isbitch!<end_line>
