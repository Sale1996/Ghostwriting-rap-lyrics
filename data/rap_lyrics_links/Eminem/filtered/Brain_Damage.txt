These are the results of a thousand electric volts<end_line>
A neck with bolts, "Nurse we're losin him, check the pulse!"<end_line>
A kid who refused to respect adults<end_line>
Wore spectacles with taped frames and a freckled nose<end_line>
A corny lookin white boy, scrawny and always ornery<end_line>
Cause I was always sick of brawny bullies pickin on me<end_line>
And I might snap, one day just like that<end_line>
I decided to strike back and flatten every tire on the bike rack<end_line>
 My first day in junior high, this kid said,<end_line>
"It's you and I, three o'clock sharp this afternoon you die"<end_line>
I looked at my watch it was one twenty<end_line>
"I already gave you my lunch money what more do you want from me?!?"<end_line>
He said, "Don't try to run from me, you'll just make it worse..."<end_line>
My palms were sweaty, and I started to shake at first<end_line>
Something told me, "Try to fake a stomach ache it works"<end_line>
I screamed, "Owww!  My appendix feels like they could burst!<end_line>
Teacher, teacher, quick I need a naked nurse!"<end_line>
"What's the matter?"<end_line>
"I don't know, my leg, it hurts!"<end_line>
"Leg?!?  I thought you said it was your tummy?!?"<end_line>
"Oh, I mean it is, but I also got a bum knee!"<end_line>
"Mr. Mathers, the fun and games are over.<end_line>
     And just for that stunt, you're gonna get some extra homework."<end_line>
"But don't you wanna give me after school detention?"<end_line>
"Nah, that bully wants to beat your ass and I'ma let him."<end_line>

Brain damage..<end_line>
Way before my baby daughter Hailey<end_line>
I was harassed daily by this fat kid named D'Angelo Bailey<end_line>
An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, cause his father boxes<end_line>
so everyday he'd shove me in the lockers<end_line>
One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin<end_line>
And had me in the position to beat me into submission<end_line>
He banged my head against the urinal til he broke my nose,<end_line>
Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat<end_line>
I tried to plead and tell him, "We shouldn't beef"<end_line>
But he just wouldn't leave, he kept chokin me and I couldn't breathe<end_line>
He looked at me and said, "You gonna die honkey!"<end_line>
The principal walked in <end_line>
and started helpin him stomp me<end_line>
I made them think they beat me to death<end_line>
Holdin my breath for like five minutes before they finally left<end_line>
Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth<end_line>
Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four inch screws<end_line>
Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms, and foreign tools<end_line>
"This is for every time you took my orange juice,<end_line>
or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk.<end_line>
Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt.<end_line>
I'm gettin you back bully!  Now once and for good."<end_line>
I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could<end_line>
and beat him over the head with it til I broke the wood<end_line>
Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot..<end_line>
.. Made it home, later that same day<end_line>
Started reading a comic, and suddenly everything became gray<end_line>
I couldn't even see what I was tryin to read<end_line>
I went deaf, and my left ear started to bleed<end_line>
My mother started screamin, "What are you on, drugs?!?<end_line>
Look at you, you're gettin blood all over my rug!" <end_line>
She beat me over the head with the remote control<end_line>
opened a hole, and my whole brain fell out of my skull<end_line>
I picked it up and screamed, "Look bitch, what have you done?!?"<end_line>
"Oh my God, I'm sorry son"<end_line>
"Shut up you cunt!"  I said, "Fuck it!"<end_line>
Took it and stuck it back up in my head<end_line>
then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck<end_line>
<verse_end>

Brain damage..<end_line>
It's brain damage..<end_line>

It's brain damage..<end_line>
It's probably brain damage..<end_line>
It's brain damage..<end_line>
Brain damage..<end_line>
