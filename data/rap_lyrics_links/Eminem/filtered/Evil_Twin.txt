<verse_start>
I'm in a strange place<end_line>
I feel like Ma$e, when he gave up the game for his faith<end_line>
I feel like I'm caged, in these chains and restraints<end_line>
Grimmin every stranger in the place, while I gaze into space<end_line>
Cause I'm mentally, rearrangin his face<end_line>
I need a change of pace - cause the pace I'm workin at's dangerous<end_line>
There's nowhere to dump this anger, and thanks to this angst<end_line>
I done quit chicken heads cold turkey and started slowly roastin 'em<end_line>
Cause that's where most of my anger is based/baste!<end_line>
Fuck your feelings, I feel like I play for the Saints<end_line>
I just wanna hurt you, aim for the skanks<end_line>
Then aim for all these fake Kanye's, Jay's, Wayne's and the Drake's<end_line>
I'm frustrated cause ain't<end_line>
no more N'Sync, now I'm all out of wack<end_line>
I'm all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack<end_line>
I'm goin all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is I'm strapped<end_line>
for battles, sucka duck, crawl out the back<end_line>
It's a bar fight, prepare your arsenal, and beware of bar stools<end_line>
flyin through the air and bottles breakin, mirrors also<end_line>
And I ain't stoppin 'til the swear jar's full<end_line>
"You done called every woman a slut, but you're +Forgetting Sarah, Marshall+"<end_line>
Oh, my bad, slut<end_line>
And next time I show up in court, I'll be naked, and just wear a law-suit<end_line>
Judge be like, "That's sharp, how much that motherfucker cost you?<end_line>
Smart ass, you're lucky I don't tear it off you<end_line>
And jump your bones you, sexy motherfucker<end_line>
You're so fuckin gravy Marshall; I should start callin you +au jus+<end_line>
Cause alls you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo"<end_line>
Evil twin, take this beat now, it's all you<end_line>
I believe people can changebut only for the worse<end_line>
I coulda changed the world, if it wasn't for this verse<end_line>
So satanic K-Mart chains panic, cause they can't even spin back the curse words<end_line>
cause they're worse when they're reversed<end_line>
And these kids are like parrots<end_line>
They run around the house just like terrorists<end_line>
Screamin "fuck, shit, fuck~!" Adult with a childish-like arrogance<end_line>
Wild ever since the day I came out, I was like "Merits?<end_line>
Fuck that! I'd rather be loud and I like swearin"<end_line>
From the first album, even the gals were like "Tight lyrics<end_line>
Dreamy eyes," but my fuckin mouth was nightmarish<end_line>
And from the start of it you felt like you were part of this and<end_line>
opposition felt the opposite, sometimes I listen<end_line>
and revisit them old albums often as I can and skim through all them bitches<end_line>
to make sure I keep up with my competition<end_line>
Haha, hogger of beats, hoarder of rhymes<end_line>
Borderline genius who's bored of his lines<end_line>
And that sort of defines - where I'm at<end_line>
And the way I feel now, feel like I might just strike first, then ignore the replies<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
So who's left? Lady Gaga? Mess with the Bieber<end_line>
Nah, F with Christina, I ain't fuckin with either Jessica neither<end_line>
Simpson or Alba, my album's just sicker than strep with the fever<end_line>
Get the Chloraseptic, Excedrin, Aleve or<end_line>
Extra Strength Tylenol 3's, feel like I'm burnin to death but I'm freezin<end_line>
Bed-ridden and destined never to leave the<end_line>
bedroom ever again like the legend of Heath, uh<end_line>
Ledger, my suicide note's barely legible, read the<end_line>

Golly Wally I vent, heat register, Jesus!<end_line>
Ever since 19946 Dresden it was definitely my<end_line>
destiny when on the steps, I met Deshaun<end_line>
at Osborn, I'd never make it to sophomore<end_line>
I just wanted to skip school and rap, used to mop floors<end_line>
Flip burgers and wash dishes while I wrote rhymes tryin to get props for 'em<end_line>
Cause I took book smarts, and swapped for 'em<end_line>
They were sleepin, I made 'em stop snorin, made 'em break out the popcorn<end_line>
Now I've been hip-hop in its tip-top form<end_line>
Since N.W.A was blarin through my car windows leanin on the horn<end_line>
Screamin "Fuck tha Police" like COP PORN!<end_line>
Flipped rap on its ear, like I dropped corn<end_line>
Fuck Top 5 bitch, I'm Top 4!<end_line>
And that includes Biggie and 'Pac, whore<end_line>
And I got an evil twin, so who the fuck you think that third and that fourth SPOT'S FOR?<end_line>
And crazy as I am, I'm much tamer than him<end_line>
And I'm +nuts+, then again who the fuck wants a +plain Eminem+?<end_line>
But no one's insaner than Slim<end_line>
Look at thatplease come in, what was your name again?!<end_line>
Hi! Faggot, look who's back with a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there<end_line>
Two rabbits, a koala bear and a ball of hair<end_line>
And you're all aware I don't got it all upstairs<end_line>
Guess that's why I'm an addict/attic, and it's so small up there<end_line>
Peace to Whitney, geez, just hit me<end_line>
that I should call the loony police, to come get me<end_line>
Cause I'm so sick of bein the truth, I wish someone'd finally admit me<end_line>
to a mental hospital with Britney<end_line>
OHH! LMFAO, no way, Jo-<end_line>
-se Baez couldn't beat this rap, O.J. no<end_line>
Hooray, I'm off the hook<end_line>
like Casey Anthony, hey hoe, HEY HO!<end_line>
I sound like I'm tryin to sing the fuckin chorus to "Hip Hop Hooray"? No<end_line>
I'm hollerin, you got bottom end like an 8-0-<end_line>
-8, and Iwhether we're fuckin off that instead of your face so<end_line>
Let your low-end raise, yo!<end_line>
Tango? What you think hoe? Slow dancin or bowling?<end_line>
You tryin to hold hands with your homie?<end_line>
What? You think I'm lookin for romance cause I'm lonely?<end_line>
Change that tune, you ain't got a remote chance to control me<end_line>
Hoe, I'm only vulnerable when I got a boner<end_line>
Superman try to fuck me over, it won't hurt<end_line>
Don't try to fix me, I'm broke, so I don't work<end_line>
So are you, but you're broke, cause you don't work<end_line>
Haha, but all bullshit aside, I hit a stride<end_line>
Still Shady inside, hair every bit as dyed<end_line>
as it used to be, when I first introduced y'all to my skittish side<end_line>
And blamed it on him, when they tried to criticize<end_line>
Cause we are the same, bitch<end_line>
