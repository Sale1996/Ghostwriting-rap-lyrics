<verse_start>
I'm the devil - if ever there was such a thing<end_line>
The results of much too many drugs what you're seeing<end_line>
I'm a mindfuck, completely dis--ting<end_line>
I'm, a human mutt, fuck a being<end_line>
I'm a dog - fuck lambs, I'm silencin 'em all<end_line>
I'm involved in murders forensic science couldn't solve<end_line>
Giant set of balls too big to buy a set of drawers<end_line>
Might as well unzip my fly and let 'em fall to the floor<end_line>
Each thought's completely warped<end_line>
I'm like a walkin, talkin, ouija board<end_line>
Speakin in tongues, I've never spoke this speech before<end_line>
.. Hhem-delle-la, ennich-me-noughh-mi-niche-mick-norr ..<end_line>
Have you ever experienced spirits in lyrics when you hear 'em<end_line>
'til you scared to stare in into any mirrors when you near 'em?<end_line>
Well if so, get ready for some shit yo<end_line>
"Is this some kind of sick joke?" Shit no, motherfuckin schitzo<end_line>
So disturbed, he just goes so berzerk he tiptoes<end_line>
Fist first with scissors to slit throats of just hoes<end_line>
Just goes to shizzow you dizzon't, fizzuck with<end_line>
so-someone this disturbed, sa-sippin on si-zzurp<end_line>
So - lock your doors, drop to the floors<end_line>
Get your shotguns drawn - here comes another "Clockwork Orange"<end_line>
Look at Bizarre; you really think he's right in his mind?<end_line>
What the fuck you think's goin through it when he's writin his rhyme?<end_line>
