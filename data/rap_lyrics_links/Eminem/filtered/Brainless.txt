"Who can say for sure?<end_line>
 Perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer.<end_line>
 If science could operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use<end_line>
 society would reap a great benefit."<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I walk around like a space cadet, place your bets<end_line>
Who's likely to become a serial killer? Case of Tourette's<end_line>
Fuck, fuck fuck, can't take the stress<end_line>
I make a mess as the day progresses<end_line>
Angry and take it out on the neighbor's hedges<end_line>
Like "This is how I'll cut your face up bitches with these hedge trimmin scissors with razor edges"<end_line>
Imagination's dangerous, it's the only way to escape this mess<end_line>
and make the best of this situation, I guess<end_line>
Cause I feel like a little bitch, this predicament's<end_line>
despicable, I'm sick of just gettin pushed, it's ridiculous<end_line>
I look like a freakin wuss, a pussy, this kid just took<end_line>
my stick of licorice and threw my sticker books in a picker bush<end_line>
I wanna kick his tush, but I was 6 and shook<end_line>
This fucker was 12 and was six-foot with a vicious hook<end_line>
He hit me, I fell, I got back up, all I did was book<end_line>
Now there's usin your head - momma always said!<end_line>

Fast forward some years later, a teenager, this is a fun, sweet<end_line>
I just got jumped twice in one week, it's complete<end_line>
It's usually once a month, this is some feat<end_line>
I've accomplished, they've stomped me into the mud, gee for what reason? You stumped me<end_line>
But how do you get the shit beat out of you, beat down and be upbeat<end_line>
when you don't have no-thing?<end_line>
No valid shot at life, chance to make it or succeed<end_line>
Cause you're doomed from the start, it's like you grew up on Jump Street, from jump street!<end_line>
But if I could just get my head out my ass<end_line>
I could accomplish any task, practicin trash<end_line>
talkin in a trance, locked in my room yeah, but I got some plans momma<end_line>
These damn rhymes are fallin out of my pants pocket, I can't stop it!<end_line>
And I'm startin to blend in more, in school this shit helps for sure<end_line>
I'm gettin more self-assured than I've ever been before<end_line>
Plus no one picks on me anymore<end_line>
I done put a stop to that, threw my first punch, end of story<end_line>
Still in my skull's a vacant empty void, been usin it more as a bin for storage<end_line>
Take some inventory, in this gourd<end_line>
there's a Ford engine, door hinge, syringe, an orange, an extension cord, and a ninja sword<end_line>
Not to mention four linchpins, an astringent stored<end_line>
Ironin board, a bench, a wrench, a ore, winch, an attention whore<end_line>
Everything but a brain, but dome's off the fuckin chain, like an independent store<end_line>
Something's wrong with my head<end_line>
Just think if I had a brain in it, thank God that I don't<end_line>
cause I'd probably be Dahmer - cause momma always said!<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Now my mom, goes wamp-wamp-wamp<end_line>
Cause I'm not that smart, but I'm not dumb<end_line>
I was on the bottom of the pile gettin stomped<end_line>
But somehow, I came out on top<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I told you one day, I said they'd have that red carpet rolled out, yo<end_line>
I'm nice y'all, fuck it I'm out cold<end_line>
Now everywhere I go they scream out "Go!" I'm 'bout to clean house, yo<end_line>
I'm Lysol, now I'm just household<end_line>
Out-sold the sell-outs, freak the hell out, Middle America hear 'em yell out<end_line>
in terror they were so scared<end_line>
And those kids, just about, belted out, whatever spouted or fell out<end_line>
my smart-aleck mouth, it was so weird<end_line>
Inappropriate, so be it, I don't see it<end_line>
Maybe one day when the smoke clears, it won't be as<end_line>
motherfuckin, difficult yeah, 'til then hopefully ya<end_line>
little homos get over your fears and phobias<end_line>
It's okay to be scared straight, they said I provoked queers<end_line>
'til emotions evoke tears, my whole career's<end_line>
a stroke of sheer genius, smoke and mirrors, tactical practical jokes yeah<end_line>
You motherfuckin<end_line>
Who the fuck would've thunk that one little ol' MC'd<end_line>
be able to take the whole culture and re-upholstery it?<end_line>
And boy they did flock, can't believe this little hick locked<end_line>
this hip-hop shit in his hip pocket and still the shit got<end_line>
that white trash traffic in gridlock, shit hoppin like six blocks<end_line>
from a Kid Rock/Insane Clown Posse concert in mid Oc-<end_line>
-tober, and God forbid I <end_line>
see the Wizard and get a brain in my titanium cranium y'all cause<end_line>
I'll turn into the Unabomber - momma always said!<end_line>
<verse_end>
