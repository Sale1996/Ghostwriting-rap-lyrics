<verse_start>
Tearable but not rippable, invincible I hung invisible<end_line>
Fuckin mistletoe over the world<end_line>
I stuck my ass up under it, now pucker up them lips and kiss it hoe<end_line>
Here we go, Bad and Evil so you know how this'll go<end_line>
The competition's miserable, we stomp them bitches, this is no<end_line>
joke, goin overboard like someone threw us off the boat<end_line>
Choke, cough from all the smoke - I'm tryin to stay on fire<end_line>
so you know if I hate fuckin water sprinklers I don't love the hose/hoes<end_line>
Someone let the cat out the bag, now it's time to stuff its face<end_line>
back in that bitch, smother that little motherfucker 'til it suffocates<end_line>
YOU had long enough of a wait, why are they<end_line>
tryin to be so secretive? Bad and Evil is reunited, hey!<end_line>
Came back to annihilate, the game's in dire straits as I await<end_line>
Word on Satan as I drop, fall to my knees before this Ouija board and I pray<end_line>
Now I lay me down to sleep<end_line>
I do this shit in my sleep, I'm sleepin now, imagine if I awake!<end_line>
I'm champ bitch, I'll never taste the canvas<end_line>
Could never be no damn wuss or pussy, never mushy so you can't squish<end_line>
Nowhere near a tush, in fact if I jump out a bush<end_line>
in a sneak attack's the only way I'll say I am-Bush<end_line>
Outlandish, these +Words Are Weapons+ that I brandish<end_line>
Standoffish to hoes, keep your hands off this<end_line>
Can't top it, so what the fuck would I sugarcoat it for? Law? FUCK protocol!<end_line>
I'd holler at this hoe, but now my throat is sore<end_line>
<verse_end>
