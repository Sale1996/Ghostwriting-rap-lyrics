My words are weapons<end_line>
I use 'em to crush my opponents<end_line>
These words are weapons<end_line>

My words are weapons<end_line>
I use 'em to kill whoever's steppin to me<end_line>
My words are like weaponry on a record<end_line>

Yo, the rage I release on a page<end_line>
is like a demon unleashed in a cage<end_line>
Lunatic, soon as I hit the stage<end_line>

My nine is like a guidin light at night shinin bright<end_line>
My fuckin grip is tighter than my wife's vagina, psych<end_line>
These cock-suckin cops got my Smith-N-Wesson<end_line>
I guess it's time to pick a different weapon, man the shit's depressin<end_line>
But Swift is getting me a new one for a Christmas present<end_line>
They managed to confiscate the pistol that I brandish<end_line>
But my plan is to use this bullshit to my advantage<end_line>
