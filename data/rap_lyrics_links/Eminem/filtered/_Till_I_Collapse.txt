Till I collapse I'm spillin these raps long as you feel 'em<end_line>
Till the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin 'em<end_line>
Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pinnin 'em<end_line>
and I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem<end_line>
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin 'em<end_line>
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hoch venom<end_line>
Adrenalin shots of penicillin could not get the illin to stop<end_line>
Amoxacillin's just not real enough<end_line>
The criminal cop killin hip-hop villain<end_line>
A minimal swap to cop millions of 'Pac listeners<end_line>
You're comin with me, feel it or not you're gonna fear it<end_line>
like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us<end_line>
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock<end_line>
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin up?<end_line>
Fo' shizzle my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up<end_line>
You bizzles forgot, Slizzel does not give a fuck<end_line>
<verse_end>

Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin you get<end_line>
when you real and you spit an' people are feelin your shit<end_line>
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend<end_line>
tryin to hold on to it cause you may never get it again<end_line>
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can<end_line>
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end<end_line>
Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit gets in<end_line>
I got a list here's the order of my list that it's in<end_line>
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie<end_line>
Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me<end_line>
But in this industry I'm the cause of a LOT of envy<end_line>
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does NOT offend me<end_line>
That's why you see me walkin around like nothin's botherin me<end_line>
Even though half you people got a fuckin problem with me<end_line>
You hate it but you know respect you got to give me<end_line>
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney, Nate hit me<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Soon as the verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart<end_line>
What is he thinkin? How not to go against me, smart!<end_line>
And it's absurd, how people hang on ev-ery word<end_line>
I'll probably NEVER get the props I feel I ever deserve<end_line>
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved<end_line>
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first<end_line>
Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin could ever be worse<end_line>
That's why I'm clever when I put together ev-ery verse<end_line>
My thoughts, are sporadic, I act, like I'm a addict<end_line>
I rap, like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers<end_line>
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles<end_line>
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers<end_line>
So this is like a full blown attack I'm launchin at 'em<end_line>
The track is on some battlin raps who want some static?<end_line>
Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters<end_line>
A plaque and platinum status is WACK if I'm not the baddest, so<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Until the roof<end_line>
The roof comes off<end_line>
The roof comes off<end_line>
Until my legs<end_line>
Until my legs<end_line>
Give out from under me<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Feels like no one can beat me<end_line>
<verse_end>
