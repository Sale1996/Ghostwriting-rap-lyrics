He's comin home with his neck scratched, to catch flack<end_line>
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched<end_line>
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict<end_line>
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back<end_line>
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack<end_line>
She's kept track of all his internet chats<end_line>
And guess who just happens to be movin onto the next? Ac-<end_line>
-tually, just shit on my last chick, and she has what my +Ex-Lacks+<end_line>
Cause she loves danger, psychopath<end_line>
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that<end_line>
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back, knife in hand<end_line>
Says their relationship's hangin by a strand<end_line>
So she's been on the web lately<end_line>
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man/Spider-Man<end_line>
And I know she's usin me, to try to play him<end_line>
I don't care, hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said "Bye Suzanne"<end_line>
after the first night, but tonight I am<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
A one-night stand, turned to two-night stand<end_line>
It was "Come sunlight, scram," now we hug tight, and<end_line>
He found out, now she feels deserted and used<end_line>
Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too<end_line>
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?<end_line>
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue<end_line>
don't want this to hurt but what you deserve is the truth<end_line>
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you<end_line>
So I revert to the stu-<end_line>
-dio like hole-in-the-wall diners, don't have to be reserved in a booth<end_line>
I just feel like the person who I'm turnin into's<end_line>
irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew<end_line>
And now that I got you I don't want you, took advantage in my thirst to pursue<end_line>
Why do I do this dirt that I do?<end_line>
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech<end_line>
Detergent and bleach is burnin the wound, cause now with her in the womb<end_line>
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew<end_line>
to use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
My name'smy name's<end_line>
Riverriver run<end_line>
Call mecall me<end_line>
Always the bridesmaid, never "The bride, hey!"<end_line>
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway<end_line>
and deceit was an enclave, I'd be swervin in five lanes<end_line>
Speeds at a high rate like I'm slidin on ice, maybe<end_line>
That's why I may, have came at you sideways<end_line>
I can't keep my lies straight<end_line>
But I made you terminate, my baby<end_line>
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled<end_line>
What else can I say? It was fun for a while<end_line>
Bet I really woulda loved your smile<end_line>
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it<end_line>
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?<end_line>
<verse_end>
