Come here little kiddies on my lap<end_line>
Guess who's back with a brand new rap<end_line>
And I don't mean rap as in a new case<end_line>
Of child molestation accusates<end_line>
Ah ah ah ah ah, no worries<end_line>
Papa's got a brand new bag of toys<end_line>
What else could I possibly do to make noise?<end_line>
I've done touched on everything but little boys<end_line>
That's not a stab at Michael<end_line>
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho<end_line>
I go a little bit crazy sometimes<end_line>
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes<end_line>
Good god, dip, do a little slide<end_line>
Bend down, touch your toes, and just glide<end_line>
To the center of the dance floor<end_line>
Like TP for my bung hole<end_line>
And it's cool if you let one go<end_line>
Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?<end_line>
Give a little "poot poot," it's ok<end_line>
Oops my CD just skipped<end_line>
And everyone just heard you let one rip<end_line>

It's Friday and it's my day <end_line>
Used to party all the way to Sunday<end_line>
Maybe 'til Monday<end_line>
I don't know what day<end_line>
Everyday's just a holiday<end_line>
Cruisin' on the freeway, feelin' kind of breezy<end_line>
Let the top down and my hair blow<end_line>
I don't know where I'm goin'<end_line>
All I know is when I ger there someone's gonna<end_line>
Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk<end_line>
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work<end_line>
Would you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair<end_line>
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out<end_line>
Now what's ya name girl, what's ya sign?<end_line>
Drebeer goggles, blind<end_line>
I'm just tryin' to unwind<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
It's Tuesday and I'm locked up<end_line>
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened<end_line>
They say I was runnin' butt naked<end_line>
Down the street screamin'<end_line>
Well I'm sorry, I don't remember<end_line>
All I know is this much, I'm not guilty<end_line>
They said "Save it, boy we got you on tape<end_line>
Yellin' at an old lady"<end_line>
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down<end_line>
It's real intense, no one makes a sound<end_line>
Everything looks like it's "8 Mile" now<end_line>
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves<end_line>
Now snap back to reality, look it's B. Rabbit<end_line>
Oh you signed me up to battle? I'm a grown man<end_line>
Tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba<end_line>
I don't have any lines to go right here so tubba<end_line>
Tellytubby fellasfellas<end_line>
Grab your left nut, make your right one jealous<end_line>
Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls<end_line>
Tall girls, small girls, I'm callin' all girls<end_line>
Everyone report to the dance floor<end_line>
It's your chance for a little romance or butt squeezin'<end_line>
It's the season, just go<end_line>
It's so appeasin'<end_line>
<verse_end>
