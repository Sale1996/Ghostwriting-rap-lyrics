<verse_start>
And I started from the bottom like a, snowman, ground up<end_line>
like round chuck, and still put hands on you, stayin wound up<end_line>
is how I spend timesucker free, confidence high<end_line>
Such a breeze when I pen rhymes, I just got the air about me, like wind chimes<end_line>
Another day in the lifeused to have to scrape to get by<end_line>
Now my community's gated and I made it and my neighbors say hi<end_line>
I'm givin 'em poundsI'm upscale now<end_line>
Guess it means I'm way in the sky<end_line>
But I still remember the days of, minimum wage for, general labor<end_line>
Welfare recipient since a minor, look at how government assistance has major/made ya<end_line>
Adversity, if at first you don't succeed, put your temper to more use<end_line>
cause, bein broke's a poor excuse<end_line>
That should only give you more fuel, show 'em why you're you<end_line>
So close, God it's like I, almost got it, but close only counts in time bombs and horseshoes<end_line>
So I Unabomb shitno remorsescrew it, I'm lit<end_line>
And that attitude, I blew up on quick<end_line>
That's why they call me firecracker, I grew up on WICwith a short fuse!<end_line>
... I got some important news to report to<end_line>
Anyone who thought I was done, nah bitch, not quite<end_line>
Spotlight's back on, got my faith, where's yours?<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Man I know sometimes, these thoughts can, be harsh and cold as ice<end_line>
To me they're just ink blots, I just fling 'em like slingshots and so precise<end_line>
So you might wanna think it over twice, when you retards can roll the dice<end_line>
But beef will at least cost you your career cause even my cheap shots are overpriced<end_line>
... But this middle finger's free as a bird<end_line>
Nuke warhead-ed, birth, hugest forehead on, Earth<end_line>
Too short for the, verse, studied, his formula, learned<end_line>
how to, incorporate a, curse, point it, towards corporate A-merica!<end_line>
Stick a fork in and, turn cause four-letter, words are, more better, heard<end_line>
The world force-fed a, turd, to me, you're getting yours!<end_line>
.. But sometimes I overdo it<end_line>
But I just get so into it, I was there consoling you when no one knew it<end_line>
When your situation showed no improvement, I was that door, you walked over to it<end_line>
I'm the light at the end of tunnel so people are always lookin at me as they're goin through it<end_line>
When that tunnel vision is unclear shit becomes too much to bear<end_line>
Since "Cleanin' Out My Closet" when I was havin trouble with the snare<end_line>
I'm that unrealistic prayer, answered<end_line>
And I'ma get you jackedlike you're tryna fix a flatwhen you struggle with despair<end_line>
That double-fisted, bare-knuckles coupled with this pair<end_line>
of nuts I'm cuppin, I am your fuckin switch, nothin can compare<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Started from the, bottom like a, snowman<end_line>
Oh man, put that in your, corncob pipe and, smoke that<end_line>
But my battery's low, I'ma need a boost to my pack<end_line>
And I know that I always got Proof at my back, I called you "Proof" because I knew for a fact<end_line>
My ace in the hole - homie I'm callin on you<end_line>
cause I think I'm slowly startin to, lose faith in it so, give me that apron and mo-<end_line>
-tivation to go, Hussein with the flow, fake fans left you two-faced at the show<end_line>
Let heartbeats loop, produce hate in my soul, layin vocals two days in a row<end_line>
True statement, hate to go down this road but there's only one route to cross this bridge<end_line>
So I walk in this bitch with loose change cause all my dues paid but this booth's takin its toll<end_line>
But it's never, too late to start a new beginnin<end_line>
That goes for you too, so what the fuck you gon' do? Use the tools you're given!<end_line>
Or you're gon' use the cards you're dealt as an excuse for you to not do shit with 'em?<end_line>
I used to play the loser victim, 'til I saw the way Proof was driven<end_line>
I found my vehicle and I haven't ran out of gas yet<end_line>
And when they stacked decks, turn handicaps into assets, fanny packs, hourglasses<end_line>
If time was on my side I'd still have none to waste<end_line>
Man, in my younger days, that dream was so much fun to chase<end_line>
It's like I run in place while this shit dangled in front of my face<end_line>
But how do you keep up the pace and the hunger pains once you've won the race?<end_line>
When that duel exhaust is coolin off cause you don't got nothin left to prove at all<end_line>
Cause you done already hit 'em with the coup de gr√¢ce<end_line>
Still you feel the NEED, to go full tilt, that Bruce Willis, that "Blue Steel"<end_line>
That true skill, when that wheel's loose, I won't lose will<end_line>
Do you still BELIEVE?<end_line>
