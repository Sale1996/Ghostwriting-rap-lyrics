Yeah, I'm a fuckin kamikaze crashin into everything<end_line>
You beat me, Islamic Nazi, that means there is no such thing<end_line>
I've been goin for your jugular since Craig G "Duck Alert"<end_line>
Wedgie in my underwear, the whole bed sheet and the comforter<end_line>
Stuck up in my rectal crack, kiss my disrespectful ass<end_line>
I'll ride through your cul-de-sac, window cracked, bumpin your reference tracks<end_line>
You-you collaborative effort rap, I-I have never said his raps<end_line>
O-overstayed my welcome, stepped in crap and ruined your welcome mat<end_line>
So spit that shit from the heart, you didn't write like you wrote it<end_line>
While I teabag the microphone cause I go nuts on it<end_line>
Like a fighter jet lined with explosives that'll strike any moment<end_line>
Headed right at opponents and I'm the fuckin pilot that flown it<end_line>
I'm 'bout to<end_line>
<verse_end>

I turned to rap cause it made me feel tough when I wasn't<end_line>
From the moment I heard rap was cussin, I was in<end_line>
Which is why I identify with the guy who I was invented by, Dre's Frankenstein<end_line>
Energized like a 9-volt, ice cold like snake eyes twice in a row on a dice roll<end_line>
But if the only reason I blowed is cause I'm white though<end_line>
Why don't every other white rapper sell what I sold?<end_line>
Kamikaze pilot, I wrote my suicide note, here come the guys in white coats<end_line>
tryin to stop me 'fore I jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes<end_line>
Cause I'm takin y'all with me when I go cyclone, I don't think this typhoon's<end_line>
letting up any time soon, here I go, eyes closed, blindfolded<end_line>
I'm 'bout to<end_line>
<verse_end>

I heard your freestyle on Shade 45, that shit was embarrassing<end_line>
There is no way we ever air that shit again, I guarantee<end_line>
That way that shit was so ass, it's somethin we wouldn't derrier/dare re-air<end_line>
And that shit's embarrassing as me rear-ending Tara Reid bare<end_line>
In my therapy chair, my dick is the hair length of Cher<end_line>
Each nut is the chair width of an acorn, stairlift beware of me<end_line>
Lyrically I'm terrible, better get your lyrics prepared<end_line>
Richard Ramirez is here, serial killin every beat there is<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Wait, wait, got the eeriest feelin<end_line>
Somethin evil is lurkin, I'm no conspiracy theorist<end_line>
But somethin here is afoot - oh yeah, it's my dick<end_line>
Get the measurin stick12 inches of wood!<end_line>
Wait, but I've been goin for your jugular since Craig G "Duck Alert"<end_line>
And I've come to pay respects cause if you sleep you're fucked, other words<end_line>
You get laid to rest, and I hope your butt is hurt<end_line>
Put me on a track I go cray-on it like a color book<end_line>
You got some +Views+, but you're still below me<end_line>
Mine are higher, so when you compare our views, you get overlooked<end_line>
And I don't say the hook unless I wrote the hook<end_line>
And now I'm just freestylin in the vocal booth<end_line>
And you know I've always spoke the truth<end_line>
You lyin through your teeth so much you broke a tooth<end_line>
And it ain't somethin I need a phone to do<end_line>
When I say I can't wait 'til I get ahold of you<end_line>
And I don't know what I'm s'posed to do<end_line>
Line up the rappers, take my pic like a photo shoot<end_line>
