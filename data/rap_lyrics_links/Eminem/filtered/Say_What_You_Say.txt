<verse_start>
I was born to brew up storms and stir up shit<end_line>
Kick up dust, CUSS 'til I slur up spit<end_line>
Grew up - too quick went through too much do too much shit<end_line>
Corrupt, and I'm a pour it on like syrup bitch!<end_line>
Thick and rich, sick and twisted, Mr. Buttersworth<end_line>
Dre told me to milk the shit for what it's worth<end_line>
'til the cow just tilts and tips and stumbles to earth<end_line>
And if I fumble the verse, keep goin<end_line>
First take, I make mistakes, just keep it<end_line>
No punches pulled no punches that's weak shit<end_line>
Fake shit, if I ever take shit I'll EAT shit<end_line>
Wasn't for him, wouldn't be shit<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Second verse, it gets worse, it gets no better than this<end_line>
Amateurs drink veteran piss<end_line>
from a Dixie Cup, if you ever mix me up<end_line>
or CONFUSE ME with a Canibus or Dre with a DUPRI!<end_line>
We'll rub it in, every club you're in will have you<end_line>
blackballed and make sure you never rap a-fuckin-gain<end_line>
Dre ain't havin it; long as I'm here to play Devil's Advocate<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
And I'ma only sucka punch and swing without warning<end_line>
And swing to knock somebody's fuckin head off<end_line>
Cause I know if they get up I won't get a chance to let off<end_line>
Another punch I'm punk rock, no one's punk<end_line>
Don't give a FUCK!  White 'Pac, so much spunk<end_line>
When I was little I knew I would blow up and sell a mill'<end_line>
and grow up, to be Atilla, go nuts and be a pillar<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Heh, like my old lady<end_line>
Cause what you say is what you say, sometimes what you mean<end_line>
is two different things, dependin on your mood if it swings<end_line>
Think too many things<end_line>
Little hit of Dre's weed, I can do anything<end_line>
Catch a contact then I'm gone and I'm back<end_line>
I speed right; and my looseleaf's my launchpad<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
And it's back and forth all day like Red and Meth<end_line>
I joke when I say I'm best<end_line>
in the booth, but a lot of truth is said in jest<end_line>
And if I ever do live to be a legend<end_line>
I'ma die a sudden death<end_line>
Five mics in The Source?  Ain't holdin my fuckin breath<end_line>
But I'll suffocate for the respect<end_line>
'fore I'll breathe to collect a fuckin check<end_line>
<verse_end>
