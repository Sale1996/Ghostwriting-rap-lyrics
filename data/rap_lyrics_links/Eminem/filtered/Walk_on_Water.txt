<verse_start>
Fuck it<end_line>
Why, are expectations so high?<end_line>
Is it the bar I set? My arms I stretch<end_line>
But I can't reach, a far cry from it<end_line>
Or it's in my grasp but as, soon as I grab, squeeze<end_line>
I lose my grip, like the flyin trapeze<end_line>
Into the dark I plummet<end_line>
Now the sky's blackening, I know the mark's high, butter-<end_line>
-flies rip apart my stomach<end_line>
Knowin that no matter what bars I come with<end_line>
you're gonna harp, gripe and<end_line>
That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these<end_line>
As pressure, increases, like khakis<end_line>
I feel the ice cracking<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
It's the curse of the standard, that the first of the "Mathers" discs set<end_line>
Always in search of the verse that I haven't spit yet<end_line>
Will this step, just be another misstep<end_line>
to tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect<end_line>
... I've garnered?<end_line>
The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless<end_line>
And it always feels like I'm hittin the mark<end_line>
'til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart<end_line>
Like, "This shit is garbage"<end_line>
God's given me all this, still I feel no different regardless<end_line>
Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded<end_line>
If only they knew, it's a facade and it's exhaustive<end_line>
And I try not to listen to nonsense<end_line>
But if you bitches are tryin to strip me of my confidence, mission accomplished<end_line>
I'm not God-sent, Nas, Rakim<end_line>
'Pac, Big, James Todd Smith and I'm not Prince<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
It's true, I'm a Rubik's, a beautiful mess<end_line>
At times juvenile yes, I goof and I jest<end_line>
... A flawed human I guess<end_line>
But I'm doin my best, to not ruin your ex-<end_line>
-pectations and meet 'em but first<end_line>
the "Speedom" verse, now Big Sean<end_line>
"He's goin too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?"<end_line>
There was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin out my palm<end_line>
Every album's song, I was spazzin the fuck out on<end_line>
And now I'm gettin clowned and frowned on<end_line>
But the only one who's lookin down on me that matters, now's DeShaun<end_line>
Am I lucky to be around this long?<end_line>
... Begs the question though<end_line>
Especially after the methadone<end_line>
As yesterday fades, and the Dresden home<end_line>
is burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawn<end_line>
The crowds are gone, and it's time to wash out the blonde<end_line>
Sales decline, the curtain's drawn<end_line>
They're closin the set, I'm still pokin my head from out behind<end_line>
And everyone who has doubt, remind<end_line>
Now take your best rhyme<end_line>
Outdo it, now do it a thousand times<end_line>
Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares<end_line>
or gives a fuck about your rhymes<end_line>
And as I grow outta sight, outta mind<end_line>
I might go outta mine, cause how do I<end_line>
ever let this mic go without a fight<end_line>
when I made a fuckin tightrope outta twine?<end_line>
... But when I do fall<end_line>
from these heights though I'll be fine<end_line>
I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine<end_line>
But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time<end_line>
around cause<end_line>
<verse_end>
