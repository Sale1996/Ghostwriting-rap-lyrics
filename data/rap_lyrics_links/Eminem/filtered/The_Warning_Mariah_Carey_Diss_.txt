Sit back homie relax, in fact grab a six-pack<end_line>
Kick back while I kick facts, yeah Dre, sick track<end_line>
Perfect way to get back, wanna hear somethin wick-wack?<end_line>
I got the same exact tat that's on Nick's back<end_line>
I'm +Obsessed+ now, oh gee<end_line>
Is that supposed to be me, in the video with the goatee?<end_line>
Wow Mariah, didn't expect you to go balls out<end_line>
Bitch shut the fuck up 'fore I put all them phone calls out<end_line>
you made to my house when you was +Wild'n Out+<end_line>
before Nick, when you was on my dick and give you somethin to smile about<end_line>
How many times you fly to my house, still tryin to count<end_line>
Better shut your lyin mouth if you don't want Nick findin out<end_line>
You probably think cause it's been so long<end_line>
if I had somethin on you I woulda did it by now<end_line>
Oh on the contrary Mary Poppins I'm mixin our studio session down<end_line>
and sendin it to masterin to make it loud<end_line>
Enough dirt on you to murder you<end_line>
This is what the fuck I do, Mariah it ever occur to you<end_line>
that I still have pictures? However you prefer to do<end_line>
and that goes for Nick too, faggot you think I'm scurred of you?<end_line>
You're gonna ruin my career you better get one<end_line>
Like I'ma sit and fight with you over some slut bitch cunt<end_line>
that made me put up with her psycho ass over six months<end_line>
And only spread her legs to let me hit once<end_line>
Yeah, what you gonna say I'm lucky?<end_line>
Tell the public that I was so ugly that you fuckin had to be drunk to fuck me?<end_line>
Second base, what the fuck you tell Nick pumpkin?<end_line>
The second week we were dry humpin, that's gotta count for somethin<end_line>
Listen girly, surely you don't want me to talk about how I nutted early<end_line>
cause I ejaculated prematurely<end_line>
And bust all over your belly and you almost started hurling<end_line>
and said I was gross, go get a towel, your stomach's curling<end_line>
Or maybe you do, but if I'm embarrassin me I'm embarrassin you<end_line>
And don't you dare say it isn't true<end_line>
As long as that song's gettin airplay I'm dissin you<end_line>
I'm a hair away from gettin carried away and gettin sued<end_line>
I was gonna stop at 16, that was 32<end_line>
This is 34 bars, we ain't even third of the way through<end_line>
"Damn Slim, Mariah play you," Mariah who?<end_line>
Oh, did I say whore Nick? I meant a liar too<end_line>
Like I've been goin off on you all this time<end_line>
for no reason, girl you out your alcoholic mind<end_line>
Check your wine cellar, look at the amounts of all the wine<end_line>
Like I fuckin sit around and think about you all the time<end_line>
I just think this shit is funny when I pounce you on a rhyme<end_line>
But fuck it now I'm 'bout to draw the line<end_line>
And for you to cross it that's a mountain that I doubt you wanna climb<end_line>
I can describe areas of your house you wouldn't find<end_line>
on an episode of "Cribs," a blow below the ribs<end_line>
If I hear another word so don't go openin your jibs<end_line>
Cause every time you do it's like an overload of fibs<end_line>
I ain't sayin this shit again hoe, you know what it is<end_line>
It's a warning shot, 'fore I blow up your whole spot<end_line>
Call my bluff and, I'll release every fuckin thing I got<end_line>
Including the voicemails right before you flipped your top<end_line>
when me and Luis were tryin to stick two CD's in the same slot<end_line>
<verse_end>

Let me whisper sweet nothings into your ear boo<end_line>
Now what you say?Yeah so what I'll do<end_line>
