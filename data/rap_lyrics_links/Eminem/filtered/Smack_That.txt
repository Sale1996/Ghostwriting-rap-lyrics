I see the one, because she be that lady! Hey!<end_line>
I feel you creeping on, I can see from my shadow<end_line>
Wanna jump up in my Lamborghini Gallardo<end_line>
Maybe go to my place and just kick it like TaeBo<end_line>
And possibly bend you over look back and watch me<end_line>

Upfront style ready to attack now<end_line>
Pull in the parking lot slow with the lac down<end_line>
Convicts got the whole thing packed now<end_line>
Step in the club now and wardrobe intact now!<end_line>
I feel it down and cracked now<end_line>
I see it dull and backed now<end_line>
I'm gonna call her, than I pull the mack down<end_line>
Money no problem, pocket full of that now!<end_line>
<verse_end>

Get a lil drink on<end_line>
They gonna flip for this Akon shit<end_line>
You can bank on it!<end_line>
Pedicure medicure kitty-cat claws<end_line>
The way she climbs up and down them poles<end_line>
Looking like one of them putty-cat dolls<end_line>
Trying to hold my woodie back through my draws<end_line>
Steps upstage didn't think I saw<end_line>
Creeps up behind me, shes like "yoo"<end_line>
I'm like ya I know lets cut to the chase<end_line>
No time to waste back to my place<end_line>
Plus from the club to the crib it's like a mile away<end_line>
Or more like a palace, shall I say<end_line>
Plus I got pal if your gal is game<end_line>
In fact he is the one singing the song that's playing<end_line>
<verse_end>

Eminem is rollin', d and 'em rollin' bo<end_line>
And all marvelous them rolling<end_line>
Women just holding big booty rollin'<end_line>
Soon I'll be on Eminem throwing "D!"<end_line>
Hitting on less than "Three!"<end_line>
Block wheel style like "Whee!"<end_line>
Girl I can tell you want me because lately<end_line>
