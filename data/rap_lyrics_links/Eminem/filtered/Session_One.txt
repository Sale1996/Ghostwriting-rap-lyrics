<verse_start>
Now I ain't back just for the sake of just sayin I'm back<end_line>
I could relax but I'd rather stack ammo on tracks<end_line>
Couple Xanax, light a couple wax candles then black<end_line>
out and relapse 'til I yack Jack Daniel's and 'gnac<end_line>
Burp bubbles, attitude's immaturin<end_line>
Double shot of Bacardi, party, vision is blurrin - whoa-oh!<end_line>
I can't see shit, my words get to slurrin, uh-oh!<end_line>
You can call me R. Kelly now, urine/you're in, trouble!<end_line>

has no bearing on the bad news I'm baring, whoa<end_line>
What is it, wordplay? No I'm pushin you out the do'<end_line>
So suck my dick on the couch if you wanna cushion the blow<end_line>

It's pandemo-nium, standin O when you see him, oh<end_line>
Damn baby you look good, you're givin me wood<end_line>
You should, pull over like a sweat-shirt with a hood<end_line>
Let's network, get our polly on, you and me both<end_line>
Break bread while I'm coppin over this game to pinch a loaf<end_line>
Now homie who's your favorite pain in the ass?<end_line>
Who claims to be spittin the same flames as me? I'm Kanye when he crashed<end_line>
In other words I got the hood on smash like I stepped on the gas<end_line>
Destroyed the front end, deployed the damn airbags from the dash<end_line>
Went through 'em and laughed<end_line>
Came back an hour after the accident and bit a goddamn Jawbreaker in half!<end_line>
So stop fakin the funk and start shakin your ass<end_line>
Slaughterhouse in the house with the Caucasian of rap<end_line>
and Just Blaze on the track, what's the fuck's more amazin than that?<end_line>
Slut, answer me that, Royce where you at?<end_line>
