<verse_start>
Hand me an .8, beam me up and land me in space <end_line>
I'ma sit on top of the worldand shit on Brandy and Mase<end_line>
I'm more than ill<end_line>
I'm scarier than a white journalist in a room with Lauryn Hill<end_line>
Human horror film<end_line>
but with a lot funnier plot, and people that feel me<end_line>
cause I'ma still be Madd Rapper, whether I got money or not<end_line>
As long as I'm on pills, and I got plenty of pot<end_line>
I'll be in a canoe paddlin, makin fun of your yacht<end_line>
But I would like an award <end_line>
for the best rapper to get one mic in The Source<end_line>
and a wardrobe I can afford<end_line>
Otherwise I might get sent up back-strike in a Ford<end_line>
And you wonder what the fuck I need more Vicadin for<end_line>
Everybody's pissin' me off; even the No Limit Tank <end_line>
looks like a middle finger sideways flippin me off<end_line>
No shit I'm a great danger to my health <end_line>
Why else would I kill you then jump in the grave and bury myself?<end_line>

I'm the illest rapper to hold the cordless, patrollin corners<end_line>
Looking for hookers to punch in the mouth with a roll of quarters<end_line>
I'm meaner in action than Roscoe beatin James Todd Sr.<end_line>
across the back with vacuum cleaner attachments<end_line>
I grew up in a wild hood, as a hazardous youth<end_line>
with a fucked up childhood, that I used as an excuse<end_line>
And ain't shit changed, I kept the same mindstate<end_line>
since the third time that I failed 9th grade<end_line>
You probably think that I'm a negative person, don't be so sure of it<end_line>
I don't promote violence, I just encourage it<end_line>
I laugh at the sight of death<end_line>
as I fall down a cement flight of steps<end_line>
and land inside a bed of spider webs<end_line>
So throw caution to the wind; you and a friend<end_line>
can jump off of a bridge and if you live, do it again<end_line>
Shit, why not, blow your brain out, I'm blowin mine out<end_line>
Fuck it, you only live once, you might as well die now!<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
My laser disc gon' make you take a razor to your wrist<end_line>
Make you satanistic, make you take the pistol to your face <end_line>
and place the clip and cock it back<end_line>
and let it go until your brains are rippin out <end_line>
your skull so bad to sew you back would be a waste of stitches<end_line>
I'm not a "Role Model," I don't wanna babysit kids<end_line>
I got one little girl, and Hailey Jade is Shady's business<end_line>
And Shady's just an alias I made to make you pissed off<end_line>
Where the fuck were you when Gil was paid to make me dishwash?<end_line>
I make a couple statements and now look how crazy shit got<end_line>
You made me get a bigger attitude than eighty Kim Scott's<end_line>
And she almost got the same fate that Grady's bitch got<end_line>
I knew that "Just the Two of Us" would make you hate me this much<end_line>
And "Just the Two of Us," that ain't got shit to do with us <end_line>
and our personal life, it's just words on a mic<end_line>
So you can call me a punk, a pervert or a chauvinist pig<end_line>
But the funny shit is that I still go with the bitch!<end_line>
<verse_end>
