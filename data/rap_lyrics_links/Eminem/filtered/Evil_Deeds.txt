Momma had a baby and it's head popped off (head popped off<end_line>
head popped off, head popped off, head popped off, head popped off)<end_line>
My momma don't want me the next thing I know I'm gettin dropped off<end_line>
Ring ring ring on the door bell and the next door neighbors on their front porch<end_line>
But they didn't want me neither so they left me on someone else's lawn<end_line>
'til somebody finally took me in<end_line>
My Great Aunt and Uncle, Edna 'n Charles (Edna 'n Charles<end_line>
Edna 'n Charles, Edna 'n Charles, Edna 'n Charles)<end_line>
They were the ones who were left in charge<end_line>
My elementary they gang up on me and sang this song<end_line>
It went a little somethin like<end_line>
Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb<end_line>
Debbie had a Satan spawn, Satan spawn<end_line>
Momma why do they keep saying this I just don't understand, understand<end_line>
And by the way, where's my daaaaaaaaaaad?<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Predominantly, predominantly, everything's always predominantly<end_line>
Predominantly white, predominantly black, but what about me<end_line>
where does that leave me?  Well I guess that I'm between predominantly<end_line>
both of 'em, I think if I hear that fuckin word again I'ma scream<end_line>
While I'm projectile vomiting, what do I look like, a comedian to you?<end_line>
Do you think that I'm kidding?  What do I look like some kind of idi-<end_line>
wait a minute, shit, don't answer that - why am I so misunderstood?<end_line>
Why do I go through so much bullshit, it sucks bullshit, it's tush mull bish<end_line>
Woe is me, there goes poor Marshall again whinin about his millions <end_line>
nd his mansion and his sorrow he's always drownin in<end_line>
From the dad he never had, and how his childhood was so bad<end_line>
And how his mom was a dope addict, and his ex-wife how they go at it<end_line>
Man I'd hate to have it, as bad as that Mr. Mathers, claims he had it<end_line>
I can't imagine it, that little rich poor white bastard<end_line>
needs to take some of that cash out the bank and take a bath in it<end_line>
Man if I only had half of it<end_line>
Shit, if you only knew the half of it<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Evil deeds, while I plant these evil seeds<end_line>
Please release me from these demons<end_line>
I never had any of this shit planned mom, please believe<end_line>
I don't wanna be Satan's spawn, never got the chance to say I'm sorry<end_line>
Now look at all the pain I caused<end_line>
Dear Santa Claus, why you not comin this year again?<end_line>
What did I do that was so bad to deserve this?<end_line>
Everything could have been so perfect<end_line>
But life ain't a fairytale, I'm about to be hoist up in the air<end_line>
Forty feet below me, there's people everywhere<end_line>
I don't even know what it feel like, they know me cause I'm in this ferris wheel<end_line>
And all I wanna do is go to the mall and take Hailie on the carousel<end_line>
Without this crowd everywhere I go, but life is like a merry-go-round<end_line>
Here we go now, doe-se-doe now, curtains up, the show must go<end_line>
Now ring around the rosie, the show's over, you can all go home now<end_line>
But the curtain just don't close for me, this ain't how fame is supposed to be<end_line>
Where's the switch I could just turn off and on, this ain't what I chose to be<end_line>
So please God, give me the strength to have what it takes to carry on<end_line>
'til I pass 50 back the baton, the camera's on, my soul is gone<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
That's him baby, let's go<end_line>
<verse_end>
