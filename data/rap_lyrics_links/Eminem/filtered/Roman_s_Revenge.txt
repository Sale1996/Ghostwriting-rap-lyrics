<verse_start>
I ain't into S&M, but my whip's off the chain<end_line>
A little drop of candy paint drips off the frame<end_line>
Twisted-ass mind got a pretzel for a brain<end_line>
An eraser for a head, fuckin pencil for a frame!<end_line>
You don't like it then peel off bitch<end_line>
Every last woman on Earth I'll kill off<end_line>
And I still wouldn't fuck you slut so wipe the smile on your grill off<end_line>
I swear to God I'll piss a Happy Meal off<end_line>
Get the wheels turnin, spin the wheel off<end_line>
Snap the axle in half, bust the tie rod<end_line>
Quit hollerin "Why God?" He ain't got shit to do with it, bygones<end_line>
will never be bygones, so won't be finished swallowin my wad<end_line>
I ain't finished blowin it, nice bra<end_line>
Hope it'll fit a tough titty bitch, life's hard<end_line>
I swear to God life is a dumb blond white broad<end_line>
with fake tits and a bad dye job<end_line>
who just spit in my fuckin face and called me a fuckin tightwad<end_line>
So finally I broke down and bought her an iPod<end_line>
and caught her stealin my music, so I tied her arms<end_line>
and legs to the bed, set up the camera and pissed twice on her<end_line>
Look, two pees and a tripod!<end_line>
The moral to the story is life's treatin you like dry sod<end_line>
Kick it back in its face, my God<end_line>
It's Shady and Nicki Minaj, you might find the sight quite odd<end_line>
But don't ask why bitch<end_line>
The world, world, is my punchin bag and<end_line>
If I'm, garbage you're a bunch of maggots<end_line>
Make that face, go on scrunch it up at me<end_line>
Show me the target so I can lunge and attack it!<end_line>
Like alike a dungeon dragon<end_line>
You fell off, off, they musta bumped your wagon<end_line>
You musta went off the back, I'm 'bout to go off the deep end<end_line>
Told you to stay in your lane, you just jumped in traffic<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Wa, wa, wa, wa, wa-wa-wa-wa-wa<end_line>
All you lil' faggots can suck it<end_line>
No homo but I'ma stick it to 'em like refrigerator magnets<end_line>
And I'm crooked enough to make strait-jackets BEND<end_line>
Yeah, look who's back again bitch, keep actin as if<end_line>
you have the same passion I have<end_line>
Yeah right, still hungry my ass, you ass-dicks had gastric bypass<end_line>
Ain't hot enough to set fire to dry grass<end_line>
And 'bout as violent as hair on eyelids<end_line>
Go take a flying leap of faith off a fuckin balcony<end_line>
'fore I shove a falcon wing up your fly ass<end_line>
You know what time it is so why ask?<end_line>
When Shady and Nicki's world's clash whenmeets<end_line>
<verse_end>
