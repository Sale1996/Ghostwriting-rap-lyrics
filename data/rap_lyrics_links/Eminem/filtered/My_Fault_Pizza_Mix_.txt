I went to John's rave with Ron and Dave<end_line>
And met a new wave blonde babe with half of her head shaved<end_line>
A nurse aid who came to get laid and tied up<end_line>
with first aid tape and raped on the first date<end_line>
Susan -- an ex-manic depressive who just moved from Houston<end_line>
who love booze and alternative music<end_line>
Told me she was starvin, I said it wasn't a problem<end_line>
I got a coupon for this pizza with everything on it<end_line>
We can double the mushrooms and minus the sausage<end_line>
I'm allergic to fungus <end_line>
Come on Sue, that's nonsense<end_line>
Who's at the door??  Pizza man!<end_line>
Who ordered pizza?  Wasn't it yours?  Nuh uh<end_line>
If you got it with double mushrooms on it then I don't want it<end_line>
Shutup Susan I'll pick em off it<end_line>
Oh hell, I might as well try it, I'll be alright<end_line>
Susan you just swallowed the wrong slice!!<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
"Yo Sue!"<end_line>
Get away from me, I don't know you<end_line>
Oh shoot, she's tripping..<end_line>
I need to go puke!! <end_line>
I wasn't tryin to turn this into somethin major<end_line>
I just wanted to make you appreciate flavor<end_line>
Susan, stop cryin, I don't hate ya<end_line>
I'm sorry your father used to chase you and spank you with hangers<end_line>
So what they locked you in the attic in your dad's house?<end_line>
That ain't no reason to start wiggin and spaz out<end_line>
She said,<end_line>
Help me I think I'm havin a seisure!<end_line>
I said, "You're breaking out in hives, let go of the pizza!"<end_line>
"Would you put it down you're startin to scare me"<end_line>
She said,<end_line>
I'm twenty-six years old and I'm not married<end_line>
    I don't even have any kids and I can't cook<end_line>
I'm over here Sue,you're talkin to the plant, look!<end_line>
We need to get to a hospital 'fore it's too late <end_line>
Cause I never seen no-one eat as many shrooms as you ate<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
My God, I'm so sorry!<end_line>
I'm so sorry!  Susan please wake up!<end_line>
Please!  Please wake up!!  What are you doing?!<end_line>
You're not dead!!  You're NOT dead!<end_line>
I know you're not dead!<end_line>
