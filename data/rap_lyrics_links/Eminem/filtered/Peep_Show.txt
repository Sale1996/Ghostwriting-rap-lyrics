<verse_start>
Come to me now, you don't come to me now<end_line>
Apple in your mouth, tackled on the couch<end_line>
Shackled in the house, I'll be back in about<end_line>
20 minutes or less, with my Hannibal mask<end_line>
So when you wiggle around and giggle in that cage<end_line>
I knew I couldn't wait to get you off that stage<end_line>
From the moment I met you had to let you know<end_line>
I just wanted to get you through my bedroom do'<end_line>
You makin me feel like I'm in middle school still<end_line>
You squeal like a little girl, you're pitiful, chill<end_line>
We gon' fuck, I just popped this little blue pill<end_line>
You can leave but wait, I gotta shit on you still<end_line>
I shouldn't have to say it shorty you should know<end_line>
I hope you really gettin into my creep show<end_line>
Let me shit on your chest and if some pee comes out<end_line>
Just guzzle it down, just guzzle it down<end_line>
<verse_end>
