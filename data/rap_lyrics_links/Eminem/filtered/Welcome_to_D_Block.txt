Welcome to D Block, the might mighty D Block<end_line>
A place in New York City where Diddy won't even walk<end_line>
Its D Block, the part of yonder where I wouldnt be caught<end_line>
Without two pistols on me that'll be cocked in each pocket<end_line>
D Block don't even stop to talk, you just keep walkin<end_line>
Stick up kids every block who walks with that free op-<end_line>
-Portunity, as soon as you leave out that jewelry shop<end_line>
And you won't even notice your mind will be so preo-<end_line>
-Ccupied on that new watch you just copped<end_line>
You won't even see that ride pull up along side you<end_line>
You'll be shot fore you even realize you were spied over three blocks<end_line>
D Block the place where gees get knocked, locked up<end_line>
Get out come home for a week and get re-knocked<end_line>
You don't even see cops, hiphop police don't even stop<end_line>
On D Block, where everybody wants to be Pac<end_line>
And you can get popped over the new G Unit reboks<end_line>
