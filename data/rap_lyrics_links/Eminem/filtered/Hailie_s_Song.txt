Yo, I can't sing - I feel like singing<end_line>
I want to fuckin sing<end_line>
Cause I'm happy - yeah, I'm happy, haha!<end_line>
I got my baby back<end_line>
Yo, check it out...<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Somedays I sit, starin out the window<end_line>
Watchin this world pass me by<end_line>
Sometimes I think, there's nothin to live for<end_line>
I almost break down and cry<end_line>
Sometimes I think I'm crazy; I'm crazy, oh so crazy!!<end_line>
Why am I here? Am I just wastin my time?!<end_line>
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy!!<end_line>
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
My baby girl, keeps gettin older<end_line>
I watch her grow up with pride<end_line>
People make jokes, cause they don't understand me<end_line>
They just don't see my real side<end_line>
I act like shit don't phase me; inside it drives me crazy!!<end_line>
My insecurities could eat me alive<end_line>
But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy!!<end_line>
It all makes sense when I look into her eyes<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Man if I could sing, I'd keep singin this song to my daughter<end_line>
If I could hit the notes, I'd blow somethin as long as my father<end_line>
to show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her<end_line>
God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't<end_line>
Now you probably get this picture from my public persona<end_line>
that I'ma pistol packin drug addict who bags on his mama<end_line>
But I wanna to just take this time out to be perfectly honest<end_line>
cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled that hurts deep inside of my soul<end_line>
And just know that I grow colder the older I grow<end_line>
This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold<end_line>
and this load is like the weight of the world, and I think my neck is breakin<end_line>
Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations?<end_line>
Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself<end_line>
but I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin hell<end_line>
But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt<end_line>
So many chances, man, it's too bad, coulda had someone else<end_line>
But the years that I've wasted is nothin to the tears that I've tasted<end_line>
So here's what I'm facin - three felonies, six years of probation<end_line>
I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman<end_line>
I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman<end_line>
Man, I should have seen it comin, what'd I stick my penis up in?<end_line>
Wouldn't have ripped the pre-nup up if I'da seen what she was fuckin<end_line>
But fuck it, it's over, there's no more reason to cry no more<end_line>
I got my baby, baby the only lady that I adore, Hailie<end_line>
So sayonara, try tommorrow, nice to know ya<end_line>
Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner<end_line>
And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted<end_line>
It's like the greatest gift you can get, the weight has been lifted<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Wooo! Told you I can't sing<end_line>
Oh well, I tried<end_line>
Hailie, remember when I said, if you ever need anything<end_line>
Daddy would be right there? Guess what?<end_line>
Daddy's here, and I ain't going nowhere baby<end_line>
I love you<end_line>
<verse_end>
