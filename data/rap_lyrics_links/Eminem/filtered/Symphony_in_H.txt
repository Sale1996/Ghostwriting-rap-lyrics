<verse_start>
Don't ask me what's up with the hoes, I'm still workin the kinks out<end_line>
Love stinks, that explains all this anger that's spillin out<end_line>
And I ain't chillin out<end_line>
Got an Oscar but I'm still a +Grouch+<end_line>
I use it as a doorstop and a prop for the broken leg for the couch<end_line>
Yelawolf, Shady, Tony, Touch, Slaughterhouse<end_line>
Yeah the SWAT team 'bout to break them flyswatters out<end_line>
Go to hell in a drought, break ice waters out<end_line>
Nice try shorty wop, we can window shop, the jewelry store<end_line>
But Christ for that price could've bought a house<end_line>
Besides, only thing I ever had iced out<end_line>
is my heart since I started out!<end_line>
It's F.Y.I. if ya ain't knowin<end_line>
What? Go with you where? Nah, ain't goin<end_line>
Oh wait, you want a date, oh well<end_line>
In that case hoe it's June 8th, OH and<end_line>
Kinda like Beethoven<end_line>
composin a symphony of hate, so much hate woven<end_line>
into these raps, he stitches a bitch, straight sewin<end_line>
Shit I'm beginnin to hate clothing<end_line>
I hate overalls cause they remind me of hoes<end_line>
For Christ's sake, they're shaped like an H, whoa<end_line>
And, you know what else starts with H though?<end_line>
Hockey, shit, thought I had the place flowin<end_line>
I hate to put you on ice<end_line>
But you already had three periods in 60 minutes, great goin<end_line>
Plus you remind me of cocaine, hoe<end_line>
You always in the mirror with your face so<end_line>
I feel an urge to put you all in a line and<end_line>
chop you with a razor blade yo - wait, I'm an a-hole<end_line>
Devil with a halo<end_line>
Hell yeah I'd nail J-Lo, to the railroad~!<end_line>
Say I won't! Better hope you can stay afloat<end_line>
when I take the wind out your sailboat<end_line>
But, I ain't playin yo<end_line>
Dope as Shady? Don't kid yourself, bitch you ain't even a baby goat<end_line>
