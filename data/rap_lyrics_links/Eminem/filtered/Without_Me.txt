I've created a monster, cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more<end_line>
They want Shady, I'm chopped liver<end_line>
Well if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya<end_line>
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor<end_line>
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker<end_line>
than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital<end_line>
by the doctor when I'm not co-operating<end_line>
When I'm rockin the table while he's operating<end_line>
You waited this long, now stop debating<end_line>
Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovu-lating<end_line>
I know that you got a job Ms. Cheney<end_line>
but your husband's heart problem's complicating<end_line>
So the FCC won't let me be<end_line>
or let me be me, so let me see<end_line>
They try to shut me down on MTV<end_line>
But it feels so empty, without me<end_line>
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips<end_line>
Fuck that, cum on your lips, and some on your tits<end_line>
And get ready, cause this shit's about to get heavy<end_line>
I just settled all my lawsuits, FUCK YOU DEBBIE!<end_line>

Little Hellions, kids feelin rebellious<end_line>
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis<end_line>
They start feelin like prisoners helpless<end_line>
'til someone comes along on a mission and yells BITCH!!!<end_line>
A visionary, vision of scary<end_line>
Could start a revolution, pollutin the airwaves<end_line>
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask<end_line>
in the fact that I got everyone kissin my ass<end_line>
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe<end_line>
for you to see so damn much of my ass; you asked for me?<end_line>
Well I'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na<end_line>
Fix your bent antenna tune it in and then I'm gonna<end_line>
enter in, endin up under your skin like a splinter<end_line>
The center of attention, back for the winter<end_line>
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling<end_line>
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting<end_line>
Testing, attention please<end_line>
Feel the tension, soon as someone mentions me<end_line>
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free<end_line>
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?<end_line>

A-tisket a-tasket, I go tit for tat with<end_line>
anybody who's talkin this shit, that shit<end_line>
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked<end_line>
worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards<end_line>
And Moby?  You can get stomped by Obie<end_line>
You thirty-six year old baldheaded fag, blow me<end_line>
You don't know me, you're too old, let go<end_line>
It's over, nobody listen to techno<end_line>
Now let's go, just gimme the signal<end_line>
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults<end_line>
I been dope, suspenseful with a pencil<end_line>
ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol<end_line>
But sometimes the shit just seems<end_line>
everybody only wants to discuss me<end_line>
So this must mean I'm dis-gus-ting<end_line>
But it's just me, I'm just obscene<end_line>
No I'm not the first king of controversy<end_line>
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley<end_line>
to do black music so selfishly<end_line>
and used it to get myself wealthy<end_line>
There's a concept that works<end_line>
Twenty million other white rappers emerge<end_line>
But no matter how many fish in the sea<end_line>
It'll be so empty, without me<end_line>
