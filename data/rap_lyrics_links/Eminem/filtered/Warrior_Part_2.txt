<verse_start>
It's like a throne that he don't even own<end_line>
He won't sit down give him a crown he just throws it around<end_line>
It's like a joke he's like a king but he don't do a thing<end_line>
He don't want the diamonds, want the gold or want the jewelry<end_line>
He don't want the room and he don't want the loot he's in it for the sport<end_line>
Runnin circles 'round his competition on the court<end_line>
He appreciates your support but he ain't beggin for it<end_line>
And you can love and you can hate it<end_line>
but you can't ignore it, you can't be that ignorant<end_line>
But you can try to sell him short<end_line>
But you can't fuck with his last joint or the one before it<end_line>
And he was born to raise hell like them country boys<end_line>
And If I'm frontin then you better come confront me for it<end_line>
<verse_end>
