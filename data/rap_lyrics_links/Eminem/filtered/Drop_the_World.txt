I'm gone... I'm gone, I'm gone<end_line>
It hurts but I never show, this pain you'll never know<end_line>
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold<end_line>
And frostbit I've become, my back's against the wall<end_line>
When push come to shove I just stand up and scream fuck 'em all<end_line>
Man it feels like these walls are closin in, this roof is cavin in<end_line>
Up it's time to raise it then, your days are numbered like pagers and<end_line>
My book of rhymes got 'em cookin boy, this crooked mind of mines <end_line>
got 'em all shook and scared to look in my eyes<end_line>
I stole that fuckin clock I took the time<end_line>
And I, came up from behind and pretty much snuck up and butt-fucked this game up<end_line>
Better be careful when you bring my name up, fuck this fame that ain't what<end_line>
I came to claim but the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it<end_line>
But I swear one way or another I'ma make these fuckin haters believe it<end_line>
I swear to God, won't spare the rod<end_line>
I'm a man of my words so your fuckin heads better nod<end_line>
Or I'ma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody<end_line>
Sleep on me that pillow is where your head'll lie<end_line>
Permanently bitch it's beddy-bye<end_line>
This world is my Easter egg, yeah prepare to die!<end_line>
My head is swole, my confidence is up, this stage is my pedestal<end_line>
I'm unstoppable, incredible, hoe you're trapped in my medicine ball<end_line>
I could run circles around you so fast your fuckin head'll spin dawg<end_line>
I'll split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives<end_line>
I'll fuckin<end_line>
<verse_end>

I'm gone... I'm gone, I'm gone<end_line>
