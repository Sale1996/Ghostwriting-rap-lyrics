<verse_start>
Sometimes I just feel like, quittin I still might<end_line>
Why do I put up this fight, why do I still write<end_line>
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin with real life<end_line>
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics<end_line>
And show these people what my level of skill's like<end_line>
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life<end_line>
Somethin ain't right, hit the brake lights<end_line>
Case of the stage fright, drawin a blank like<end_line>
Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault<end_line>
Great then I falls, my insides crawl<end_line>
and I clam upI just slam shut<end_line>
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's<end_line>
just been stripped, I have just been vicked<end_line>
So I must then get, off the bus then split<end_line>
Man fuck this shit; yo, I'm goin the fuck home<end_line>
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I'm walkin these train tracks, tryin to regain back<end_line>
the spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap<end_line>
To the same plant, and the same pants<end_line>
Tryin to chase rap, gotta move ASAP<end_line>
And get a new plan, momma's got a new man<end_line>
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand<end_line>
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad<end_line>
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand<end_line>
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad<end_line>
Ain't no tellin what really goes on in her little head<end_line>
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had<end_line>
But I keep runnin from somethin I never wanted so bad!<end_line>
Sometimes I get upset, cause I ain't blew up yet<end_line>
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet<end_line>
Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep<end_line>
The pressure's too much man, I'm just tryin to do what's best<end_line>
And I try, sit alone and I cry<end_line>
Yo I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by<end_line>
That I don't pray to the sky, please I'm beggin you God<end_line>
Please don't let me be bitchin holdin no regular job<end_line>
Yo I hope you can hear me homey wherever you are<end_line>
Yo I'm tellin you dawg I'm bailin this trailer tomorrow<end_line>
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye<end_line>
Say whenever you need me baby, I'm never too far<end_line>
But yo I gotta get out there, the only way I know<end_line>
And I'ma be back for you, the second that I blow<end_line>
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own<end_line>
Off to work I go, back to this 8 Mile Road<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
You gotta live it to feel it, you didn't you wouldn't get it<end_line>
Or see what the big deal is, why it was and it still is<end_line>
To be walkin this borderline of Detroit city limits<end_line>
It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate<end_line>
of authenticity, you'd never even see<end_line>
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility<end_line>
You never seen heard smelled or met a real MC<end_line>
who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me<end_line>
But yet I'm still unsigned, havin a rough time<end_line>
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes<end_line>
Go to work and serve MC's in the lunchline<end_line>
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go<end_line>
Who must I show, to bust my flow<end_line>
Where must I go, who must I know<end_line>
Or am I just another crab in the bucket<end_line>
Cause I ain't havin no luck with this little Rabbit so fuck it<end_line>
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin to doubt shit<end_line>
I'm feelin a little skeptical who I hang out with<end_line>
I look like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit<end_line>
if the Salvation Army tryin to salvage an outfit<end_line>
And it's cold, tryin to travel this road<end_line>
Plus I feel like I'm on stuck in this battlin mode<end_line>
My defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want<end_line>
is pity from no one, the city is no fun<end_line>
There is no sun, and it's so dark<end_line>
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein pulled apart<end_line>
from each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends<end_line>
It's enough to make me just wanna jump out of my skin<end_line>
Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not<end_line>
what I'm doin I just blow, my head is a stove top<end_line>
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot<end_line>
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got<end_line>
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn<end_line>
Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned<end_line>
Ain't no fallin no next time I meet a new girl<end_line>
I can no longer play stupid or be immature<end_line>
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage<end_line>
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words<end_line>
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge<end_line>
Suddenly a new burst of energy is occured<end_line>
Time to show these free world leaders the three and a third<end_line>
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird<end_line>
Then I turn and cross over the median curb<end_line>
Hit the verbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road<end_line>
<verse_end>
