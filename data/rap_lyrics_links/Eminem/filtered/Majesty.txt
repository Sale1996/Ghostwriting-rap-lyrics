<verse_start>
She invites me to the condo<end_line>
Uh-oh, wifey's in Chicago<end_line>
My side piece, but she's also<end_line>
someone's wife, so time we spend is borrowed<end_line>
But it's our moment right here, fuck tomorrow<end_line>
Cause moments like these are to die/dye for<end_line>
And she's Clairol, +Nice and Easy+ as hair, when I'm bleaching it blonde so<end_line>
We got that lightning in a bottle<end_line>
... She's tipsy, I'm sober<end_line>
So she gets a chip on her shoulder, sits on the sofa<end_line>
I go to load a Slick Rick song or throw some Souls of Mischief on, she goes<end_line>
"All that old school hip-hop is over; think that shit's got pneumonia"<end_line>
I told her, "Bitch now just hold up!"<end_line>
That's why rap needs a doctor, our genre's lymph nodes are swollen up<end_line>
It's time to check it for strep or some tonsillitis cause like what they swab you with when your throat hurts<end_line>
That's why Tribe is so vital, we need +Q-Tip+ for the culture<end_line>
You ain't dealin with a fuckin featherweight, I used to medicate until I'd get a fuckin bellyache<end_line>
And now I'm finna step on the pedal, don't wanna ever brake, I wanna accelerate to a level that I can elevate<end_line>
Demented with the pen I'll make the motherfucker detonate<end_line>
I wanna make it acapella, wait I gotta set a date<end_line>
with the devil and celebrate<end_line>
together we can renovate and re-develop, hell awaits and I'ma get a special place~!<end_line>
Now, take a ride with me, hop into my time machine<end_line>
I'ma take the driver's seat as I thrust into hyperspeed<end_line>
like I'm a meteorite, and motherfuck the fuckin media right in the<end_line>
behind, I'm a human encyclopedia, I must be<end_line>
like pie crust because I was bread/bred to rise like I was yeast<end_line>
And you're never gonna reach these heights, they're just too high to reach<end_line>
And I ain't even reached my fuckin highest<end_line>
You better, pick another game, try hide-and-seek<end_line>
And you might wanna decide to cheat, cause you gotta open your eyes to peek/peak<end_line>
Am I indeed the last of a dyin breed? Even if you fire-breathe<end_line>
Ain't shit you can say to inspire heat<end_line>
if you wrapped your entire Mead pad up in a dryer sheet<end_line>
And I'm back to rule the kingdom of "fuck it"<end_line>
Better not use me as your topic, anybody who brings me up duck it<end_line>
Let me keep it 100, two things shouldn't be your themes of discussion<end_line>
The queen and her husband, last thing you're gonna wanna be is our subjects, yeah<end_line>
