Hi kids!  Do you like violence? <end_line>
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids? <end_line>
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? <end_line>
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse that my life is? <end_line>
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin to get my head straight<end_line>
but I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate <end_line>
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady you a basehead!"<end_line>
Uh-uhhh!  "So why's your face red?  Man you wasted!"<end_line>
Well since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else<end_line>
Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt<end_line>
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off<end_line>
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross<end_line>
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass<end_line>
faster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast<end_line>
C'mere slut! <end_line>
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off!<end_line>

My English teacher wanted to have sex in junior high<end_line>
The only problem was my English teacher was a guy<end_line>
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler<end_line>
and stapled his nuts to a stack of paper <end_line>
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up<end_line>
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup <end_line>
Extraterrestrial, killin pedestrians<end_line>
Rapin lesbians while they screamin: "LET'S JUST BE FRIENDS!"<end_line>
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to<end_line>
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do<end_line>
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper<end_line>
Make a record about doin drugs and name it after her <end_line>
You know you blew up when the women rush your stands<end_line>
and try to touch your hands like some screamin Usher fans <end_line>
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph <end_line>
So I signed it: 'Dear Dave, thanks for the support, ASSHOLE!'<end_line>

Stop the tape!  This kid needs to be locked away! <end_line>
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, OPERATE!<end_line>
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die<end_line>
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive<end_line>
Am I comin or goin?  I can barely decide<end_line>
I just drank a fifth of vodka -- dare me to drive? <end_line>
All my life I was very deprived<end_line>
I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide<end_line>
Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk <end_line>
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks <end_line>
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits<end_line>
HOW YOU GONNA BREAST FEED ME MOM?  YOU AIN'T GOT NO TITS! <end_line>
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed <end_line>
Put a bulleproof vest on and shoot myself in the head <end_line>
I'm steamin mad <end_line>
And by the way when you see my dad? <end_line>
Tell him that I slit his throat, in this dream I had<end_line>
