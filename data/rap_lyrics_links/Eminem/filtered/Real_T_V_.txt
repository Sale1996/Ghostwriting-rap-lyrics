I tried to come up with a speech that heat seeks<end_line>
In a mans last stand with a heart that beats week<end_line>
Who each week turns on the tube to sneak peek<end_line>
And see the same dude on a screen in repeats<end_line>
Consider every word that I spit<end_line>
Every song on my albums a movie and this is the pilot<end_line>
You're forced to eat rhymes and this a mere chapter of skills<end_line>
And here after you'll feel the FEAR FACTOR<end_line>
A lone diver in flows and more liver in shows<end_line>
With eye of the tiger like SURVIVOR<end_line>
You seen it all before I just inherit the title emcee<end_line>
Now it's me your new AMERICAN IDOL<end_line>
Without all of the bull or me in a seat rhyming<end_line>
I'll fuck Paula Abdul and beat the shit out of Simon<end_line>
I'm not your BIG BROTHER I'm JOE MILLIONAIRE<end_line>
With your bitch throwing hundred dollar bills in the air<end_line>

See I gotta change the channel in rap take it back as a hole<end_line>
One of these rappers try to act as THE MOLE<end_line>
Just an AVERAGE JOE or just a JACKASS<end_line>
Probably a BACHELOR with QUEER EYE for straight ass<end_line>
I'm no APPRENTICE I landed a DREAM JOB<end_line>
In a scene where each mob on the streets with teams rob<end_line>
We don't live A SIMPLE LIFE we live by ROAD RULES<end_line>
TIL DEATH DO US PART and the tools are old school<end_line>
Fuck ELIMIDATE I should start elimi-fake emcee<end_line>
Who's career is just 1 big mistake cuz<end_line>
This is the REAL WORLD where you watch from cheap seats<end_line>
WEAKEST LINK's get killed over beats and defeats<end_line>
2 of the best died they don't find no murder weapon<end_line>
No suspects no TAXI CAB CONFESSION<end_line>
No search star killers the faces glazed over<end_line>
This entire case needs an EXTREME MAKEOVER<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I'm hot I don't stop when I'm taking a stand<end_line>
And keep my pockets Puffy like I'm MAKING THE BAND<end_line>
Won't be no TRADING SPACES or even A CHANGE OF HEART<end_line>
I don't use SCARE TACTICS I'll tear you apart<end_line>
This is reality to make it though BOOTCAMP<end_line>
WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE with a pocket of food stamps<end_line>
YOU GOTTA SEE THIS for THIRTY SECONDS OF FAME<end_line>
AMERICA'S MOST WANTED try and step in this game<end_line>
They water down the show with these hooks that just rival<end_line>
Ozzy OSBOURNE'S speech when he needs a sub-title<end_line>
I'm not in it for fame or even the props<end_line>
If I wasn't ripping mics you could find me on COPS<end_line>
Being chased by hands of fans for autographs<end_line>
And police who say I left them a trail of bloodbath<end_line>
For killing instrumentals from snares & kicks now<end_line>
To guitars & licks arrested and thrown in THE BIG HOUSE<end_line>
<verse_end>
