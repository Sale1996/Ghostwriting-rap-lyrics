So this is it, this is what I wished for<end_line>
Just isn't how I envisioned it, fame to the point of imprisonment<end_line>
I just thought the shit'd be different<end_line>
But somethin changed the minute that I got a whiff of it<end_line>
I started to inhale it, smell it, started sniffin it<end_line>
And it became my cocaine, I just couldn't quit<end_line>
I just wanted a little bit<end_line>
Then it turned me to a monster, I became a hypocrite<end_line>
Concert after concert, I was rakin in the dough, rollin in green<end_line>
Had the game hemmed up, like a sewing machine<end_line>
But I was losin my freedom, there was nowhere for me<end_line>
to not go and be seen, and just go and be me<end_line>
And there was no in-between<end_line>
You either loved it or hate it, every CD critics gave it a 3<end_line>
then three, years later they go back and re-rate it<end_line>
Then called "The Slim Shady LP" the greatest<end_line>
"The Marshall Mathers" was a classic, "The Eminem Show" was fantastic<end_line>
But "Encore" just didn't have the caliber to match it<end_line>
I guess enough time just ain't passed yet<end_line>
A couple more years that shit'll be "Illmatic"<end_line>
And eight years later I'm still at it<end_line>
Divorced, re-married, a felon, a father, sleepin pill addict<end_line>
And this is real talk, I feel like The Incredible Hulk<end_line>
My back has been broke and I can still walk<end_line>

<verse_start>
I got a letter from a fan that said, he's been prayin for me<end_line>
Every day and for some reason it's been weighin on my mind heavy<end_line>
Cause I don't read every, letter I get<end_line>
But somethin told me to go ahead and open it<end_line>
But, why would someone pray for you when they don't know you?<end_line>
You didn't pray for me when I was local<end_line>
And as I lay these vocals, I think of all the shit I had to go through<end_line>
Just to get to where I'm at, I've already told you<end_line>
at least, a thousand times in these rhymes<end_line>
I appreciate the prayer but I've already got, God on my side<end_line>
And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it?<end_line>
Just watchin it from a opposite standpoint, man boy's got to look<end_line>
nuts, and that's the only word I can think of<end_line>
right now on how, to describe the shit<end_line>
This is like a vibe you get, go ahead and bop to it<end_line>
Just watch what you wish for cause I got the shit<end_line>
