Flyin down I-75 'bout to hop on 696<end_line>
I look over this fuckin chick's tryin to fix <end_line>
her make-up, I'm like bitch - you ain't a plastic surgeon<end_line>
I advise ya to put up your visor, I'm gettin kinda ticked<end_line>
You're blockin my side mirror, she's like "Yeah, so?"<end_line>
I'm like, sew? You gon' need a stitch you keep actin like that, hoe<end_line>
I look like your husband, slut?<end_line>
That's a rhetorical question, you talk to me like you talk to him I'll fuck you up!<end_line>
In fact, get in the back seat<end_line>
like the rest of my dates, no bitch rides shotgun, what? Taxi<end_line>
Stop and pick you some Maxi pads up, is that what you actually asked me?<end_line>
Bitch reaches over and smacks me<end_line>
Says I annoy the FUCK out her, get the fuckin back, put on your slut powder<end_line>
You slut, what? And shut the fuck up now or<end_line>
get your feelings hurt worse than my last chick when I accidentally butt-dialed her <end_line>
and she heard me spreadin AIDS rumors about her<end_line>
Turn the radio up louder, make it thump<end_line>
while I bump that "Relapse" CD tryin to hit every bump<end_line>
And that cunt thought I snapped back into ac-cents<end_line>
Cause she kept askin me to quit callin her cunt, I said "I CUN'T!"<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
We've been ridin around in this hatchback 'til I'm fuckin hunchback<end_line>
Where the fuck's this party at slut bag cunt? Cut what act?<end_line>
Think it's an act? Fuck that, I'm tryin to shag scuzz, better find this love shack<end_line>
or somewhere to fuck at; ah, don't touch that<end_line>
You fat dyke, I'm tryin to hear some +Bagpipes <end_line>
From Baghdad+, don't act like you don't like 'em, them accents I rap tight<end_line>
And I'ma torture you 'til we find this place, yeah that's right<end_line>
Thought it was just past this light, just past Van Dyke<end_line>
Better hit that map light - read them directions, oh yeah<end_line>
You can't read, and you can't write, told me that last night<end_line>
She took my CD out the deck, snapped it in half like<end_line>
"Relapse" sucked, I snapped, hit the gas like<end_line>
Blew through the light, spun out, hit a patch of black ice<end_line>
Forgot we had a trailer hitched to the back, we jackknifed<end_line>
Bitch flew out the car, I laughed like she deserved it<end_line>
She didn't think I'd act like that in person<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Tell him I'll be there in a minute<end_line>
I'm tryin to break up this catfight between my mistress and damn wife<end_line>
Then a chick wanted a hug, she was fat<end_line>
So I gave her dap, then I tell her to scat<end_line>
I'm not mean, I'm cute; on my way to the front door takin the scenic route<end_line>
to avoid this chick with a lace front lookin like Venus's and Serena's hooves<end_line>
I'm just sayin, them chicks got horse asses, they been attractive<end_line>
Hope when they see me they don't slap me with they tennis rackets<end_line>
My mind drifted, back to this shit<end_line>
I see my wife push her down, step over her body, then smack the mistress<end_line>
Police outside, I turn and pass the gat to Vishis<end_line>
then I step out and see my Evil twin; he gives me an evil grin<end_line>
He mugs the mistress, turns around and gives the misses hugs and kisses<end_line>
Looks at me twisted, like Nickel<end_line>
He smacks the dentures outta the mouth of the fat bitch he rolled with<end_line>
and looks back to mention<end_line>
They said<end_line>
<verse_end>
