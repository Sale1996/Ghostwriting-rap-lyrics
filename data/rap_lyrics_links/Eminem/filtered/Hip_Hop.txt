Man, I thought this was supposed to be hip hop, hip hop<end_line>
I'd rather be fishin' in flip flops, flip flops<end_line>
Or cross over to country like Kid Rock, did, I<end_line>
Can't see no country singers beefin' over some guitar<end_line>
Riff that Willie Nelson lifted from Bob Seger <end_line>
When I was younger I was so eager<end_line>
To have a gun I would do the same<end_line>
Couldn't wait to get to the shootin' range<end_line>
Me and my man Goofy Gary just tryin' to let loose some steam<end_line>
Muthafuckas laughin' 'cause I couldn't aim<end_line>
So I'd pull the fuckin' target closer and just shoot the thang<end_line>
I used to have this theory: keep three bullets in the gun<end_line>
It was a mandatory year up here in Michigan<end_line>
For each bullet if you got no CCW license<end_line>
I tried to apply for one, they said it'd take 5-6 months<end_line>
What the fuck am I supposed to do mean time when rivals come?<end_line>
Hide that sumbitch in the glovebox or inside the trunk<end_line>
Now, back to what my three-bullet theory was<end_line>
I'm triple platinum, I ain't tryin' to catch no murder one<end_line>
Figured I'd shoot to wound, probably miss with at least one<end_line>
But them other two gon' fuck his shoulder and his kneecap up<end_line>
Then I'ma say it's self defense, how come I had the gun<end_line>
Was because I was at the range, on my way back from<end_line>
This dude approached me on some bullshit<end_line>
I'd get a year for each bullet at the most<end_line>
As opposed to havin' a full clip in that<end_line>
That was my idiotic logic, it was basically for safety<end_line>
But it gave me power, and it made me crazy<end_line>
And psychotic, I just got retarded once I got it<end_line>
Thank God it was empty the night that I got caught with it<end_line>
What the fuck, man I thought that it was supposed to be...<end_line>
