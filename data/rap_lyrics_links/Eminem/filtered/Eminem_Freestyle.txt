<verse_start>
If I'm elected for ten terms<end_line>
I'm renewing the staff after the inagural<end_line>
And hiring all girls as interns<end_line>
If I don't like you, I'll snatch you outta your mic booth<end_line>
While you're rappin and pull your right through the window and fight you<end_line>
I'll take you straight to the pavement<end_line>
Uppercut you, and scrape your face wit a bracelet<end_line>
Like a razor that shaved it<end_line>
Three drinks and I'm ready to flash<end_line>
Runnin on stage in a G-string, wit a bee sting on my ass<end_line>
It's probably all cuz I ain't awkward at all<end_line>
I just like to walk through the mall, stop, and talk to the wall<end_line>
And have a relapse after I just fought through withdrawl<end_line>
The Bad and Evil movement is comin<end_line>
Plus the music is pumpin like a pill freak wit a tube in his stomach<end_line>
I write a rhyme a day<end_line>
So it's no wonder how come your whole album <end_line>
Is soundin like a bunch of shit that I would say<end_line>
Whether it's one verse or one letter<end_line>
I'll probably be the cleverest one that never gets spun ever<end_line>
It's Slim Shady and Tony Touch, it's only us<end_line>
The rest of y'all are just stuck in the middle wit Monie Love<end_line>
<verse_end>
