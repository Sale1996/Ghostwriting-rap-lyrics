Man these are average raps, I'm keepin the savage batch hidden<end_line>
The can of whoop ass with the Shady/Aftermath clique<end_line>
You pop off the top, it's like openin vats of acid<end_line>
Beat the Octomom to death with Cabbage Patch Kid<end_line>
Attack a snatch yeah there's somethin to jack a batch in<end_line>
Impregnated then chewed up the embryo sack with Mac-10s'<end_line>
Triplets, quadruplets, and a couple of back-to-back twins<end_line>
That fetus is fallin out all over, Jack is back again<end_line>
The Ripper's at your service, girl I can see that you're nervous<end_line>
But I barely scratch the surface, llke my last batch of girlfriends<end_line>
That I buried in my fuckin backyard, still tryin to dig their way out<end_line>
I foam like an attack dog, how late you wanna stay out?<end_line>
It's past your curfew when it's dark, I'm searchin for you in the park<end_line>
Shady murdered him another virgin, he just hit his mark<end_line>
He met his quota for the month, they found Dakota all rolled up<end_line>
Inside a bag, he probably dragged the body for about a block<end_line>
Disappeared without a trace, no DNA, no not a drop<end_line>
'Cause me and Dre and 50 we will never get caught by the cops<end_line>
CSI, they hate us but they gotta give a lot of props<end_line>
The drama pops, grab the butcher knife from off the counter tops<end_line>

Yeah, I'm as ill as can be<end_line>
My appeal is to serial killers what a pill is to me<end_line>
Killin' so villainously<end_line>
Still as maniacal on the night goin psycho as Michael Myers <end_line>
You know what we're like on the muthafuckin mic, so try us <end_line>
and you're gonna find out what the fuck we're like with pliers<end_line>

Chris Reeves in his grave, yeah homie, turn turn<end_line>
I'm debatin, mutilatin the lady<end_line>
You've been waitin for Shady and Fif, ain't no duplicatin it, baby<end_line>
There's a baby in the dryer, there's a torso in the washer<end_line>
I think it might even belong to Portia when I tossed her<end_line>
Arms and legs in the garbage, 'cause the rest of her, I lost her<end_line>
Her head is in the disposal with Jessica's I squashed her<end_line>
I put her on the ringer and hung her over the wash tub<end_line>
