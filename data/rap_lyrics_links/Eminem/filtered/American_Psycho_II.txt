<verse_start>
I probably got a screw loose or two, or maybe three or four of 'em<end_line>
Some fell out and hit the floor<end_line>
All I know is ever since my fuckin' head hit the snowbank<end_line>
I been a little Neanderthalish, no thanks to my man D'Angelo Bailey<end_line>
But I just take it slow daily, my biggest dilemma's<end_line>
Tryin' to figure whether to use the flat head or the Phillips<end_line>
Or just go to the Home Depot and pick the new power drill up<end_line>
Gives me two hours and six days and I'm still up<end_line>
I feel like I'm about to snap any minute<end_line>
There's a new Tower Records about to stop and get a fill-up<end_line>
Pick the new Cypress Hill up<end_line>
And go find who did that shit to Xzibit<end_line>
And go fill up a whole liquor bottle with piss<end_line>
And shatter his fuckin lips wit' it<end_line>
<verse_end>
