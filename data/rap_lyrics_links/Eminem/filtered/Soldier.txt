Yo.. never was a thug, just infatuated with guns<end_line>
Never was a gangsta, 'til I graduated to one<end_line>
and got the rep of a villain, for weapon concealin<end_line>
Took the image of a thug, kept shit appealin<end_line>
Willin to stick out my neck, for respect if it meant<end_line>
life or death, never live to regret what I said<end_line>
When you're me, people just want to see, if it's true<end_line>
If it's you, what you say in your raps, what you do<end_line>
So they feel, it's part of your obligation to fulfill<end_line>
When they see you on the streets, face to face, are you for real?<end_line>
In confrontation ain't no conversation, if you feel<end_line>
you're in violation, any hesitation'll get you killed<end_line>
If you feel it, kill it, if you conceal it, reveal it<end_line>
Being reasonable will leave you full of bullets<end_line>
Pull it, squeeze it 'til it's empty, tempt me, push me, pussies<end_line>
I need a good reason to give this trigger a good squeeze<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I love pissin you off, it gets me off<end_line>
Like my lawyers, when the fuckin judge lets me off<end_line>
All you motherfuckers gotta do is set me off<end_line>
I'll violate and all the motherfuckin bets be off<end_line>
I'm a lit fuse, anything I do bitch it's news<end_line>
Pistol whippin motherfuckin bouncers, six-two<end_line>
Who needs bullets? As soon as I pull it, you SWEAT bullets<end_line>
An EXCELLENT method to get rid of the next bully<end_line>
ACTUALLY better cause instead of you murderin<end_line>
you can hurt 'em and come BACK again and kick dirt at 'em<end_line>
It's like pourin salt in the wounds, assault and get sued<end_line>
You can smell the lawsuits soon as I waltz in the room<end_line>
Everybody halts and stops, calls the cops<end_line>
All you see is bitches comin out their haltertops<end_line>
Runnin and duckin out the Hot Rocks parking lot<end_line>
You'll all get shot, whether it's your fault or not, cause<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I spit it slow so these kids know that I'm talkin to 'em<end_line>
Give it back to these damn critics and sock it to 'em<end_line>
I'm like a thug, with a little bit of 'Pac influence<end_line>
I spew it, and look how I got you bitches rockin to it<end_line>
You motherfuckers could NEVER do it like I could do it<end_line>
Don't even try it, you'll look stupid, do not pursue it<end_line>
Don't ever in your life try to knock the truest<end_line>
I spit the illest shit ever been dropped to two inch<end_line>
So ticky-tock listen as the sound ticks on the clock<end_line>
Listen to the sound of Kim as she licks on a cock<end_line>
Listen to the sound of me spillin my heart through this pen<end_line>
Motherfuckers know that I'll never be Marshall again<end_line>
Full of controversy until I retire my jersey<end_line>
'Til the fire inside dies and expires at thirty<end_line>
And Lord have mercy on any more of these rappers that verse me<end_line>
And put a curse on authorities in the face of adversity<end_line>
<verse_end>
