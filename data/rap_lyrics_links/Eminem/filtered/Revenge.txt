Well in the beginning we<end_line>
felt like we was meant to be, I fell for you and skinned my knee<end_line>
But hell with any injury, eventually you'll get up gingerly<end_line>
Feels like it'll take a century to heal<end_line>
But just know that I will<end_line>
But fuck tryna make amends, I'd rather take revenge<end_line>
You're stickin safety pins inside my atrium, your day begins at 8 PM<end_line>
You'll hit the ATM in my Mercedes Benz<end_line>
with all your lady, friends  whores<end_line>
Hit the club and you go out, don't know a sum cause when I cal-<end_line>
-culate the times you cheated and I total up all the amounts<end_line>
It doesn't add up, cause you say that just givin out<end_line>
your number doesn't count  get it?<end_line>
Then see me with someone new, get mad and flip it, look how bad you spin it<end_line>
First you turn your back on me then tell me that I stabbed you in it?<end_line>
Stabbed you in it, stabbed you in it<end_line>
Stabbed you in it, stabbed you in it<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
So when you're driving, driving to his house<end_line>
And you pass me, while I'm drivin to hers<end_line>
Just remember, you cheated on me first<end_line>
You're a whore, you're a whore, this is war<end_line>
