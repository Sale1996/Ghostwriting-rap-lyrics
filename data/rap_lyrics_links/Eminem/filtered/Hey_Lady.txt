Hey lady,<end_line>
I don't think you really wanna be my girl<end_line>
Fuckin' with me can be dangerous<end_line>
You never what I might really be like<end_line>
In your life, I'm the type<end_line>
That might flip and get a little bit crazy<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I'm internationally known baby but actually<end_line>
There are few people who know how I am naturally<end_line>
All you know is that I can act irrationally<end_line>
When you shove a puppet up in my face on national TV<end_line>
So they label me this crazed loony rap bully<end_line>
But truthfully that ain't the truth<end_line>
And if you believe in that shit<end_line>
Then you'll believe anything's true<end_line>
And you're too stupid to ever get to know me personally<end_line>
But personally that actually works for me<end_line>
Cuz the last thing that I need's a string attached to me<end_line>
I'ma bachelor bitch and I ain't in no fast fury<end_line>
To run out and find a new Mrs. Mathers<end_line>
Cuz see, technically me and Kim ain't back fully<end_line>
But we do still make booty calls occasionally<end_line>
But be damned if I end up back in that pattern<end_line>
And we end up back at that god damn tavern<end_line>
And havin' another déjà vu, we seein' security<end_line>
Pass my pussy around like it's Ja Rule's jewelry<end_line>
I got news for you bitch, your news curfew's early<end_line>
You ain't home by 2:30you heard me?<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Hey lady, hey lady<end_line>
I don't think you really wanna be my girl<end_line>
Fuckin' with me can be dangerous<end_line>
You never know what I really<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
What we do under the covers should stay between the covers<end_line>
And the two of us and we ain't gotta be news coverage<end_line>
On the front page cover of "Us" as new lovers<end_line>
And this is when the bitch get to showin' the true colors<end_line>
Cuz the truth of it, everything that I do's public<end_line>
And you'd love it if you could run and tell all your friends<end_line>
Guess who you just screwed as soon as me and you've done it<end_line>
And save the used rubber to show 'em the proof of it<end_line>
But I guess it's do unto others as you'd have 'em do unto you<end_line>
But you better be careful of who you're doin' it to<end_line>
Cuz you never know when the shoe<end_line>
Could end up on the other foot and it backfires on you<end_line>
Cuz you think you want it then you want me, then you get me<end_line>
Then you got me and you're fucked cuz you'll be stuck with me<end_line>
For the rest of your life cuz if I get attached to you<end_line>
We'll be joined at the hip, I'll be so latched to you<end_line>
You'll be walkin' out the house and I'll run up and tackle you<end_line>
Chain your ass up to the bed and shackle you<end_line>
You don't think you're leavin' this house in that, do you?<end_line>
Not till I brand my name in your ass and tattoo you<end_line>
And have you walkin' out this bitch in turtleneck sweaters<end_line>
Scarves and full leathers in 90 degree weather<end_line>
Front on me? Never<end_line>
Cuz we gonna be together forever<end_line>
Right bitch?<end_line>
Right bitch?<end_line>
