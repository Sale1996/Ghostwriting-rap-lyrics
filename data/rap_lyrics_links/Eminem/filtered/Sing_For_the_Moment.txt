<verse_start>
These ideas are, nightmares to white parents<end_line>
whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings<end_line>
Like whatever they say has no bearing<end_line>
It's so scary in a house that allows, no swearing<end_line>
to see him walkin around with his headphones blaring<end_line>
Alone in his own zone, cold and he don't care<end_line>
He's a problem child, and what bothers him all comes out<end_line>
when he talks about, his fuckin dad walkin out<end_line>
Cause he just hates him so bad that he, blocks him out<end_line>
If he ever saw him again he'd probably knock him out<end_line>
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin back<end_line>
Talkin black, brainwashed from rock and rap<end_line>
He sags his pants; doo rags and a stockin cap<end_line>
His step-father hit him so he, socked him back<end_line>
and broke his nose, his house is a broken home<end_line>
There's no control, he just let's his emotions go<end_line>

<verse_start>
Entertainment is changin, intertwinin with gangsters<end_line>
In the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum<end_line>
Holy or unnholy, only have one homie<end_line>
Only this gun - lonely cause don't anyone know me<end_line>
Yet everybody just feels like they can relate<end_line>
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great<end_line>
or they can degrate; or even worse, they can teach hate<end_line>
It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make<end_line>
like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum<end_line>
Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen?<end_line>
From standin on corners and porches just rappin<end_line>
to havin a fortune, no more kissin ass<end_line>
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you<end_line>
Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you<end_line>
to get they hands on every dime you have<end_line>
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad<end_line>
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon<end_line>
Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns<end_line>
That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me<end_line>
Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly<end_line>
But all they kids be listenin to me religiously<end_line>
So I'm signin CD's while police fingerprint me<end_line>
They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me<end_line>
If I'm such a fuckin menace this shit doesn't make sense B!<end_line>
It's all political, if my music is literal<end_line>
and I'm a criminal how the FUCK can I raise a little girl?<end_line>
I couldn't; I wouldn't be fit to<end_line>
You're full of shit too Guerrera - that was a FIST that hit you!<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
They say music can alter moods and talk to you<end_line>
Well can it load a gun up for you and cock it too?<end_line>
Well if it can, and the next time you assault a dude<end_line>
Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued<end_line>
See what these kids do is hear about us totin pistols<end_line>
and they want to get one cause, they think the shit's cool<end_line>
Not knowin we really just protectin ourselves<end_line>
We entertainers, of course the shit's affectin our sales<end_line>
You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self<end_line>
We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail<end_line>
It's fucked up ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin<end_line>
to bein able to have any fuckin thing that we wanted<end_line>
That's why we, sing for these kids who don't have a thing<end_line>
except for a dream and a fuckin rap magazine<end_line>
Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long<end_line>
Idolize they favorite rappers and know all they songs<end_line>
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives<end_line>
'Til they sit and they cry at night wishin they'd die<end_line>
'Til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe<end_line>
We're nothin to you - but we're the fuckin shit in they eyes<end_line>
That's why we, seize the moment try to freeze it and own it<end_line>
Squeeze it and hold it, cause we consider these minutes golden<end_line>
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone, just let our spirits live on<end_line>
through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can...<end_line>
