I'm packin up my shit, as much shit in the car as I can fit<end_line>
And I'm just drivin as far as I can get<end_line>
Away from these problems 'til all of my sorrows I forget<end_line>
What's tomorrow like? Cause tonight, I'm startin life again<end_line>
Get to the corner and stop, fuck am I goin?<end_line>
Besides psycho when I fantasize startin my whole life over<end_line>
Yeah right, oh and I might go and<end_line>
get hypnotized so I don't even recognize no one<end_line>
I try to look alive but there's nothin like holdin<end_line>
your head up high when you're dead inside and I just hide, so in<end_line>
case you're wonderin why are my insides showin<end_line>
Cause I done spilled all my guts, and those are mine so I'm<end_line>
pickin 'em up and stuffin 'em back<end_line>
Fuck it, I've done enough in this rap shit, +Recovery+ brought me nothin but back<end_line>
to right where I was and perhaps<end_line>
This coulda been my victory lap, if I wasn't on the verge of +Relapse+<end_line>

It seems, to be the reoccurring main thing, the shit I<end_line>
would daydream as a kid I, was 18, I went<end_line>
from an irate teenager to, still raging as an adult<end_line>
Amazing, back then I put anything into the<end_line>
rhyme, whether it was sad, mad, happy or angry I spit it<end_line>
The mainstream, I hit it, yay me, I did it<end_line>
Did what? Hailie, baby, I didn't<end_line>
mean to make you 80 percent of<end_line>
what I rapped about, maybe I shoulda<end_line>
did a better job at separating Shady and enter-<end_line>
-taining from real life, but this dang thing is still the<end_line>
hardest thing to explain, it's the craziest shit I<end_line>
ever seen and back then it was like I ain't even<end_line>
bothered taking into consideration<end_line>
you one day being older and may hear me say things, I did it<end_line>
Aim me, and be, just ain't me<end_line>
Okay, so ladies and gentle-<end_line>
-men let's strip away, everything and see the main reason that I<end_line>
feel like a lame piece of shit I sound cranky, and bitter<end_line>
Complain, beef and bicker 'bout the same things cause when I<end_line>
look at me, I don't see what they see, I feel a-<end_line>
-shamed, greedy and lately I've been contemplating escaping to get a-<end_line>
-way and go wherever this road takes me<end_line>
It's making me crazy what's in my<end_line>
<verse_end>
