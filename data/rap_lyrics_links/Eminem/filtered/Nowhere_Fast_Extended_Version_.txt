Sandy Hook, Stoneman Douglas, another lone-wolf gunman<end_line>
Sometimes I don't know what this world has come to, it's blowin up and<end_line>
this whole country is goin nuts and the, NRA is, in our way<end_line>
They're responsible for this whole production, they hold the strings to control the puppets<end_line>
... And they threaten to take away donor bucks<end_line>
So they know the government won't do nothin and no one's budgin, gun owners' clutchin<end_line>
their loaded weapons, they love their guns more than our children<end_line>
Shh, think another one just entered in our building<end_line>
And we'll be<end_line>

I feel sorry for this beat, sympathy pains for this track<end_line>
This road is takin me back, down memory lane with this rap<end_line>
I can still look out in this crowd, be wowed and be taken aback<end_line>
I'm simply stating a fact, I had Wembley Stadium packed<end_line>
But now we're on a path headed to nowhere and, fast<end_line>
Another terrorist, attacks, like a tariff, blows half<end_line>
of Madison Square up, alas, we perish, in the blast<end_line>
But that isn't scarin us, we pass knowin we're fearless<end_line>
Cause we're just<end_line>

Fuck doin what you're told, act like a 2-year old<end_line>
Shit is soon to go kaboom and blow anyways, for MC's it's a funeral<end_line>
When I'm devisin this rhyme, cause I'm a-wake and you're mourning/morning<end_line>
That's why I rise and I shine, like a new day has dawned on me<end_line>
Gusto, guts, bravado<end_line>
Nuts and plus I kick up dust and cuss a lot, I musta got you in somewhat of a debacle<end_line>
Cause some stuff that's awful, really don't mean nothin although<end_line>
There's a lot of, shit I said in-jest, that's tough to swallow<end_line>
... But if at times my heart it seems<end_line>
like it's in the wrong place, it's probably cause, it's on my sleeve<end_line>
Keanu Reeves, +Speed+ of life, avoid or veer or just steer<end_line>
toward it, we're only lookin forward, but where we're goin, we have no idea<end_line>
Nowhere to go but hysterical, it's gettin warm in here<end_line>
I set the world on fire, was born to be an arsonist<end_line>
Just one spark and it's lit, but I'ma still get dark on this shit<end_line>
Told you I'd leave my mark on this bitch - War Machine<end_line>
But you forced me in a corner, I'm sure to, have somethin for your rear<end_line>
And in the course of the assault as torture, gets more severe<end_line>
Go to war with me you'll end up blew to Timbuktu, I'll send at you<end_line>
a 10-ton nuke like Kim Jong-Un and end up ruinin your Korea/career!<end_line>
But when all is said and done<end_line>
And at the end of my run I'll just rewind clocks, forever young<end_line>
Make time stop, will I ever fall off? That day'll never come<end_line>
To the pine box bitch, fuck you! I'm better than I ever was<end_line>
'Til the bomb drops, hope it never does but, I'm not gonna sweat it cause<end_line>
This world's screwed, it's already fucked, and I'm on top, so everyone's just<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
You can't, tell us nothin<end_line>
Hard-headed, and we're stubborn<end_line>
So, one ear, and out the other<end_line>
When we're young, we're young, we're young<end_line>
Who knows what the future for us could hold?<end_line>
Another shooter, uh-oh<end_line>
No more tomorrows, we're done, we're done<end_line>
And all we are is<end_line>
<verse_end>
