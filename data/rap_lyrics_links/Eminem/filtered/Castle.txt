I just want you to know that I ain't scared<end_line>
Whatever it takes to raise you, I'm prepared<end_line>
to do whatever<end_line>
To do whatever<end_line>

You'll be comin out of mommy's stomach soon<end_line>
I better do somethin quick if I'ma be able to support you<end_line>
I can barely support me, but as long as you're healthy<end_line>
That's all that matters for the time being, but obviously<end_line>
Assuming you will be, just thinking ahead, I'ma make it if it kills me<end_line>
Let's see how far I can take it with this music<end_line>
I'm gettin sick of chasing this illusion<end_line>
Sorry for sloppy writin, the pen in my hand is shakin, please excuse me<end_line>
Dad's a little nervous, but at the same time excited<end_line>
If I use this same energy while I'm sayin rhymes and write 'em<end_line>
with the same passion and the same exact enthusiasm<end_line>
as I'm using in this letter maybe they can feel me as I'm<end_line>
trying to build these castles out of sand, baby girl<end_line>
For you to sit on the throne, I got plans, baby girl<end_line>
Welcome to Mom and Dad's crazy world<end_line>
Love, Daddy; maple-flavored kisses, buttered pancakes and syrup<end_line>

You got your Momma's personality, same eyes as I got<end_line>
Her beautiful smile, but your ears are the same size as mine are<end_line>
Sorry for that, lil' minor mishap<end_line>
But you'll grow into 'em baby, I'm on the grind now<end_line>
I'm doin little shows, open mics, all-nighters<end_line>
at studios, while I'm tryna keep the lights on<end_line>
Why does it seem like I'm so close to this dream, yet so far?<end_line>
I just keep steerin, I'ma turn into someone<end_line>
I haven't the slightest, clue what I'ma do if it falls through<end_line>
You took your first steps today, you'll probably walk soon<end_line>
My "Infinite" CD flopped, too many soft tunes<end_line>
They're talkin bad about Dad, it's tickin me off too<end_line>
Makes me feel like I don't belong or somethin, ooh<end_line>
I think I might've just stumbled onto somethin, new<end_line>
Got a prediction for the future, I'm hopin that you'll<end_line>
open this envelope when you're older and it holds true<end_line>

Now if you found these letters, I guess I better try to explain<end_line>
A lot's happened in between them, since I rised to this fame<end_line>
I've said your name but always tried to hide your face<end_line>
This game is crazy, I wanted to claim my love for you, but dang<end_line>
I never knew it'd be like this, if I did I wouldn't have done it<end_line>
You ain't asked for none of this shit, now you're bein punished?<end_line>
Things that should've been private with me and your mother is public<end_line>
I can't stomach, they can take this fame back, I don't want it!<end_line>
I'll put out this last album then I'm done with it<end_line>
100% finished, fed up with it, I'm hangin it up, FUCK IT!<end_line>
Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know<end_line>
that I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold<end_line>
And if things should worsen, don't take this letter I wrote<end_line>
as a goodbye note, cause your dad's at the end of his rope<end_line>
I'm slidin down a slippery slope, anyways sweetie, I better go<end_line>
I'm gettin sleepy; love, Dad - shit, I don't know<end_line>
