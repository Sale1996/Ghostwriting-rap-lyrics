<verse_start>
You used to say, that I'd, never be<end_line>
nothin without you, and I, believe<end_line>
I'm shot in the lungs, I gasp, I can't breathe<end_line>
Just lay here with me, baby hold, me please<end_line>
And I'd beg, and I'd plead, drop to knees<end_line>
And I'd cry, and I'd scream, "Baby please don't leave!"<end_line>
Snatch the keys, from your hand, I would squeeze<end_line>
and you'd laugh, and you'd tease, you're just fuckin with me<end_line>
And you must hate me; why do you date me<end_line>
if you say I make you siiiiick?<end_line>
And you've had enough of me<end_line>
I smother you, I'm 'bout to jump off the eeeeedge<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
A beautiful face, is all, that you have<end_line>
Cause on the inside you're, ug-ly and mad<end_line>
But you're all that I love, I grasp, you can't leave<end_line>
Please stay here with me, baby hold, me please<end_line>
And I'd beg, and I'd plead, drop to knees<end_line>
And I'd cry, and I'd scream, "Baby please don't leave!"<end_line>
But you left, and you took, everything<end_line>
I had left, and left nothin, nothin for me<end_line>
So please don't wake me, from this dream baby<end_line>
We're still together in my heeeeead<end_line>
And you're still in love with me<end_line>
'til I woke up to discover that that dream was deeeeead<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
You walked out... I almost died<end_line>
It was almost a homicide that you caused cause I was so traumatized<end_line>
Felt like I was in for a long bus ride, I'd rather die than you not by my side<end_line>
Can't count how many times I vomited, cried, go to my room, turn the radio on and hide<end_line>
Thought we were Bonnie and Clyde, nah, on the inside you were Jekyll and Hyde, I felt like my<end_line>
whole relationship with you was a lie, it was you and I, why did I think it was ride or die?<end_line>
Cause if you coulda, took my life you woulda, it's like you put a<end_line>
knife through my chest and pushed it right through to the, other side of my back and stuck a spike too, shoulda<end_line>
put up more of a fight but I couldn't at the time, no one could hurt me like you coulda<end_line>
Take you back now, what's the likelihood of that? Bite me bitch, chew on a nineteen-footer<end_line>
Cause this morning I finally stood up, held my chin up, finally showed a sign of life in me for the<end_line>
first time since you left and left me with nothin but shattered dreams and the life we coulda<end_line>
had and what coulda been, but I'm breakin out of this slump I'm in<end_line>
Pullin myself out of the dumps once again, I'm gettin up once and for all, fuck this shit!<end_line>
I'ma be late for the pity party, but you're never gonna beat me to the fuckin punch again<end_line>
Took it on the chin like a champ, so don't lump me in with them chump-ions<end_line>
I'm done being your punchin bag, it was November 31st today<end_line>
Would've been our anniversary, two years but you left on the first of May<end_line>
I wrote it on a calender, was gonna call but couldn't think of the words to say<end_line>
But they came to me just now, so I put 'em in a verse to lay<end_line>
<verse_end>
