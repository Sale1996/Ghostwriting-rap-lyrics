[Eminem]
Here we go, aga-in, from heroes
to villains, used to be your, Romeo, but we both
were jilted, a couple of times, so we had a slippery slope
to deal with, but still it, gave me hope
that we'll get, through it together, a severed earlobe
Mailed to you in an E-N-V-E-lope
Would be dope, but, what kind of lengths can you go?
Pull a Vincent van Gogh, just to convince a damn hoe
to be a housewife who outright lies
She's blackout drunk, now she's backin out my drive
I ran outside, why is she tryna act out? She's just about my size
Hit me in the mouth twice, guys
When someone you'd die for, sticks a steak knife in
your heart, do you try more? Another late night in
She stumbles through my door, lets the daylight in
And all we do's fight more, and I ain't violent
But she's goin through my drawers to plant the K-Y in
I'm gettin accused by a whore, who smells like St. Ides and
who's probably screwed five more guys, sucked eight-nine men
I'm takin two-by-fours, to our eight-by-tens
Bitch it's you I tore, out the frame, I win
Put up a new high score, beat this game I'm in
And here's some two-ply for, when you date my friends
In order to wipe your ass when you moved your bowels
When we renewed our vows, this the thanks I get?
I'm waitin for the day I can
hear you say, "Marshall, what a skank I've been
And there's a new guy you're, bein replaced by him"
Got your tubes tied for him, got that boob job for him
Hurts me to my core, but the pain I'm in
After you I swore, to make the gray skies end
Here come the rays like wind, you get a pay hike and
Am I the good guy or, do I just play like him?
And hope that he dumps you
It's like a dream come true, just to scream "Fuck you!"
Guess you take life in the same way you play dice then
Cause you just look at me and roll them little snake eyes in
Since

[Jessie Reyez]
Since you bought the jury, they'll call me guilty
They'll call me guilty
You bought the jury, they'll call me guilty
Even though you know the real me
You can't be the cheater, convince a non-believer
And I ain't in my feelings, I'm out
But I let you say that you're the good guy
I-yii, I-yii
Cause this ain't what love looks like
I-yii, I-yii, I-yii
You can't be the cheater, convince a non-believer
I ain't in my feelings, I'm out
But I let you say that you're the good guy
I-yii, I-yii-yii
They like, "You're the good guy"
They like, they like, they like, "You're the good guy"
