[Girl] I want you to take this
[N9ne] What is it
[Girl] Something that'll make ya feel real good
[N9ne] Aww damn girl, give it here

[Tech N9ne]
Often they blow your top
watch when they hold your jock
Shocked when they're not sold
Crouch and you lost composer
Soft for the hoes you're not stocked for the row
You walk for the hot shot wana cop and do lots of doser
She devil her greed level is hella high
Speed rebel exceed pedals with a devil's eye
They call girl and strip and all borough and trip
In y'all world and dip and all thorough and hip
Hustlers they sluts and drug smugglers
Money they double up throw that stuff up and bubble up
Best believe when I get you I'm bout to strap it down
Cuz when I'm tired I'm a tippied tired when ya cap it down
I gots to have it now
Tech N9ne its a habit got to stab it I'm a savage hound
She devils are incredible out for thy dough
When the ??? is grille, X and tapes of Tae-Bo, yo

[Chorus: Bizarre]
(Send me I warn you) She Devils in the house lemme here ya
(Heeyyy) Off top I gots to get near ya

[Bizarre]
Today my wife left, I don't give a fuck
Bitch thats why I'm paying you 150 bucks (how much for me and my man?)
to suck, me and Kuniva, let this diabetic dick touch your saliva
I think I'm gone and crazy, 14 to 48
Ever since we've fucked
I've been coughing and loosing weight
Skank ho, trying to creep
Bitch pick up your son
he been at school for a week (mommy!)
You fucking freak trying to get the best of me
Kidnap your ass
leave you lost like Kelly without Destiny
You skank trick, you suck dick
Jason Williams (what up)
Shoot this dirty bitch

[Chorus]

[Kuniva]
This devilist bitch is so succulent
Taking a piece of my soul every time
that I bust a nutt she's like a succubus
A nymphomanic laying me back on the filthy mattress
cum stains on it smelling like catfish
Still I hit it, yeah I did it
Her pussy travels
she doesn't have a pivot I remember when she was timid
Your scandalous ass taking a pass this cash
Got him on tape suckin your tit snortin and passing hash
I still had to grab that ass
Had to laugh at stories about your ragged ass maxi pads
You silly bitch, she used to be a nerdy bitch
Now she's in the backyard fucking 30 kids

[Kon Artis]
Now besides being on X, and regardless me loving sex
We getting close to you lex, its grindin every kick
Fingers up your pussy, your hands rubbing my dick
As soon as my wife push me
Your man's fucking her trick
You don't care if she know I trip
But she's starting to get ??? to it
Cuz She's finding matches in my pockets that say I strip
Which means I might get caught
loose everything that I've brought
The house the kids and the car
I know this sounds bizarre
but we should give her a call
and see if she want in
That way its 3 way sex and we can all be friends
I know you done if before
don't act like you haven't whore!
I'm about to loose my wife I can't afford a divorce!

[Chorus x2]

[Swift]
Fucking with your pussy is a handful (for real)
You think I'm drowning but I'm clowing
so basically bitch you a damn fool
And thats a given fact
plus I remember back when you was young
I could see 100 niggaz through your gap
And all of them was probably hitting that, thats embarrassing
You stuck with 30 children, 70 miscarrages
In and out of buildings, ain't carin' who it is
Fucking newly weds, didn't mean to do it but you did

[Proof]
Devil is she, she never to be (faithful)
Credit to free its better that she (tranquil)
Even her apple
my cock unlock the keys to your asshole
Stop the plot through the freeze with my cash flow
Cock the glock at them ??? in the castle
Fresh out of school with a disease in the tassel
Skis in the satchel
You just my (ho) thats the reason you stack dough

[Chorus x2]

[N9ne] Shit this feels good baby whatchu say this was again?
[Girl] Don't worry about it, just relax
[N9ne] oooooooo... here, let me lick on this
[Girl] Its gonna cost you
[N9ne] I got all of it baby
[Girl] Well that's exactly what I need

[Girl] All of it (*repeat "all of it" until fade*)
