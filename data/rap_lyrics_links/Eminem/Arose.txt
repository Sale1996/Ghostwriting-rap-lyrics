If I could rewind time like a tape
Inside a boombox, one day for every pill, or Percocet that I ate
Cut down on the Valium, I'da heard everything
But death is turnin so definite, wait!
They got me all hooked up to some machine
I love you being, didn't want you to know I was struggling!
Feels like I'm underwater submerged like a submarine
Just heard that nurse say, my liver and kidneys aren't functioning
Been flirtatious with death, skirt-chasin I guess, it's arrivederci
Same nurse just heard say they're unpluggin me
And it's your birthday, Jade I'm missin your birthday
Baby girl I'm sorry, I fuckin hate when you hurt, Hai'
And sweeties, thank you for waitin to open gifts
But girls, you can just open 'em, Dad ain't makin it home for Christmas
Wish I had the strength to just blow a kiss
I go to make a fist, but I can't make one, I'm frozen stiff
I yell but nothin comes out, I'm cryin inside, I shout
My vocal cords won't permit me, I scream but it's not aloud/allowed
You put your arm around Momma to calm her, wow
I just thought about the aisle I'll never get to walk you's down
Never see you, graduate in your caps and gowns
It's 'bout to be 2008, how's this happenin now?
I've got so much more to do
And Proof, I'm truly sorry if I let you down but this tore me in two
The thought of no more me and you
You gave me shoes, Nikes like new, for me for school
Doody I'm tryin, but you, you were the glue that binded
so many things; time, I'd give anything to rewind it
I had to walk down my halls and constantly be reminded
by pictures all on my walls and I couldn't sleep at night cause
that image burned in my brain of you on that table
Me fallin across your body, not able to stand to save you
God, why did you take him?
I'm tryna keep his legacy alive but I'm dyin, where's Nathan?
Little ladies be brave, take care of your mother
Smile pretty for pictures, always cherish each other
I'll always love ya, and I'll be in the back of your memory
And I know you'll never forget me, just don't get sad when remembering
And little bro, keep makin me proud
You better marry that girl cause she's faithfully down
And when you're exchangin those sacred vows, just know that if I could be there I would
And should you ever see parenthood, I know you'll be good at it
Oh, almost forgot to do somethin, thank my father too
I actually learned a lot from you, you taught me what not to do
And Mom, wish I'd have had the chance
to have one last heart-to-heart honest and open talk with you
Doody I see you, I go to walk to you
And I can feel my soul leave my body and float across the room
Nurses lean over the bed, pullin tubes out
Then the sheet over my head, shut the room down
Girls, please don't get upset, I see them cheeks soakin and wet
As you squeeze hold of my neck, so forcibly don't wanna let
me go, pillow drenched, emotional wrecks
With every second each closer to death
But suddenly I feel my heart begin to beat slow
Then a breath, machines go {*beep, beep, beep*}
Must've guessed the cheat codes to this shit
I'm tryna rewind time like a tape
Find an escape, make a beeline, try and awake
from this dream I, need to re-find, my inner strength
to remind, me even if a steep climb I must take
To rewrite a mistake, I'm rewindin the tape

{*tape rewinds back towards the end of "Castle"*}

[Eminem]
I don't want it!
I'll put out this last album then I'm done with it
100% finished, fed up with it, I'm hangin it up, FUCK IT!
Excuse the cursing, baby, but just know
that I'm a good person, though they portray me as cold
And if things should worsen, but I bet you they won't
I'm pledgin to throw this methadone in the toilet
Shred these old letters I wrote, on that old pathetic loathing
Closing credits can roll, I'm proud to, be back
I'm 'bout to/two, like a rematch, outdo "Relapse"
with "Recovery", "Mathers LP 2", help propel me to, victory laps
Gas toward 'em and fast forward the past
Consider them last four minutes as
the song I'da sang to my daughters
if I'da made it to the hospital less than two hours later, but I fought it
And, came back like a boomerang on 'em, now a new day is dawnin
I'm up, Tuesday, it's morning, now I know (haha)

{*pours out pills and toilet flushes*}
