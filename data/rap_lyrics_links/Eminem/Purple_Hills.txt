[Eminem]
Ugh.. yo yo yo, yo

[Chorus: Eminem]
I've been so many places, I've seen so many faces
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple hills
I've climbed the highest mountain, once or twice but who's countin
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple hills

[Eminem]
Yo, yo
Cool, calm, just like my mom
With a couple of lawsuits inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve 
To roll up on you like Christopher Reeves
I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by six people and five I hit (oops)
Aww [shit], I started a mosh pit
Squashed a chick and lost her foster kids (ahh!)
This room make me hallucinate
Then I sweat 'til I start losin weight
'Til I see dumb [shit] start happenin
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin to rap again
So bounce, bounce, come on bounce
{*GUNFIRE*} I said come on, bounce (ahh!)
Everybody in the house doin mass amounts (me!)
To the women in the thongs with they asses out (oh)
We don't bull[shit], better ask around
D-12 throws the bombest bash in town
Bizarre, your mom is crashin out
Help me get her on the couch 'fore she passes out
Come on!

[Kon Artis and Kuniva]
[Fuck] that, someone help Denaun
He's upstairs wrestlin Elton John
  Heh, hey Von you see me steppin on these leprechauns?
It gotta be Tums, the Exlaxe is gone
  Ya I took them all dawg with some parmesan
  And I think my arm is gone
Naw it's probably numb
Young, dumb, and full of [cum]
And I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue
  Scary ass it was a false alarm
  You think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on?
Yo stop actin stupid
You so high that you might wake up with a guy on some new [shit] (eww!)
Yeah I think I did too much (uh-huh)
I think I got the runs (uh-huh)
Rolaids, Pepto and Tums -- watch out, here it comes! {*laughter*}

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
Dirty Dozen, eighty of us, Shady brothers, ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers love us but they hate each other
They probably wanna take each other out and date each other
Some-, somethin, some'un, some'un, some'un {*babbling*}

[Proof]
Hop hills, hills I hop
Hop two hills on stilts I walk
Snort two lines that were filled with chalk
Thought it was +Incredible+ and killed the +Hulk+
I wanna, roll away like a rollerblade
Until my eyes fall back and I'm scared for days
And when I'm, over weight and my golf ball broke
No okey-doke, I'm packin my nose with soap
{*cough cough cough*} Am I supposed to choke?
Had an accident when the Trojan broke
Aww, poor baby, born by [whore] lady
Now I'm payin child support.. (it's your baby!)

[Swifty McVay]
I take fo' shots at one time
And I don't need a chaser when I'm swallowin' mine
(Hey, you got any room?) In Bizarre's hatchback?
We can't go far cause our car has flats
Why the hell you people think I rap?
Because my mother taught me how to breach contracts
And if you got cash, then hide it soon
(Swift, chill) I'm just tryin to get bi like you! (eww!)
And I don't give a damn if they find me rude (uh-huh)
Mean, crude, the hell with you too (uh-huh)
I only need three blunts and I'm cool
I just copped some and I'm goin back soon

[Chorus]

[Bizarre]
I'm at a rave lookin at a babe like she want it (hahaha)
Gin and tonic demonic, body smell like vomit
Loony, crazy, chunky, sexy, dopey-headed guy
Whip cream, dirty mattresses, wanna try? (c'mon)
Blue hills, golden seals, got Bizarre, actin ill
Drugs kill (yeah right) - chick, I'm for real!
Shut your mouth you dirty girl, you know you want me in your world
Ladies please don't fight; Bizarre's here all night!

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
Dirty Dozen, eighty of us, Shady brothers, ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers love us but they hate each other
They probably wanna take each other out and date each other
Some-, somethin, some'un, some'un, some'un {*babbling*}
