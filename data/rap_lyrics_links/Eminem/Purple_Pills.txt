[Eminem]
Ugh.. yo yo yo, yo

[Chorus: Eminem]
I take a couple uppers, I down a couple downers
But nothing compares to these blue and yellow purple pills
I've been to mushroom mountain, once or twice but who's countin
But nothin compares to these blue and yellow purple pills

[Eminem]
Yo, yo
Cool, calm, just like my mom
With a couple of valium inside her palm
It's Mr. Mischief with a trick up his sleeve
To roll up on you like Christopher Reeves
I can't describe the vibe I get
When I drive by six people and five I hit (oops)
Aww shit, I started a mosh pit
Squashed a bitch and stomped her foster kids (AHH!)
These 'shrooms make me hallucinate
Then I sweat till I start losin weight
'Til I see dumb shit start happenin
Dumber than Vanilla Ice tryin to rap again
So bounce, bounce, come on bounce
{*GUNFIRE*} I said come on, bounce
Everybody in the house with a half an ounce (me!)
Not weed, I meant coke, dumb-ass sit down
We don't bullshit, better ask around
D-12 throws the bombest bash in town
Bizarre, your mom is passin out
Get her ass on the couch 'fore she crashes out
Come on!

[Kon Artis and Kuniva]
Fuck that, someone help Denaun
He's upstairs naked with a weapon drawn
  Heh, hey Von you see me steppin on these leprechauns?
It gotta be acid cause the X is gone
  Ya I took them all dawg with some parmesan
  And I think my arm is gone
Naw it's probably numb
Young, dumb, and full of cum
And I think he 'bout to swallow his tongue
  Scary ass it was a false alarm
  You think I'm 'bout to die when I just got on?
Yo stop actin stupid
You so high that you might wake up with a guy on some new shit (EWW!)
Yeah I think I did too much -- This substance equals cups
Red pills, blue pills, and green -- Big pills (that's ill), mescaline!

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
Dirty Dozen, eighty of us, Shady brothers, ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers love us but they hate each other
They probably wanna take each other out and date each other
Some-, somethin, some'un, some'un, some'un {*babbling*}

[Proof]
Pop pills, pills I pop
Pop two pills on stilts I walk
Snort two lines that were filled with chalk
Thought it was +Incredible+ and killed the +Hulk+
I wanna, roll away like a rollerblade
Until my eyes roll back in my skull for days
And when I'm, old and gray look for dope to smoke
No okey-doke, I'm packin my nose with coke
{*cough cough cough*} Am I supposed to choke?
Had an accident when the Trojan broke
Ahh, poor baby, born by whore lady
Now I gotta strangle a.. (You're crazy!)

[Swifty McVay]
I pop fo' E's at one time
And I don't need water when I'm swallowin mine
(Yeah, you got any shrooms?) Does Bizarre smoke crack?
We can't get jobs cause our arms show tracks
Why the hell you niggaz think I rap?
We do it just to get your company hijacked
And if you like smack (uh-huh) then I might too
(Swift, chill) I just wanna get high like you! (ewww)
And I don't give a damn if they white or blue (uh-huh)
Speed, 'shrooms, down the valiums (uh-huh)
Even smoke weed outta vacuums
I just copped some and I'm goin back soon

[Chorus]

[Bizarre]
I'm at rave lookin like a slave, high off chronic
Gin and tonic demonic, body smell like vomit
Pussy poppin, acid droppin, dope-headed guy
Heroin mescaline, pencilnecks, wanna try?
Blue pills, golden seals, got Bizarre, actin ill
Drugs kill (Yeah right) - Bitch, I'm for real!!!
Shut your mouth you dirty slut, you know you want it in your butt
I'll put it in your cunt; let Bizarre nut!

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
Dirty Dozen, eighty of us, Shady brothers, ladies love us
That's why our baby mothers love us but they hate each other
They probably wanna take each other out and date each other
Some-, somethin, some'un, some'un, some'un {*babbling*}

{*harmonica plays until fade*}
