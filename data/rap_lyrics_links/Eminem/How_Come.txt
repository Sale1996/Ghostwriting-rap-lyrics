[Eminem - Talking]
So I changed huh, you got a phone
Pick up and call me

[Chorus - Eminem]
How Come.. we don't even talk no more
And you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine.. we ain't even beefin now
After all the years we've been down.. ain't no way no how
This bullshit cant be true
We family.. ain't a damn thing changed.. unless its you!

[Verse 1 - Eminem]
We were so young 
So full of life and vibrance 
Side by side, wherever you was riding, I went
So close, almost on some bonnie and clyde shit
When Ronnie died you was right by my side 
With a shoulder to cry on and tissue to wipe my eyes 
And a bucket to catch ever tear I cried inside it 
You even had the same type of childhood I did 
Sometimes I just wanna know why is it that you succaim to yours 
And mine I survived it. You ran the streets, I 9 to 5ed it 
We grew up, grew apart as time went by us 
And I blew up to both yours and mines surprises
Now I feel a vibe I just cant describe it
Much as your pride tries to hide it
Your cold your touch is just like ice 
And your eyes is a look of resentment
I can sense it and I don't like it

[Chorus - Eminem]
How Come.. we don't even talk no more
And you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine.. we ain't even beefin now
After all the years we've been down.. ain't no way no how
This bullshit cant be true
We family.. ain't a damn thing changed.. unless its you!

[Verse 2 - Kon Artis]
It was my dream at first to be off spitting a verse 
On my own album with a deal but shit got worse
Fore I came out I woulda killed a nigga first
For I let him disrespect me, or check me over some 
Worst some bitch that I wasn't with
I woulda hit it and quit
But you were p'aing to talk with her and tell her she was the shit
I told you don't get involved with her
You would smoke in the car with her
Coming outta the bar with her
Stumbling half drunk
Like y'all was husband and wife or somethin
But me catching her fuckin other niggas musta hurt your pride or something
Cause you were offin' your mouth to people like you wanted with me
When all I tried to do was show that your bitch was shifty
And every sister, fares and all the shit that I produced
You acting like I aint your man and lying like she cant be loose
But I am really your friend, I'm just trying to tell ya the truth
Dont hate the game or the player
The one thats changing is you

[Chorus - Eminem]
How Come.. we don't even talk no more
And you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine.. we ain't even beefin now
After all the years we've been down.. ain't no way no how
This bullshit cant be true
We family.. ain't a damn thing changed.. unless its you!

[Verse 3 - Proof]
Its gets lonely at the top cause my homie had to stop
Now we acting like I gotta live only for the block
And homies in the hood only see me on the tube
So they gossip on the porch
Get ta speaking all rude fools I used to rap wit all expect magic
Like my finger get to snappin
And poof it just happen 
But proof is just acting out the part he was thrown 
Shady made it so my babies aint starving at home 
See the devil in your glance
Since the ghetto we been friends, forever real intellegence 
Thats forever till the end 
I peep the hatred in your eyes, and the satan in your lies 
Aint wasting my time with these snakes in disguise
(HOW COME) When you talk it's with bitter and spite?
(AND HOW COME) It's my fault for what you did with your life? 
And everytime I go to hear you play, you look away 
We barely embrace, you cant even look me in my face

[Chorus - Eminem]
How Come.. we don't even talk no more
And you don't even call no more
We don't barely keep in touch at all
And I don't even feel the same love when we hug no more
And I heard it through the grapevine.. we ain't even beefin now
After all the years we've been down.. ain't no way no how
This bullshit cant be true
We family.. ain't a damn thing changed.. unless its you!
