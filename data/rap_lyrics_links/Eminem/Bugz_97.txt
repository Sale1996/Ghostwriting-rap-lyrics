[Bugz]
Fuck that! Who run shit once these drums hit?
You dove headfirst into some ol' dumb shit
Here's a can of asswhip, for you to come get
Yo' click made they trip, I make them hoes suck mint
Ask them girl, they know the scoop, don't fuck with Bugz bitch
I chop off her titty, have you suckin one tit
Them pink belly niggaz, is who you run wit
Makin half-ass songs, shitty snares and one kick
I hate yo' damn sound, don't like it one bit!
You could make a double album, won't have one hit!
Your entire outfit, is on some bullshit
And there's not a damn one that I can't outwit
I ad-mit, that my style is unfit
for momma's baby boy, because I'm on some dumb shit
Like I commit, larceny, give harm quick
You pull the alarm switch I stab you in your armpit
Now who the nitwit wanna come get wit
this egotistic hip-hop fundamentalistic
Don't risk it, you get your shit split
Now keep your distance, and keep existance
I'm persistant when it comes to bend shit
Smoke the, blunt with my judge right before my sentence
I'm relentless, to deny is senseless
Yo' bitch pay my bill, that's where the hell yo' rent went
Fuck that! {*gunshot*}
