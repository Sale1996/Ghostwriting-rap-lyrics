[Intro: Eminem]
Motherfuckers talkin crazy (yeah) sayin I should quit (yeah)
I fuckin tell 'em make me (bitch) eat a fuckin dick (yeah)
I'm feelin like the greatest (woo) one to be whoever did it
Mike Will the one who +Made It+, it's Shady on the lyrics

[Eminem]
I'm somewhat outlandish they say
You say we're cut from the same cloth but I guess you fabricate, eh?
You better bring more men than the Latter Day Saints
Manic states, Stephen Paddock with automatic, stay spray
at anything that may stand in they way as I stand at the bay window with a hand grenade
and a tre-eight at the Mandalay Bay, common sense, I'm a dollar short and a day late
James Holmes at the Saturday Batman matinee
Must have missed my cat-scan that day, I just threw a Tampax at Dre
Trashcan, Tascam and ashtray; I'm turnin back to a madman, can't take
anymore but I try to get away from the anger and rage, my basal ganglia is an A to the K
Get your ass sprayed like bidets, breakin your legs, ain't give aways ankle the ways
You chumps don't even know how to do somethin to give goosebumps a day when you say
that somethin you won't give someone a lump in their throat if you had them choked up you'd be yankin my chain
Feelin like I'm headed for a padded cell the, bar for me what I rap isn't fair but
Guess that's the standard I'm held to, but if somethin like that doesn't tell ya
You set a mark too high when platinum sales are, looked at as a failure
Then you better take it back to The Shelter and Hamburger Helper cause damn it I'm still the

[Chorus: Eminem]
Greatest in the world (yeah) greatest in the world (yeah)
Greatest in the world (yeah) no lie, I might be
Best to ever do it (yeah) best to ever do it (yeah)
Best to ever do it (yeah) I, feel like the greatest (yeah)
Woke up to honkies sounding like me
Never be as good (yeah) never be as good (yeah)
Packin up wife-beaters, white t-shirts
But-but I'm the greatest...

[Eminem]
So you sold 10 million albums, eh? (What?)
Only problem is, you put out 10 million albums, eh? (Haha) Wait, what was I just about to say?
Oh yeah, let me get this out the way, I know there's people that are pissed about the way
I misprounouced a name - "DIE ANTWOORD!" Fuck, I still can't say this shit
But how quickly they forget who the fuck I was, now Ninja try to duck my slugs
You let your girl get fucked by Muggs, I'd like to, give a shout to Cypress
This can't +Be Real+, you dissed me and I was just tryin to give you a shout
Now get the fuck out my rhyme book, no more shiners, already too much time chokin rappers
I hear you talkin shit, I'm just too big to respond to it
God forbid I forget, go and jump out the window, somebody better child-proof it
Cause if I lose it we can rewind to some old Ja Rule shit
And I can remind motherfuckers how I do shit, you don't got the tools, I got my toolkit
I bullshit you not, y'all fools just forgot that I'm so fuckin awful with the thoughts
And when I'm hostile and impossible to stop, so you can call it a nostril cause it's not
gonna, ever, I'll never let up on the pedal, might as well get the mop
Cause I'm wipin everyone up in this genre, cause on the mic I feel like I'm the

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
Oh yeah, and one more thing I want to mention (what) is you're one dimension
I'm a monkey wrench and I can flunk detention, I love contentions
So welcome to the gun convention, muscles flexin, gotta strut like a front suspension
You just stuck the key up in the ignition and gave me enough gas to flood my engine
(Yeah) Psychopath, Michael Jack's blowin up like a raft
I just slapped Vlad with a ISIS flag, bet you I come back twice as bad
(Uhh) "Revival" didn't go viral!
Denaun and Royce tell me that I should take the high road
Fuck that, I'm finna hit back 'til I run out of gun powder and split the scene
Hold the mic similar to pistol, squeeze and I shoot from the hip when I grip them things
And my lips and the clips got the cig' lit like it's nicotine, trigger me and Slim gets mean
Bars are like bullets when I spit them schemes, that's why I call the motherfuckers Em-16's
Float like a butterfly, I'm gonna sting like a bee, you ain't harmin a thing
I get a day hard as I'm gonna swing, I'm gonna need to put my arm in a sling
But like a wedding band you gotta be diamond to even climb in the ring
An anomaly, I'm Muhammad Ali, cause I knew one day I'm gonna be the

[Chorus]
