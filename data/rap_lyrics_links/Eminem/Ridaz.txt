[Intro: Eminem]
Aww man, yeah
You ever be in the club man, you get in a fight
People that you don't even know jump in

[Eminem]
You feel like you wanna hit somethin, your fist clenches, you're pissed
You just wanna get someone with shit, jump on this
You're 'bout to get your shit pushed in, I'm just inches away
from splittin your shit wide open, no stitches can save
You'll die with your eyes open, you hope this isn't the way
you end up goin out, but I guess it just is I'm afraid
Razors scissors and blades make Jason say "Isn't this great?"
On-lookers participate in this ass-kickin debate
that's startin to take place in the middle of the street
Little did you know there'd be an all-out brawl soon as you heard this beat
Emergency personnel rush to the murder scene but it's too late
It's absolute pandemonium, whisked away
in an ambulance is your fate
Nothin nobody told you when you left the house today coulda made you anticipate
such an ass-whippin, okay, 'til the anger dissipates
You get punched in the face, reciprocate; c'mon!

[Chorus: Eminem]
So what the deal ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feelin a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my brit-ches
I said, so what the deal ridaz?
Would you excuse me while I feel my nuts?
My balls are feelin a mighty big now
I might just have to dig down and pull 'em through my brit-ches

[Eminem]
You step in the place with enough misplaced anger to catch a case
Anxious to get in some shit, got your gangstas all with your ladies
You better go get your mase cause Shady said so
You may wanna pick up the radio and bang it against your face
That's how fuckin lighter you feel, now you still wanna grill?
If you don't wanna get the shit beat out of you, chill
Cause if you doubt me you will, yeah got me a pill, found me a thrill
I got a couple of drinks here, and I'm bound to refill
Girl howdy, how do you feel ma?
This cocksucker did not spill my drink, oh hell naw!
He must be tryin to kill my buzz
I will not budge, so what the deal ridaz?
Now here they all come and they got your back in like two seconds flat
And that's probably a record, yeah, you wasn't expectin that
Cause they want in on the act {*glass breaks*} there's a Cognac 
bottle, we snuck it in cause the beer that they was servin here was only tap
I'm bitin, I fight dirty
You might get kicked in the nuts, you're frightened like "This guy might hurt me"
You're quite certained he's nuts, I've hit myself in the face harder
Play smarter, you may start her over, you need a chainsaw to
dig your way out or go powder your nose
Pussy the louder you yell the harder I slap the shit outta you hoes
You set it off faggot so now how do you 'spose
we settle it, hit me in the nose, we'll see how it goes

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
It's sheer hustle, I bob, weave, deflate your beer muscles
We're tusslin, the crowd's startin to cheer us and
adrenaline's rushin through us just like a geyser gushin
Too much Budweiser in my blood, I'm stranglin your windpipe for nothin
My signature's ligature marks
Look at you all big with your remarks 'til I swing an icepick at your heart
At least that's what it feels like when I pick you apart
and dig at ya, and break you down like the bitch that you are
The predicament starts when I throw a brick at your car
The pain inflicted upon you is so sick as Bizarre
Shit this is almost ridiculous, addictive as far
as havin me wanna rip out your frickin ligaments, AHHH!
You hit like a bitch, you scratch me with your nails
For that, you catch an open hand slap like a female
Like BAP! In fact I'll have the crowd smackin you themselves
Where's D12? I don't feel like doin this by myself; c'mon!

[Chorus]

[Outro: Eminem]
Yeah, what the deal?
I'm feelin hard as hell right now homie
Almost feel, invincible and shit
Ay Dre, you got me feelin like
I can't be touched right now fool, ha ha
I'm unstoppable, damn
