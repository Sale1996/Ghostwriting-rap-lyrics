[Chorus: Rihanna]
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
Get along with the voices inside of my head
You're tryin to save me, stop holdin your breath
And you think I'm crazy; yeah you think I'm crazy

[Eminem]
I wanted the fame but not the cover of Newsweek
Oh well, guess beggers can't be choosy
Wanted to receive attention for my music
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me
for wantin my cake and eat it too, and wantin it both ways
Fame made me a balloon, cause my ego inflated when I blew, see
But it was confusing, cause all I wanted to do's be
the Bruce Lee, of loose leaf
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam
WOO! Hit the lottery, ooh-wee
But with what I gave up to get, it was bittersweet
It was like winnin a used mink
Ironic cause I think I'm gettin so huge I need a shrink
I'm beginnin to lose sleep - one sheep, two sheep
Goin cuckoo and kooky as Kool Keith
But I'm actually weirder than you think
Cause I'm

[Chorus]

[Interlude: Rihanna]
Well that's nothin!
Oh-ohhh oh-ohhh, oh-ohhh oh-ohhh
Oh-ohhh oh-ohhh, ohhh-ohhh-ohhhh
Well that's nothin!
Oh-ohhh oh-ohhh, oh-ohhh oh-ohhh
Oh-ohhh oh-ohhh, oh-ohhh oh-ohhh

[Eminem]
Now I ain't much of a poet
But I know somebody once told me to seize the moment and don't squander it
Cause you never know when it could all be over tomorrow so I keep conjurin
Sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from
"Yeah ponderin'll do you wonders
No wonder you're losin your mind the way it wanders"
Yodelodaley-hee-hoo! I think it went wanderin
off down yonder and stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen!
Cause I need an interventionist
to intervene between me and this monster
And save me from myself, and all this conflict
Cause the very thing that I love's killin me and I can't conquer it
My OCD's conkin me in the head, keep knockin
Nobody's home, I'm sleep-walkin
I'm just relayin what the voice in my head's sayin, don't shoot the messenger
I'm just friends with the

[Chorus]

[Interlude]

[Eminem]
Call me crazy but I have this vision
one day that, I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
But until then drums get killed and I'm 
comin straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and I'll
take you back to the days that, I get on a Dre track
Give every kid who got played that, pumped up feelin
and shit to say back, to the kids who played 'em
I ain't here to save the fuckin children
But if one kid, out of a hundred million
who are goin through a struggle feels it and relates, that's
great! It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin way back
in the draft, turn nothin into somethin, still can make that
straw into gold chump I will spin
Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack!
Maybe I need a straitjacket, face facts
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that!
It's nothin, I'm still friends with the

[Chorus] - 2X
