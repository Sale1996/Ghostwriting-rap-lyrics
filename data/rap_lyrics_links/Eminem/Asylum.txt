[Eminem]
Yea yea, yo, yo!
(This just in!)

[Chorus: Eminem]
The lunatics now run the asylum
The doctors are dead, nurses are tied up
They've taken it over and barricaded themselves inside it
The lunatics now run the asylum
I said the lunatics now run the asylum
The doctors are dead, nurses are tied up
They've taken it over and barricaded themselves inside it
The lunatics now run the asylum

[Joell Ortiz]
I walk around with O.J.'s glove knowin it fit
Fifth to the toilet, we takin over this shit
The Yaowa waited, salivated like "Man I know I can spit"
I was knockin for quite some time but y'all wouldn't open this bitch
You turn green when I enter, probably can't breathe
Now y'all trees in the winter, nobody can't leave
For all those that was doubtful I got a scalpel
and a mouth full of vowels that make a party stampede
You brag about swag and your feminine trends
I belittle your riddle, you Skittles with +Eminem's+ friends
So I ain't tryin to play wit'chu
This chainsaw crack jokes on Cain's brother brah, diss-Abel you
(Vroom) I'm an untamable animal
with aim from a movin train, I can graze your decayin tooth
And my strait-jacket just came unloose
So I'm reportin live, this is (breaking news!)

[Chorus]

[Crooked I]
Psycho like no bitch-made nigga
So this great nigga go insane
I got the switchblade to your throat, move it's not smart
I'll slice and watch you bleed all over the pop charts
Me and the Slaughters run the asylum
I'm feelin like DiCaprio rappin on +Shutter Island+
This industry is pussy, guess who gon' hit it the meanest
Give her the penis, hit the bitch in her Venus
To this game I'm addicted and fiendish
I'm predicted to bring this G shit, to it's pinnacle zenith
Lyrical genius, so sick with ridiculous English
Niggaz get squeamish when they hear this criminal linguist
Ah, fall back it's the takeover
Y'all wack and your cake over
I escaped from the padded room
Grab a broom, rape a male rapper's womb

[Chorus]

[Royce Da 5'9"]
I'm one as the worst happenin, the hurt moment when I'm purse snatchin
On purp' goin berserk bonin miss Nurse Ratchet
When we spit you get the pug face
Your bitch swallowed my $5 foot-long on a +Subway+
If sane people are rich, why should I sit around?
Play me and end up like the back of this hospital gown
Ass out - drink drink drink drink
Pass out - y'all feel me, right?
When I was young I was loud, I used to be like "I'LL KILL YA!!"
Now I be like, "You know I'll kill you, right?"
If y'all don't like it y'all can lick my dick
Cause we built this house we live in brick by brick

[Chorus]
