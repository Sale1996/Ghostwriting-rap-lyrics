[Announcer]
Okay
This is ANOTHER public service announcement
Brought to you in part...

{*Punch*} Yaarrggh!

[Rondell Beene]
Shut up punk! 

{* other members of D12 attempt to tie up the announcer and gag him *}

Yo, this thing on?
Good good hell yeah!
Look, I'm speaking on behalf of D12
And if you get offended by words like: -

Bitch
Ho
Sissy
Faggot
Homo
Lesbian
Fudge packer
Clit eater

All that shit like that
Then you should turn this shit off RIGHT now
Because that is some of the shit {* Duct tape tearing *} 
Nah that's the ONLY shit that you gonna hear, right here on this album
It's not that they don't have creativity
Or some shit like that, that ain't the case {* Duct tape tearing *}
We just like sayin shit like that, just to FUCK wit'cha! (Come here!)

{* Announcer tries to run away *}

'Ey! Wh.. I told you to hold him down, now he's running
wh.. fuck it! {*gun clicks then gunshot*}

{* Announcer falls down *}

God damnit! 
If you would have just stayed still
Nothing would have happened to ya!
It just goes to show when you fuck around with us
Shit can happen
