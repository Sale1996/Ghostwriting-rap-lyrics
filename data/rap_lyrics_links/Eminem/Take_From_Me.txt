"You're gonna be okay kid. You're gonna be, okay."

[Claret Jai]
Is everything not enough?
What more can I give up?
Is there anyone that I can trust?
I give you my all and you still take from me

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Uh, always been the type of dude that'd feed my clique
I know that without the fans I ain't shit, but y'all better read my lips
I don't spit raps this ill for you to just hack and steal, and leak my shit so peep my drift
I hope y'all don't think y'all helpin me out with that shit, that shit's stressin me OUT
Nickel Nine is blowin UP - Christmas time you should hang my album 
on top of your fireplace cause around that time my stockin is goin UP
Feels like a victory bittersweet, cause the bigger I get, the bigger the wedge
between the relationship of me and my bigger bro, hear what I said?
Feels like the shit was wished on me - everything I do for the nigga and the nigga know 
I would do anything for him but the nigga refuse to quit just straight SHITTIN on me
Keepin yo' distance probably best, if you don't wanna fuck with me
But you know me probably best, fuck pity
You want that? You know, it's Laila Ali chest, tough titty
The problem is you got a problem, you think that I'm already set
So I'ma look down on you, just be proud of me, you already got my respect
I ain't tryin to say somethin I'd regret, so I'ma just stop, chasin the pain
Let you deal with the fact that we don't get along cause I got a big face in the game
Sometimes I feel like fuck my LIFE - I fuck with a few niggaz 
that I know if my chick was a shady hoe, niggaz wouldn't think twice 'fore they fuck my WIFE
Guess that's the difference in friends and associates
I done been broke, I done been through the motions
I don't pay no attention to birds, I use my scope and I tend to the vultures
No one ever blows up your phone just to talk, I don't make money just to loan it to y'all
Tell a nigga that think you whylin is like dialin and then talkin to a hole in the wall
Please look at these expenses, these niggaz expensive
If I gotta lend you money every time I see you just to be ya friend bitch
I don't really need your friendship!

[Chorus: Claret Jai]
Is everything not enough?
What more can I give up?
Is there anyone that I can trust?
I give you my all and you still take from me
I give, and I give, and you take, and you take
And you just, walk away, without noth-ing to say
You just take from me, ay-ay, ayy
You just take from me, ay-ay, ayy
Ay-ay, ayy.. {*echoes*}

[Eminem]
I live, in a bubble, I struggle with the fame
Trouble is the pain, grows double, give a fuck what you say
When my music you take, so, subtle just to give it away
to people who don't even appreciate flows motherfucker, I'm livid today
Cause I break my back to give you my art
You steal my thoughts, it's like drivin a spike through my heart
You might not think it's that big of a deal to steal from me but music's all I got
Aside from my daughters, not to sound like a martyr but it's gettin harder than I thought
to not just go crazy trapped in this house, I'm about to just snap, am I not
deservin of what I got? Did I not work for it? Put it all on every record I record
Well then please tell me why on this earth Lord 
does it keep happenin? I keep rappin but I wonder sometimes is it worth all
the bullshit cause it feels like a down there ain't no gettin up from
But I won't let it get me down, I won't succumb, I'm anything but glum so FUCK 'EM~!
They'll appreciate me when I'm gone, they'll say I was ill, right? The way I killed mics
But the way I feel right now it just feels like 
I'm so done with this shit that I may as well wipe
I have nothin else to give you, nothin else to contribute, farewell I bid you
But before I go my last gift to you, ladies and gentlemen Slaughterhouse I GIVE YOU!

[Chorus]
