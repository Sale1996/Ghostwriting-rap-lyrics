[Intro: P!nk]
Mm-mm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm

[P!nk]
Like Leo in "The Revenant", Abel in that Bible bit
Revenge is sweet, isn't it? I really really hope for it
I know that it won't fix a thing, a song like this that I could sing
for you (mm-mm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm)
All the feels you make me do, a nightmare fucking comin true
I wish I was a lawyer, I would sue, you
Sue you, take your dog, take your house
Take your shoes, take your heart
Now here comes that singin part (mm-mm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm)

[Interlude: P!nk]
I'm daydreamin, let me count the ways
How I'll get you, or how I'll make you pay
(Mm-mm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm)
Babe I'm hurtin, and now you'll feel the same
That's my plan, that's my plan, that's my plan
Mm-hmm (mm-mm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm)

[Chorus: P!nk]
We could do revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge, together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet (mm-mm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm)
We could do revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge, together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet

[P!nk]
Now, now
Now here's where girlfriends come in hand especially those that understand
Crime's a crime but listen man, really cannot give a damn
We've all been through this kind of thing, say the word we make it sting
for him (mm-mm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm)
He can't just get away with it, eye for eye you piece of shhh
You treat us like a garbage pit, let me at him, wait for it
Wait for it, wait for iiiit
Here's that singin part again (mm-mm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm)

[Interlude] w/ ad libs

[Chorus]

[P!nk]
Revenge is sweet

[Eminem]
Well in the beginning we
felt like we was meant to be, I fell for you and skinned my knee
But hell with any injury, eventually you'll get up gingerly
Feels like it'll take a century to heal
But just know that I will {Mm-mm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm}
But fuck tryna make amends, I'd rather take revenge
You're stickin safety pins inside my atrium, your day begins at 8 PM
You'll hit the ATM in my Mercedes Benz
with all your lady, friends  whores
Hit the club and you go out, don't know a sum cause when I cal-
-culate the times you cheated and I total up all the amounts
It doesn't add up, cause you say that just givin out
your number doesn't count  get it? (I hate you)
Then see me with someone new, get mad and flip it, look how bad you spin it
First you turn your back on me then tell me that I stabbed you in it?
Stabbed you in it, stabbed you in it
Stabbed you in it, stabbed you in it (SLUUUUUT!)

[Eminem - singing]
So when you're driving, driving to his house
And you pass me, while I'm drivin to hers (hers) {*beep beep*}
Just remember, you cheated on me first (bitch)
You're a whore, you're a whore, this is war

[Chorus: P!nk + Eminem]
Fellas, ladies
We could do revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together (ohhh-ohhhhhh)
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet (so sweet, ohh)
We could do revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge together, together, together
We could take revenge, revenge, revenge
Revenge is sweet

[Outro: Eminem] + (P!nk)
Fuck yeah!
(Fuck no)
