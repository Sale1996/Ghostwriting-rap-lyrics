[Intro]
Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend

Now everyone report to the dance floor
To the dance floor, to the dance floor
Now everyone report to the dance floor
Alright stop, pajama time

[Verse 1]
Come here little kiddies on my lap
Guess who's back with a brand new rap
And I don't mean rap as in a new case
Of child molestation accusates
Ah ah ah ah ah, no worries
Papa's got a brand new bag of toys
What else could I possibly do to make noise?
I've done touched on everything but little boys
That's not a stab at Michael
That's just a metaphor, I'm just psycho
I go a little bit crazy sometimes
I get a little bit out of control with my rhymes
Good god, dip, do a little slide
Bend down, touch your toes, and just glide
To the center of the dance floor
Like TP for my bung hole
And it's cool if you let one go
Nobody's gonna know, who'd hear it?
Give a little "poot poot," it's ok
Oops my CD just skipped
And everyone just heard you let one rip

[Hook]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance
Yeah boy, shake that ass
Whoops I mean girl, girl girl girl
Girl you know you're my world
Alright now lose it (ah ah ah ah ah)
Just lose it (ah ah ah ah ah)
Go crazy (ah ah ah ah ah)
Oh baby (ah ah) oh baby (ah ah)

[Verse 2]
It's Friday and it's my day 
Used to party all the way to Sunday
Maybe 'til Monday
I don't know what day
Everyday's just a holiday
Cruisin' on the freeway, feelin' kind of breezy
Let the top down and my hair blow
I don't know where I'm goin'
All I know is when I ger there someone's gonna (touch my body)
Excuse me miss, I don't mean to sound like a jerk
But I'm feelin' just a little stressed out from work
Would you punch me in the stomach and pull my hair
Spit on me, maybe gouge my eyes out (yeah)
Now what's ya name girl, what's ya sign?
(Man you must be up out yo mind)
Dre (ah ah) beer goggles, blind
I'm just tryin' to unwind (now I'm)

[Hook]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance
Yeah boy, shake that ass
Whoops I mean girl, girl girl girl
Girl you know you're my world
Alright now lose it (ah ah ah ah ah)
Just lose it (ah ah ah ah ah)
Go crazy (ah ah ah ah ah)
Oh baby (ah ah) oh baby (ah ah)

[Verse 3]
It's Tuesday and I'm locked up
I'm in jail and I don't know what happened
They say I was runnin' butt naked
Down the street screamin' (ah ah ah ah)
Well I'm sorry, I don't remember
All I know is this much, I'm not guilty
They said "Save it, boy we got you on tape
Yellin' at an old lady" (touch my body)
Now this is the part where the rap breaks down
It's real intense, no one makes a sound
Everything looks like it's "8 Mile" now
The beat comes back and everybody lose themselves
Now snap back to reality, look it's B. Rabbit
Oh you signed me up to battle? I'm a grown man
Tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba tubba
I don't have any lines to go right here so tubba
Tellytubby fellas (what) fellas (what) 
Grab your left nut, make your right one jealous (what)
Black girls, white girls, skinny girls, fat girls
Tall girls, small girls, I'm callin' all girls
Everyone report to the dance floor
It's your chance for a little romance or butt squeezin'
It's the season, just go (ah ah ah ah)
It's so appeasin'

[Hook]
Now I'm gonna make you dance
It's your chance
Yeah boy, shake that ass
Whoops I mean girl, girl girl girl
Girl you know you're my world
Alright now lose it (ah ah ah ah ah)
Just lose it (ah ah ah ah ah)
Go crazy (ah ah ah ah ah)
Oh baby (ah ah) oh baby (ah ah)
