Big Proof, rest in peace dude and we love you
We just wanna keep makin you proud
P-P-P-P-P-P-P

[Proof] (Eminem)
My life is trapped in these line's, that's why I'm packin these nine's
I gotta rap I ain't dyin', that's in the back of my mind
Got a strap made of iron, can't relax on his grind
Bendin' over backwards for these slackers, 'til I'm snappin' my spine
Natural high, gotta focus, on these bogus poachers
Lookin' over my shoulder, Proof get it poppin' like soda, hold up
(We nothin' but soldier's!)
Slow up
(This gun is loaded!)
Roll up
(They beefin' we leavin' 'em coked up!)
If Em say it, I spray it, if he will it, I kill it
We kill packs to get iller in Detroit, hope y'all can feel it
Real as this gun on my waistline, and woah we don't waste time
(Ja) mad he can't take a punch and 50 can take nine
We got school craft here at the 7, 8, and text her
I'm up in Holly, spendin' dollas, ain't feelin' no pressure
Yes sir, your texture is bitch, betcha' you flinch
When Proof shoot up they coupe, and waste your whole clique
