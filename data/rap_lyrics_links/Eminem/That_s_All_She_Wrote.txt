[Chorus One: T.I.]
Now I don't really care what you call me
Just as long as you don't call me rude
I bet they knew as soon as they saw me
Good night it's over with, that's all she wrote
The streets like cold Chicago
Ain't nothin new, I seen it all befo'
But still I ball like no tomorrow
Good night it's over with, that's all she wrote

[Interlude: T.I.]
All she wrote, all she wrote
I said it's over with, that's all she wrote
All she wrote, all she wrote
Good night it's over with, that's all she wrote

[T.I.]
Yeah, ay
It's stupid how I go in knowin everybody knowin
that I'm sewin up the game, destroyin life, they hate me for it
Eventually see they can't beat then with me they join
Others sworn under oath or banished left completely scorn
You tell lies, get cut, nigga kick rocks
You never did blend in with the big shots
On a fast track, ain't no need for no pit stop
I just laugh at, nigga wishin they was this hot
Guess they mad at me, huh? Really pissed off
Better that than pissed on; I'm the Jetsons you the Flintstones
Catch me in the end zone, high-steppin primetime
Thought you niggaz been known, ain't no blockin my shine
Like my new Air Yeezy's you can see me in the nighttime
I get rich off livin life, you check-to-check recitin rhymes
So call me what you want, wanna hate? Have a nice time
While I get stupid paper, hey my dough ain't in its right mind, mind, mind

[Chorus One]

[Eminem]
You're starin straight into a barrel of hate, terrible fate
Not even a slim chance to make a narrow escape
Cupid shot his arrow and missed, wait, Sarah you're late
Your train left, mascara and egg smear on your face
Night's over, goodbye hoe, I thought that I told ya
that spilled nut ain't nothin to cry over
Never shoulda came within +Range+ of my Rover
Should known I was trouble soon as I rolled up
Any chick who's dumb enough after I blindfold her
She still come back to the crib, must want me to mess with her mind, hold up
She mistook me for some high roller when I won't even buy her soda
Unless it's Rock & Rye cola (Satan's cheaper)
Buy you a bag of Fritos? I wouldn't let you eat the fuckin chip on my shoulder!
If you was bleach and I was hair I wouldn't dye/die for ya
Tryin to pull five bucks from me is like tryin to pull five molars
You get your eyes swole up, I'm on my straight grizzly
So why would I buy you a gay ass teddy bear bitch? You're already bi-polar!

[Chorus Two: Eminem]
Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
These bitches know soon as they saw me
It's never me they'll get the privilege to know
I roll like a desperado
I don't ever know where I'm finna go
Still I ball like there's no tomorrow
Until it's over and that's all she wrote

[T.I.]
The credit rollin, curtain closin, movie over with (that's it)
But don't get mad at me, go blame the chick who wrote this shit
Your life is sure a bitch, but she know I'm rich (I'm rich)
That's why she give me what I want and I just throw her dick
Here I go again, I kick this shit, dividend got it pourin in
Peso, euro, yen - ah-ha I'm paid, never gon' be broke again
See me posted in, anythang, wearin any chain
Never gon' see me totin anythang, all you gon' see is BANG!
It's so nice where I kick it, hate you never get to visit
Yeah I'm on another level but you niggaz still can get it
It's all over 'fore you finished, sorry bro this where we end it
Won't give you the satisfaction of me giving you the business

[Eminem]
Yeah I guess life is a bitch, ain't it Tip? And each one thinks they the shit
Shirt off my back? I wouldn't give you the dirt off my hankerchief
I'm givin these hoes a dose of they own medicine, let 'em get a good taste of it
I'm sure you got that relationship memo by now but in case you didn't
This shit's so bad better stick your nose to your forehead and staple it
Life is too short and I got no time to sit around just wastin it
So I pace this shit a little bit quicker, that clock I'm racin it; double timin it
but I still spit triple the amount of insults in a tenth of the time that it may take you pricks
to catch on, while you strong-arm like Stretch Armstrong
Man I still say K-Mart's like there's an apostrophe-S on it dawg
And they say McDonald's isn't a restaurant, well I guess I'm wrong
But if you're gonna tell me that A&W ain't the spot for the best hot dogs you can get the F on dawg

[T.I.]
Ha ha ha, and on my throne I remain, all alone in my lane
I'm as strong as they came, they were gone 'fore they came
Now I don't wanna hang, I slap five with them rap guys
They just wanna sabotage my hustle shawty that's why, why, why

[Chorus Three: Eminem] + (T.I.)
Now I don't really care what you call me
You can even call me cold
(I bet they knew as soon as they saw me)
(Good night it's over with, that's all she wrote)
I roll like a desperado
And I don't ever know where I'm gonna go
(But still I ball like there's no tomorrow)
(Good night it's over with, that's all she wrote)
