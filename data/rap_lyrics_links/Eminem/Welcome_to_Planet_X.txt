[Intro: Eminem]
I live in a world, that's different than your world
Your world still believes in things like free speech and democracy
Those things don't exist in my world anymore
Welcome to my world
Welcome to Planet X motherfucker

[KXNG Crooked]
It used to be parks
It used to be jungle gyms
Now they just stories passed down orally
from my great-grandmother an' 'em
It used to be public pools
Kids loved to swim 'til the summer's end
Now it's enough poison in the water to slaughter your son and your daughter
You could blame the government
Let me tell you how it all started
The middle class was evaporated
Then the filthy rich couldn't stand the stench of the dirt poor
Of course who had the world oversaturated
So a new world order was activated
No more black, no more white, no more brown, no more yellow, no more red
Just high born citizens, and low born citizens
And all that race shit was eradicated
You're either rich or you're poor now
Digital identity chip implanted in everybody born now
Bein poor is like fightin a war now
No energy to fight the real enemy because you're worn out
Livin life on a tight rope
But the trickery is the tight rope, it's slippery as a ice slope
Every second somebody is fallin off
So we figure we embrace the misery, nigga we never liked hope
Cause hope was the buzzword
that they use to brainwash us, fuck that, we unlearn
Now the rich people concerned
cause they know our return is confirmed by holdin a gun firm
What's that in the distance?
You fucked the slums raw 'til they gave birth to a resistance
You scared lookin out your window
You see your own fuckin children crawlin over your fences

[Chorus: The Observer]
One by one, they all come, slow to meet their fates
Two by two I bury them, in their shallow graves
Three by three they've come at me, their guns and swords were drawn
Now four by four before the Lord, they'll choose a witchy spawn
Cause we're coming for you (coming for you, coming for you)
La la la la la, we're coming for you
La la la la la, we're coming for you

[KXNG Crooked]
Yo, what you gon' do now?
It's too late for talkin, I'm in your face with the tool out
Foot wearin the other shoe now
The chickens came home to roost now, who got the juice now?
Aiyyo, what you gon' do now?
You wanna truce now, I'm in your face with the tool out
Foot wearin the other shoe now
The chickens came home to roost now, who got the juice now?
(Oil addiction, water polution)
Who got the juice now?
(Soil contamination, and overconsumption)
Tell me who got the juice now?
(Wiped out two-thirds of the planet's fresh water)
Who got the juice now?
(And crop reserves, creating a vast wasteland)
Who got the juice? (On a global scale)

[Chorus] w/ ad libs
