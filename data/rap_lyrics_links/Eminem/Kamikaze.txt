[Intro: Eminem]
(Fack) Okay (fack)
How do I say this? (fack)
Last year (fack) didn't work out so well for me (fack)
Fack last year (fack)
2018 (fack) well (fack) ha

[Eminem]
Yeah, I'm a fuckin kamikaze crashin into everything
You beat me, Islamic Nazi, that means there is no such thing
I've been goin for your jugular since Craig G "Duck Alert"
Wedgie in my underwear, the whole bed sheet and the comforter
Stuck up in my rectal crack, kiss my disrespectful ass
I'll ride through your cul-de-sac, window cracked, bumpin your reference tracks
You-you collaborative effort rap, I-I have never said his raps
O-overstayed my welcome, stepped in crap and ruined your welcome mat
So spit that shit from the heart, you didn't write like you wrote it (wrote it)
While I teabag the microphone cause I go nuts on it (on it)
Like a fighter jet lined with explosives that'll strike any moment
Headed right at opponents and I'm the fuckin pilot that flown it
I'm 'bout to

[Chorus: Eminem]
Smash into everyone, crash into everything
Back and I've just begun, +FACK+ 2017
Fack, fack on everyone, fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone - I'm a, kami-kaze, gonna
Smash into everyone, crash like an F-15
Damage already done, y'all shoulda let me be
Fack, fack on everyone, fack, fack on everyone
Fack, fack on everyone - I'm a, kami-kaze, gonna

[Eminem]
I turned to rap cause it made me feel tough when I wasn't (wasn't)
From the moment I heard rap was cussin, I was in (was in)
Which is why I identify with the guy who I was invented by, Dre's Frankenstein
Energized like a 9-volt, ice cold like snake eyes twice in a row on a dice roll
But if the only reason I blowed is cause I'm white though
Why don't every other white rapper sell what I sold? (ooh)
Kamikaze pilot, I wrote my suicide note, here come the guys in white coats
tryin to stop me 'fore I jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes
Cause I'm takin y'all with me when I go cyclone, I don't think this typhoon's
letting up any time soon, here I go, eyes closed, blindfolded
I'm 'bout to

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
Smash! {"Ka-kamikaze"}
{"Ka-kamikaze kamikaze"}
{"Kami-kam-kamikaze kamikaze"}
{"Kami-kamikaze"}
{"Look at what I've done"}

[Eminem]
I heard your freestyle on Shade 45, that shit was embarrassing
There is no way we ever air that shit again, I guarantee
That way that shit was so ass, it's somethin we wouldn't derrier/dare re-air
And that shit's embarrassing as me rear-ending Tara Reid bare
In my therapy chair, my dick is the hair length of Cher
Each nut is the chair width of an acorn, stairlift beware of me
Lyrically I'm terrible, better get your lyrics prepared
Richard Ramirez is here, serial killin every beat there is

{*beat changes*}

Wait, wait, got the eeriest feelin
Somethin evil is lurkin, I'm no conspiracy theorist
But somethin here is afoot - oh yeah, it's my dick
Get the measurin stick (what?) 12 inches of wood!
Wait, but I've been goin for your jugular since Craig G "Duck Alert"
And I've come to pay respects cause if you sleep you're fucked, other words
You get laid to rest, and I hope your butt is hurt
Put me on a track I go cray-on it like a color book
You got some +Views+, but you're still below me
Mine are higher, so when you compare our views, you get overlooked
And I don't say the hook unless I wrote the hook
And now I'm just freestylin in the vocal booth
And you know I've always spoke the truth
You lyin through your teeth so much you broke a tooth
And it ain't somethin I need a phone to do
When I say I can't wait 'til I get ahold of you
And I don't know what I'm s'posed to do
Line up the rappers, take my pic like a photo shoot
