 "Don't kill me!"
"Hurry the fuck up! {*shoots the teller*} Thank you! {*running*}
Go, go, go! What the.. fuck? The fuck he go? {*cars peels off*}
Mothafucka bail on me?! Fuck you! {*gets in car; car stops working*}
Aw, you gotta be fuckin' kiddin' me! {*police car sirens*}
Are you fuckin' kiddin' me?! Shit! {*gets out of car; runs, hops fence*}
{*dog barking*} Get off! {*cocks gun, shoots dog*} Ha-ha~!
{*sound of sirens*} Parking lot! Shit, ah!"
 "Let me see your hands, bend over!"
"Ah, fuck it!" {*shoots himself*}
