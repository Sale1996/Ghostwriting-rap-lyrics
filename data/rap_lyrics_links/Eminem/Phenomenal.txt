[Chorus: Eminem] + (Liz Rodrigues)
I AM PHENOMENAL! {*echoes*}
With every ounce of my blood, with every breath in my lungs
Won't stop until I'm pheno-menal
I AM PHENOMENAL! {*echoes*}
However long that it takes, I'll go to whatever lengths
It's gonna make me a monster though
I AM PHENOMENAL! {*echoes*}
But I'll never say (ohh it's impossible)
Cause I'm gonna be
PHENOMENAL! {*echoes*}

[Eminem]
Unstoppable, unpoppable thought bubbles
Untoppable thoughts, fuckin juggernaut that'll
stomp you in a verse
Obstacles I'm drawn to 'em, when the going got rough
Show 'em what I done thought that was the worse
Lil' sissy, who the fuck taught you how to per-
-severe? There ain't no situation that you ever had to respond to that's adverse
The messiest thing you've ever gone through is your purse
Yeah, I don't try like hell but I might as well hang it up like a shelf
Gotta keep growin with it, evolve
Cause you can keep throwin shit at the wall
But you're gonna find that nothing's gonna stick until you apply yourself!
Time to slip in that zone 'til I find myself
inside the realm where the unknown and boldly go
In the waters where nobody else has gone before
or willin to go, uncharted, feelin is so
bomb, I'm feelin myself, I'm a giant
Sometimes I gotta remind myself that

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
Let me self-empower you
When you're down and they're tryin to clown the fuck out of you
When you feel like you're runnin out of fuel
I'll show you how to use doubt as fuel, convert it to gunpowder too
Now what you do is put the match to the charcoal fluid
Put a spark to it like Martha Stewart barbecuing
Aww screw it, feel like you wanna hit that wall then do it
Punch through it, just cock back, put your ALL into it
Now, you gon' take that rage and make that what you raise
Never take back what you say
If you stay strapped in your brain, engage in this steel cage match
Ready to scrap ASAP
Take your fists to his bones, show who's +Big+ and who's smallest
You're Christopher Wallace, yeah I picture 'em all as
plastic and foam and it lays flat where you put your dinner plates at
And set it on it like a placemat!
... And I want you to SAY that!

[Chorus]

[Liz Rodrigues]
Step into the unknown
And find yourself your glory
Free the ignoring person

[Eminem]
Got a fuckin mouth, with no shut-off valve
Can't even cut a power to it, but it's what allowed
me to come up out from under the fuckin ground cause I worked my butt off now
It's a subject that I don't know how to shut up about
Cause I stuck it out
Like a motherfuckin tongue, that's how I responded when I got shoved around
You're gonna have non-believers
But when you're beyond belief you probably shouldn't wonder how
Get it how you live
But are you prepared to give more than you get?
And put in twice what you get back from this shit
Though what you sacrifice barely is half, never give, rap is my shiv
But it's like my shield at the same time I wield
I'ma knife this will, sometimes I feel just like B. Real from Cypress Hill
How I can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt
I rhyme like life is still
an uphill climb, ready to face it, each challenge waitin
Can taste it, it's salivation, I'm wagin retaliation
Look what I have built, reputation is validation
The only thing I'm capable of makin is amazing
Only thing you're capable of makin is a false statement
An accusation - I'm legendary status
In fact, that is the only way you'll ever be able to say
Your legend is, makin an allegation!
I write with the left
Same hand I hold the mic with, as I fight to the death
'til my last breath, managed
to prove who the best man is, prevailin
All cards be the only one left standin
In the end, but I ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage
of knowin what it's like to be +Southpaw+
Cause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed!
Cause

[Chorus]
