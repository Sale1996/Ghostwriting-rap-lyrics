[Eminem]
Said you want a little company
And I love it cause the thrill's cheap
Said you left him for good this time
Still if he knew I was here he'd wanna KILL ME
But it's time you met the real me
Filthy, but wasn't always will be
Your pill re-fill and I'll still be
your addiction, you can touch a prescription but don't fill/feel me
I let you see my dark side
But like a mic check, you got one two/too
So when the sparks fly
We hit the flight deck and got sprung, pew
Like an ejector seat, from an F-15
But tonight we don't need those pills, just the effects of each
other, but we gon' film
Cause I will want your ex to see
(Get it?) That

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
I only call you when it's half, past, five
The only time that I'll be by, your, side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only call you when it's half, past, five
The only time I'd ever call, you, mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

[Eminem]
And every time he hurt you, I heard you
Was your shoulder to cry on
And I'll be damned if I weren't who, you turn to
You said he drove you to my arms
But don't ya (don't ya) remember when I told ya (told ya)
I would never let down my guard
And I hope ya (hope ya) feel like dirt when I hold ya (hold ya)
Cause is it really over?
But you just want a little company
And you just really want a thrill seek
Said you left him for good this time
Bullshit, what your friends do, spill beans?
Or you just wanna be guilt-free, and still creep
But these hills see, from that POV
We can touch but the only way you'll film me
is with a camera, feel me?
You're nothin but a barfly
You got your sights set, on the one who you run to
But I'm a far cry
from what you might get, if we come true
So keep textin me
But at night, if you seek those thrills, what I expect to be?
Cause if you cheat on him, just means I will be the next to be
Your ex, so no complexities
Just sex, and don't lecture me
Just accept, that

[Chorus]

[The Weeknd]
Hills have eyes, the hills have eyyyyyyyes
Who are youuuuu to judge? Who are youuuuu to juuuudge?
Hide your lies, girl hide your liiiiiiies
Only youuuuu to trust, only youuuuuu

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Ewedihalehu
Yene konjo, ewedihalehu
Yene fikir, fikir, fikir, fikir
Yene fikir, fikir, fikir, fikir
Ewedihalehu
Yene konjo, ewedihalehu {*fades out*}
