Hmm, yeah
This just one of them days when yo' ass just wanna chill out
and motherfuckers be all in yo' ear and shit, yknowhatI'msayin?
Or that naggin bitch, that just like to hear herself talk
blowin all yo' high away
Now that's some fucked up shit, heh
but it happens, yknowhatI'msayin? Yo

[Eminem]
Yo yo yo yo
Schizophrenia, how many of ya got it?
How many motherfuckers can say they psychotic?
How many motherfuckers can say they brain dry-rotted from pot?
You got it like I got it or not?
If you did, you would know just what I'm talkin bout
When your tongue's rottin out from cotton-mouth
When you end up becomin so dependent on weed
that you end up spendin a G in the vendin machine
You got the munchies, look at you, junk food junkie
Potato chips and lunch meat, up in the front seat
Sometimes you can get so paranoid from ganja
that's it gotcha thinkin the whole world is watchin ya
Or maybe you don't smoke, maybe you just roll
But whatever your drug's yo, go for the gusto
Just don't, come fuck with me when I'm doin my drugs
You see me in the club don't come fuckin my high up and

[Chorus: D-12]
Blow, my, buzz
You want to want to just don't blow, my, buzz
(Do what you want to) And I'm gon' sit here and just roll, my, drugs
(Smoke my weeeeed) And if you talk I'm gonna fuck, you, up
(I might just whoop yo' ass) Just don't say shit and we'll be cool

[Bizarre]
{*ding dong*} Bitch let me in the house (Avon?)
No, I just came to eat your mother out
It's the big guy, doin a butterfly to the ground (go 'head!)

[Eminem] Bizarre sit yo' nasty ass down

[Bizarre]
I spot this fat bitch from across the room
Now suck my dick while your boyfriend's in the bathroom (yea yea!)
My face is pink, lookin for a sink
And don't worry bout what I put in your drink
It's called a date-rape drug, ten minutes you'll be fucked up
Open your nasty-ass legs up (yeah you whore)
Bitches I'm catchin, blunts I'm matchin
Don't call me Bizarre, I'm the Reverand Jesse Jackson

[Swifty McVay]
Who the fuck is this guy, why the hell you in my presence?
It'd be cool if you was askin me some reasonable questions
But you on some bullshit nigga, this yo' last beer (f'real)
Get the fuck off my dick and tell yo' bitch to bring here ass here
I kick a hoe out without givin her cabfare
And leave her barefooted just for naggin in my damn ear
When I'm out eatin, you fags'll interfere
They don't go until I let 'em know a mag' is sittin here
I get drunk and I smoke weed, whatcho' ass wanna hear?
I didn't answer you clear, I met Manson this year okay?
You want some yea?  I'll front yo' ass a play
But other than that, get the hell out my face
Because you niggaz tryin to

[Chorus] w/ variations

[Kun] Yo Denaun you seem shook
[Kon] I really am dawg look
This fat bitch keep chasin me tryin to give me the nook
[Kun] Aww man you probably lead her on
[Kon] I just bought her a beer!
[Kun] I saw her rubbin on your head while she was wipin your tears
[Kon] I admit, I was high, but you ain't seen me cryin
[Kun] Nigga you lyin, and you blowin my high, just stop denyin it
[Kon] Well at least somebody in this bar is, this big bitch did
the ultimate by sayin she wanted to have my kids
[Kun] Look man you grown, just leave me alone, I'm in the zone
Call it a night, get stoned, and take that fat slut home
Just drink the drink, hit the dank, do some drugs
Go kill yourself
[Kon] Fuck you!
[Kun] Well stop blowin my buzz!

[Proof]
I'm at the front of the bar by the lounge in the back
with a slut on my arm while I'm downin the 'gnac
Got the pills in my system, floatin around
Everytime I start driftin, someone open they mouth
Yo my ear been spit licked and freestyled in
I think I'm goin def like old senile men
Only one good demo out of three thousand
(Yo I ain't wanna rap for you anyway, so keep talkin)
Next nigga that bump me, I'ma do the Humpty
and elbow bitches, 'til everybody jump me

(Yo man whassup wit you man why you keep bumpin me and shit)
Whassup fool?  Fuck you punk!
(Motherfucker, the fuck? It's on fool it's on! Whassup then nigga?)

[Chorus] w/ variations

We'll be cool
We'll be cool if you don't talk while I'm just tryin to smoke my weed
Smoke my weed..
I'm tryin to drink with my niggaz; just shut the fuck up
while I'm just tryin to get blowed
Spittin to me some mo'.. (hehehe)
