[Chorus: Swifty McVay]
"I'm an instigator" - nigga can't you see?
"I'm an instigator" - ain't nobody worse than me
"I'm an instigator" - I'll be the first to beef
first to squeeze, take heed to the words I speak
"I'm an instigator" - nigga can't you see?
"I'm an instigator" - ain't nobody worse than me
"I'm an instigator" - I'll be the first to beef
first to squeeze, 'til it hurts to breathe, fuck with me

[Kuniva]
I love gettin shit started
I instigate a peace talk into a beef talk until police need chalk
to chalk you up, have bitches walkin up
Smackin you in your face, screamin that you talk too much
Tell women you said you fucked 'em
Tell the hardest nigga you said you snuck him
Ran his pockets and stuck him
'Til they gather in front of your crib, guns and long clips
Laughin when they shoot at you over the wrong shit
I lock down your block with lies that's so believable
you'll run and grab your shotguns, glocks and nines (whattup)
Walkin blind, excite fights until they erupt (do it!)
Instigate my own death cause killin you ain't enough

[Swifty McVay]
I don't give a fuck if we beefin or not, I'll squeeze first
I'ma heat up yo' spot, I'm a nigga that breathe dirt
On these streets every day, snatchin niggaz yea
How you bitches needin work, you can get it from McVay
I'm dispiteful, I tie a hoe a maniacal foul animal
liable to leave you strapped with yo' bible (fo' real)
I'm psycho, my bullets won't fly by you
You wanna kill me? {*explosion*} You got the right to
Ain't gotta wait 'til night to snipe if I don't like you
You gettin hit in broad daylight with a white rifle
In front of yo' window I'm lookin right through
I love when I see a nigga get stuck..

[Chorus]

[Kon Artis]
"I'm an instigator" - drama tends to follow me
I know, I probably owe all of my friends apologies
Lie to every bitch just to get her to swallow me
Get a lobotomy nigga this one's to my arteries
Guns are a part of me I pack more than pottery
I oughta be jailed for depicted mockery
Egg on fights to plot on the niggaz that shot at me
I don't twist the truth I just make it gothic see
I'm nothin but a liar with a big-ass mouth
Dick and fists big enough to knock your bitch-ass out
Got no reason to tell you the truth
But to be honest with you I rap with him but I don't like Proof

[Proof]
Nigga fuck you, me and Swift got plans to jump you
Type of nigga to shake your hand and stomp you
"I'm an instigator" - convince a tenth grader
to run up inside his classroom and leave the kids..
Bitch wait up, this is the season
for squeezin off triggers on niggaz for no reason
Either jump or quit runnin your mouth
Pull a gun out, but I use it 'til the bullets run out

[Chorus]

[Swifty McVay]
I throw a brick at your crib, have you standin on the porch
screamin, "Look what you did!" I ain't feelin no remorse
Nigga just pick up the kids, and Swift got first dibs
with these cherry hot slugs that'll barbecue your ribs
I'm preparin deathbeds, quick to bust lead
while I'm starin at the Feds, tearin off they legs
Once you drop dead they'll be swearin it's a plague
I'm sicker than a coke rastafarian with dreads
You get shanked if you move, ditched with no clues
Don't put shit on yo' tape but yo' skits and interludes
And once I finish you they wouldn't put it in the news
I'm nuts so you hoes ain't got the GUTS to interview

[Chorus]
