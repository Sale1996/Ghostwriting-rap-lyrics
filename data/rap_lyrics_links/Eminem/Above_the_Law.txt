[Intro: Claret Jai]
The poor stays poor, the rich get richer
It's just so disproportionate...
(Get outta here!)

[Chorus: Claret Jai]
Sometimes life seems so unfortunate
That's why I don't give a shit
The poor stay poor, the rich get richer
It's just so disproportionate
You don't know just what I go through
That's why I would rather show you
just how far that I can take it
Every rule I'm breakin it

[Eminem]
Tearable but not rippable, invincible I hung invisible
Fuckin mistletoe over the world
I stuck my ass up under it, now pucker up them lips and kiss it hoe
Here we go, Bad and Evil so you know how this'll go
The competition's miserable, we stomp them bitches, this is no
joke, goin overboard like someone threw us off the boat
Choke, cough from all the smoke - I'm tryin to stay on fire
so you know if I hate fuckin water sprinklers I don't love the hose/hoes
Someone let the cat out the bag, now it's time to stuff its face
back in that bitch, smother that little motherfucker 'til it suffocates
YOU had long enough of a wait, why are they
tryin to be so secretive? Bad and Evil is reunited, hey!
Came back to annihilate, the game's in dire straits as I await
Word on Satan as I drop, fall to my knees before this Ouija board and I pray
Now I lay me down to sleep
I do this shit in my sleep, I'm sleepin now, imagine if I awake!
I'm champ bitch, I'll never taste the canvas
Could never be no damn wuss or pussy, never mushy so you can't squish
Nowhere near a tush, in fact if I jump out a bush
in a sneak attack's the only way I'll say I am-Bush
Outlandish, these +Words Are Weapons+ that I brandish
Standoffish to hoes, keep your hands off this
Can't top it, so what the fuck would I sugarcoat it for? Law? FUCK protocol!
I'd holler at this hoe, but now my throat is sore

[Chorus]

[Eminem] Royce!

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Baby I'm lawless, you couldn't burn me if you threw acid on me
I'm at you homie, I'm at your home ready to spray you while you nappin homie
Have everything on and around your mattress
lookin like the word in front of a matrimony
You high, thug yeah - go 'head jump
No matter how high you get, you gon' come up short like Spud Webb
My DUI's get waived/waved like sayin bye
Still ridin with no L's like James Todd; can't change I
I thank God for my safe thinkin
Last time I was safe thinkin me and my niggaz was doin a bank job
I stay violent, y'all go the peace route
You got a mouth like Kanye, I'll knock your whole bottom row of teeth out
No disrespect to Mr. West, shit I'm just nice with mine
And this just rap, I'm just like Ricky Hatton, I just like the line
These weak rappers wanna set us up, they never tough
They ask me for a hook, I tell 'em left or right, head or GUT?
What y'all messin with is
a nigga that'll leave you FUBAR, Fucked Up Beyond All Recognition
Y'all are rock stars, I'm the opposite, I could just
throw a rock and hit a star, for the FUCK of it!
Partner you not hard, I'll body ya hot bars
Beef is left you pray, right, like Allahu Akbar
Let's go, when I leave y'all shot
You ain't gon' be on your Metro in a bad area, that call dropped

[Chorus]
