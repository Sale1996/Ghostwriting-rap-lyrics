[Intro]
"Hey look let me tell y'all somethin, aight?
 What I do, I do, straight like that.
 So ain't no sense in y'all even troublin y'all selves over that.
 Cause man the way I feel right now today..."

[Denaun]
I came up on the wrong side of the fence
I gave my family pain and strife and asked them all for strength
But hell in my defense
And I got too much way too fast, momma told me it won't last
Now I'm back down on the bottom wishin that I took another path
I should've listened, but my mind was gone
My temper too quick so when my fuse get lit yo when it's on, it's on
Yeah, e'rybody wrong, yeah, and I'm always right
Yeah, ain't nobody to blame now, it's me vs. me, man this my fight

[Chorus: Denaun]
So don't look at me
like I am the same person I was before, fore, fore
Now, we all deserve a second chance
And this time I think I can do more, more, more
Or better

[Interlude: Denaun]
Yeah I put that on my family
All you gotta do is give me the chance (me the chance)
And I can show you that I'm worthy of the trust that you require
Put it all on my shoulders, I'm a fighter, I won't get tired
When I'm back up in this corner
Back up in this corner, tryna get out
Back up in this corner
Back up in this corner, gotta get out!

[Denaun]
You think I got none but I got all kind of sense
Stop judgin my book by the cover, maybe you should do a little reconnaissance
And I ain't tryna vent
This ain't woe is me, it's nothin owed to me
Keep the swan song, I don't need an ode to me
Shit, hopefully holdin this rosary
will keep me out of close calls with the old police
I said I'm tryna be a whole new me, I ain't tryna do the same old thing
I'm tryna prove to my family that I will not bring
no more trouble around, I ain't gotta do nothing but stay out of shit
I ain't gotta be up in the chaotic, it's
probably cause it's my redemption, that I'm entrenched in
And I won't let anybody deny my vision, it's my decision
But y'all ain't listenin (but y'all ain't listenin)

[Chorus]

[Interlude]

[Denaun]
It's my gameplan now
Is to get in this ring and show that I'm a changed man and how
I won't blow another chance to make you proud
Even though you got the right to hate me now
I know you lost your hope in me, but hopefully
I can restore that back where it's supposed to be
I just want my daughter back, this fight mean much more than that
I'm tryna think before I react
I ain't get the message at first, I tried to ignore the facts
But I'm much older, she's my soldier, I told ya, I'd go to war for that
I said the boy is the truth and it's no lie in him
All he need is his family with him
Y'all want him 'til it's no room given
I'ma hit him 'til the ref come and get him

[Chorus]
