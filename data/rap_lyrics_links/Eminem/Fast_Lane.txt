Uhh, first verse uh, I'm armed 'til I'm on an island
My life's ridin on the Autobahn on auto-pilot
Before I touch dirt
Or kill y'all with kindness, I kill ya! My natural persona's much worse
You've been warned if you been borned or if you conformed
Slap up a cop and then snatch him out of his uniform
Leave him with his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on
And hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn
Y'all niggaz intellect mad slow, y'all fags know
Claimin you bangin, you flamin
Bet you could light your own cigarette with your asshole
Me and Shady deaded the past so that basically resurrected my cash flow
I might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke
Though I ain't wrapped tight
My blood type's the '80s, my '90s was like the Navy
You was like the Brady's, you still fly kites daily

[Eminem]
Catch me in my Mercedes bumpin "Ice Ice Baby"
Screamin Shady 'til I die, like a half a pair of dice, life's crazy
So I live it to the fullest 'til I'm Swayze
And you only live it once, so I'm thinkin 'bout this nice nice lady
Wait don't stop me now 'fore I get on a roll - danish
Let me tell you what this pretty little dame's name is cause she's kinda famous
And I hope that I don't sound too heinous when I say this
Nicki Minaj, but I wanna stick my penis in your anus!
You morons think that I'm a genius, really I belong 
inside a dang insane asylum; came to drive them
trailer parks crazy, I am back and I am razor sharp, baby
And that's back with a capital B with an exclamation mark, maybe
you should listen when I flip the linguistics cause when I rip this mystical slick shit
You don't wanna become another victim or statistic of this shit
Cause after I spit the bullets I'ma treat these shell casings like a soccer ball
I'ma kick the ballistics; so get this dick! I'ma live this

[Chorus: Sly Jordan]
I'm livin life in the fast lane
Movin at the speed of life and I can't slow down
Only got a gallon in the gas tank
But I'm almost at the finish line so I can't stop now
I don't really know where I'm headed, just enjoyin the ride
Just gon' roll 'til I drop and ride 'til I die
I'm livin life in the fast lane (pedal to the metal)
Livin life in the fast lane (pedal to the metal)

[Royce Da 5'9"]
Uhh, yeah
My whole goal as a poet's to be relaxed in orbit
At war with a bottle as Captain Morgan attacks my organs (c'mon)
My slow flow is euphoric, it's like I rap endorphins
I made a pact with the devil that says "I'll let you take me
You let me take a shovel, dig up the corpse of Jack Kevorkian"
Go back and forth in, more beef than you can pack a fork in
I'm livin the life of the infinite enemy down, my tenement chimney now
The semi's the remedy pow, spin him around, enterin in the vicinity

[Eminem]
Now - he's called Eminem but he threw away the candy and ate the rapper
Chewed him up {*ptu*} and spitted him out; girl giddy up and now get-get down
He's lookin around this club and it looks like people are havin a shit fit now
Yeah little tr-tr-trailer trash, take a look who's back in t-t-town
Did I st-st-stutter motherfucker? Fuck the mall
He shuts the whole motherfuckin Walmart d-d-down every time he comes a-r-r-round
And he came to the club tonight with 5'9" to hold this bitch down
Like a motherfuckin chick underwater he's tryin to dr-dr-drown
Shorty when you dance you got me captivated 
Just by the way that you keep lickin them dick suckin lips, I'm agitated
Aggravated to the point you don't suck my DICK then you're gonna get decapitated
Other words you don't fuckin give me head then I'ma have to take it!

[Royce Da 5'9"]
And then after takin that I'ma catch a case, it's gon' be fascinatin
It's gon' say the whole rap game passed away on top of the affidavit
Graduated from master debater slash massive masturbator
to Michael Jackson's activator (woo!)
Meanin I'm on fire off the top, might wanna back up the data
Rollin over hip-hop in a verbal tractor trailer
Homie they sick, you could normally ask a hater
Don't it make sense that these shell cases is just like a bag of paper 
dropped in the lap of a tax evader - homie they spent

[Eminem]
Now make that ass DROP like a sack of potatoes, what girl I'm the crackalator
Percolator of this party, be my penis ejaculator later
Tell ya boyfriend that you just struck paydirt
You're rollin with a player, you won't be exaggeratin when you say you're livin

[Chorus]

[Outro: Sly Jordan]
Pedal to the metal
Pedal to the metal {*echoes*}
