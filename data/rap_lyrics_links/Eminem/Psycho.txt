[Intro: 50 Cent]
I can hear your heartbeat you're scared yeah
yeah I hear feel your heartbeat, you're scared
I can hear your heartbeat you're scared yeah
yeah I hear feel your heartbeat, you're scared

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Eminem]
You see I'm a psycho (Psycho) A sicko (A sicko) I'm crazy (I'm crazy)
I said I got my knife boy (Knife boy)
I'll kill you (I'll kill you) If you make me (If you make me)
They wanna see my shot up (Shot up)
Locked up (Locked up) Then cage me (Then cage me)
I come back bigger (Bigger) Stronger
(Stronger) And angry (And angry)

[Verse One: 50 Cent]
Yeah! Look look I come from a different crew you fuck with me I'll get to you
A clip or two I'll cripple you just cause I ain't got shit to do
Pistol pop a pussy drop, drama never ever stop
Eenie meenie mini moe, Nine, Trey pound or Forty fo'
Pick a strap then take the Mac the Hawk I stab it in your back
I'll blow your brains I know your name and where you rest I make a mess
The hollow tips will hit your chest you cough up blood till EMS
Come pick you up you know your fucked when you get on the stretcher
Cause I come into ICU to see you off to Heaven
The system I done been through it there's nothin new done to me
They lock me up they let me out you seen this in the movies
The criminals be criminals while they up in corrections
They come home get a Nine then commit crime in perfection
It's murder one they found a gun now they doin ballistics
But they can't find a fingerprint the shit's goin terrific
Get so close on your target that it's really hard to miss it 

[Chorus]

[Verse Two: Eminem]
Man these are average raps, I'm keepin the savage batch hidden
The can of whoop ass with the Shady/Aftermath clique
You pop off the top, it's like openin vats of acid
Beat the Octomom to death with Cabbage Patch Kid
Attack a snatch yeah there's somethin to jack a batch in
Impregnated then chewed up the embryo sack with Mac-10s'
Triplets, quadruplets, and a couple of back-to-back twins
That fetus is fallin out all over, Jack is back again
The Ripper's at your service, girl I can see that you're nervous
But I barely scratch the surface, llke my last batch of girlfriends
That I buried in my fuckin backyard, still tryin to dig their way out
I foam like an attack dog, how late you wanna stay out?
It's past your curfew when it's dark, I'm searchin for you in the park
Shady murdered him another virgin, he just hit his mark
He met his quota for the month, they found Dakota all rolled up
Inside a bag, he probably dragged the body for about a block
Disappeared without a trace, no DNA, no not a drop
'Cause me and Dre and 50 we will never get caught by the cops
CSI, they hate us but they gotta give a lot of props
The drama pops, grab the butcher knife from off the counter tops

[Chorus: 50 Cent]

[Verse Three: Eminem]
Yeah, I'm as ill as can be
My appeal is to serial killers what a pill is to me
Killin' so villainously
Still as maniacal on the night goin psycho as Michael Myers 
You know what we're like on the muthafuckin mic, so try us 
and you're gonna find out what the fuck we're like with pliers

[Verse Four: 50 Cent]
It's operation time they got him hooked up the wires
Squeezin me bleedin wheezin breathin he half dead
He must ain't know but now he know how Shady the Math is
Even murderous tactics get better with practice
Led showers, gun powder, feel the talons burn burn!!!
School of arts, truly y'all, you better learn learn!!!

[Verse Five: Eminem]
Chris Reeves in his grave, yeah homie, turn turn
I'm debatin, mutilatin the lady
You've been waitin for Shady and Fif, ain't no duplicatin it, baby
There's a baby in the dryer, there's a torso in the washer
I think it might even belong to Portia when I tossed her
Arms and legs in the garbage, 'cause the rest of her, I lost her
Her head is in the disposal with Jessica's I squashed her
I put her on the ringer and hung her over the wash tub

[Verse Six: 50 Cent]
When I'm through with Ricky It'll be blood that he'll cough up
The hard rock I'll soft up get caught up and get washed up
In Detroit or Norfolk witness this shit end up nautious
Look deep in my eye see many many men die
I swing gemstars faster than Samurai

[Chorus]
