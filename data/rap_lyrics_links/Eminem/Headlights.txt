[Nate Ruess]
Mom, I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off, and I'm fucked up?
And mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
as you pour yourself, another drink, yeah

[Chorus: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shinin in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too farrrrrr

[Eminem]
I went in head-first, never thinkin about who what I said hurt
in what verse, my mom probably got it the worst
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are, did I take it too far?
"Cleaning Out My Closet" and all them other songs, but regardless I don't hate you cause ma!
You're still beautiful to me, cause you're my mom
Though far be it from you to be calm, our house was Vietnam
Desert Storm, and both of us put together could form an atomic bomb
equivalent to chemical warfare, and forever we can drag this on and on
But, agree to disagree, that gift for me up under the Christmas tree
don't mean shit to me, you're kickin me out? It's 15 degrees
and it's Christmas Eve, "Little prick just leave!" Ma, let me grab my fuckin coat
Anything to have each other's goats, why we always at each other's throats?
Especially when dad he fucked us both, we're in the same fuckin boat
You'd think that it'd make us close (nope) further away it drove
us, but together headlights shine and car full of belongings, still got a ways to go
back to grandma's house, it's straight up the road
And I was the man of the house, the oldest so my shoulders carried the weight of the load
Then Nate got taken away by the state at 8 years old
And, that's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changeable
And to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though - but

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though
Cause you ain't even get to witness your grand-babies grow
But I'm sorry momma for "Cleaning Out My Closet," at the time I was angry, rightfully maybe so
Never meant that far to take it though
Cause, now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not makin jokes
That song I'll no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio
And I think of Nathan bein placed in a home
and all the medicine you fed us and, how I just wanted you to taste your own
But, now the medication's taken over, and your mental state's deterioratin slow
And I'm way too old to cry, the shit is painful though
But ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan yo
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us BOTH
Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours
But I love you Debbie Mathers, oh what a tangled web we have cause
One thing I never asked was, where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keepin up with every address
But I'da flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus
Owned a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
Someone ever moved them from ME? That you coulda bet your asses
if I had to come down the chim-i-ney dressed as Santa
Kidnap 'em, and although one has only met their grandma
once, you pulled up in our drive one night as we were leavin to get some hamburgers
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you
and as you left I had this, overwhelmin sadness
come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths and
I saw your headlights as I looked back and I'm mad I didn't get the chance to
thank you for bein my mom and my dad so
Mom please accept this as a tribute, I wrote this on the jet, I guess I had to
get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to lay it 'fore I'm dead, the stewardess said to fasten
my seatbelt, I guess we're crashin
So if I'm not dreamin, I hope you get this message that I
will always love you from afar - cause you're my ma

[Chorus]

[Nate Ruess] + (Eminem)
I want a new life (start over) one without a cause (clean slate)
So I'm comin home tonight (yeah) well no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down, or if the crew can't wake me up
Well just know that I'm alright; I was not afraid to die
Oh even if there's songs to sing, well my children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright; I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my lil' girls so I'll never say, goodbye cruel world
Just know that I'm alright; I am not afraid to diiiiiiie

[Chorus]

[Nate Ruess]
I want a new life
