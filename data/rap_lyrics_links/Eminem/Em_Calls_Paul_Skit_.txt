[Eminem - talking through an electrolarynx]
'Ey yo Paul
It's Em
I got your call about the Michael Jackson thing
And I know that he's not "Thrilled" about the video
What does he "Wanna be Startin' Somethin"?
Er-wow
Well I'll show him who's really "Bad" {* burps *}
Paul, "The Way You Make Me Feel" with these calls
You should really take a look at the "Man In The Mirror" 
And tell him to "Beat it" because I "Won't stop 'til I get enough"
Do you "Remember The Time" we were watching the "Billy Jean" video?
Well he'll always be that Michael to me
And it doesn't matter if he's "Black or White"
Because I "Can't Stop Loving" him and I hate plastic surgeons
And I hope they all fucking diiiiiiie!
How do you like that?
And I like him, I like him a lot
I want to touch him but I can't
{* Unintelligable compuerised speech with faint human straining noises *}
Excuse me, I'm taking a shit
Sorry
Anyways, call me back
I have this idea about how I want to end the show
So, hit me when you get this message fucker
Oh, and by the way
No I don't have a new gun 
{* Gun clicks *}

[Faint human voice]
Goddamn it!
