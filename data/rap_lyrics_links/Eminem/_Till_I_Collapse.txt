Artist: Eminem f/ Nate Dogg
Album:  The Eminem Show
Song:   'Till I Collapse
Typed by: OHHLA Webmaster DJ Flash *

* It is the personal opinion of the webmaster that the chorus of this song
  as it appears on Eminem's website and in his liner notes is just plain WRONG!

[Intro]
Sometimes you just feel tired, feel weak
And when you feel weak, you feel like you wanna just give up
But you gotta search within you, try to find that inner strength
and just pull that shit out of you
And get that motivation to not give up, and not be a quitter
No matter how bad you wanna just fall flat on your face, and collapse

[Eminem]
Till I collapse I'm spillin these raps long as you feel 'em
Till the day that I drop you'll never say that I'm not killin 'em
Cause when I am not, then I'ma stop pinnin 'em
and I am not hip-hop and I'm just not Eminem
Subliminal thoughts, when I'ma stop sendin 'em
Women are caught in webs, spin 'em and hoch venom
Adrenalin shots of penicillin could not get the illin to stop
Amoxacillin's just not real enough
The criminal cop killin hip-hop villain
A minimal swap to cop millions of 'Pac listeners
You're comin with me, feel it or not you're gonna fear it
like I showed ya the spirit of God lives in us
You hear it a lot, lyrics to shock
Is it a miracle or am I just product of pop fizzin up?
Fo' shizzle my wizzle, this is the plot, listen up
You bizzles forgot, Slizzel does not give a fuck

[Chorus 2X: Nate Dogg]
Till the roof comes off, till the lights go out
Till my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
Till the smoke clears out - am I high? Perhaps
I'ma rip this shit, till my bones collapse

[Eminem]
Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin you get
when you real and you spit an' people are feelin your shit
This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
tryin to hold on to it cause you may never get it again
So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
And when your run is over just admit when it's at its end
Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit gets in
I got a list here's the order of my list that it's in
It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, Tupac and Biggie
Andre from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas and then me
But in this industry I'm the cause of a LOT of envy
So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does NOT offend me
That's why you see me walkin around like nothin's botherin me
Even though half you people got a fuckin problem with me
You hate it but you know respect you got to give me
The press's wet dream like Bobby and Whitney, Nate hit me

[Chorus]

[Eminem]
Soon as the verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
What is he thinkin? How not to go against me, smart!
And it's absurd, how people hang on ev-ery word
I'll probably NEVER get the props I feel I ever deserve
But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin could ever be worse
That's why I'm clever when I put together ev-ery verse
My thoughts, are sporadic, I act, like I'm a addict
I rap, like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
So this is like a full blown attack I'm launchin at 'em
The track is on some battlin raps who want some static?
Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
A plaque and platinum status is WACK if I'm not the baddest, so

[Chorus]

[Eminem] Until the roof
[N.Dogg] Until the roof
[Eminem] The roof comes off
[N.Dogg] The roof comes off
[Eminem] Until my legs
[N.Dogg] Until my legs
[Em + N] Give out from under me

[Eminem] I will not fall, I will stand tall
[Eminem] Feels like no one can beat me
