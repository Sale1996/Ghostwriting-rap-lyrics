[Eminem] Daddy?

[Chorus: children singing - repeat 2X]
I wanna be just like you
When I grow up, just like you
I wanna be just like you
When I grow up, just like you

[Bizarre]
You don't wanna be just like your daddy
Pimpin hoes, out here drivin Caddy's
Runnin around town, fuckin with skeezers
Shots in your ass, catchin diseases
Son - your daddy got a foul mouth
For fuckin - bitches in they foul mouth
I can't help it, my group's D12
All we do is pop pills and stay in jail
Talkin nasty shit, Bizarre won't stop
I fuck two twins, with a midget on top (yeah!)
A sick mind, rapin an old lady
Knowin damn well Bizarre shouldn't have a baby
All I can teach you, learn how to mack
Smoke crack, smack a bitch when she talk back (bitch!)
Matter of fact, smack your sister she's a slut
Don't you realize, Bizarre don't give a fuck?  HAHAHA!

[Chorus]

[Bizarre]
Don't go to school, become a Catholic priest
Sell crack to your Auntie Denice
If Auntie Denice is short forty cent
Make her get on the ground and {fuck} a small {*edited*}
Nas is gon' probably hate me
When Mos Def hear this, he probably gon' suffocate me
"Why they let Bizarre rap on Hi-Tek track?
 All he gon' do is talk about hoes and smokin crack"
If your wife is pregnant, I call a whore
Leave her no money, and go out on tour
Nahh, hah, I'm playin - leave her somethin
A pack of hot dogs and a fuckin dirty muffin (damn!)
You're my son, I'm tryin to teach you somethin
You're {*edited*} years old, it's time to start fuckin
You know daddy won't give you no wrong advice
Smoke weed, then listen to Obie Trice

[Chorus]

[Bizarre] HAHAHA!

[Chorus]

[Bizarre]
All I can tell you how to do is pop pills and stay high
.. and tell a bitch to suck a dick, AH-HAH!
I'm a pimp, playah!
A motherfuckin role model
Hi-Tek
