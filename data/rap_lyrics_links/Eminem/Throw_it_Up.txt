[Intro: Yelawolf]
Ay Boo, get these motherfuckers
And pass that Jack

[Chorus: Gangsta Boo]
I see you bitches talkin loud but you ain't sayin shit
Get the fuck from 'round hurr, you don't rep my shit
Y'ain't from my city, you don't know about this
You don't want that drama, y'ain't ready for it bitch
Now throw it up (yeah hoe) throw it up
Throw it up (yeah hoe) y'ain't ready for it bitch
Throw it up (yeah hoe) throw it up
Throw it up (yeah) y'ain't ready for it bitch

[Yelawolf]
Hahahaha, yeah Gangsta Boo
Let me holler at 'em

I already got, two cars in a yard that don't run
So why would I wanna break shit down for you? Better be confused with the punch-
-lines and bars that I launch, here the king of archery come
with a cracker dick, to fuck you and that pussy carpet you munch
If I'm not hardly the one, you must be barely the one
Billy if really you're kiddin, bitch I'm the prodigal son
And I'm stuntin like my daddy, dr-dr-dr-dr-drinkin like my momma
C-c-country like my uncle, stutterin like a CD in a donk go BUMP-BUMP-BUMP-BUMP
And I'm in a blue Chevy, runnin over motherfuckers in first
I ain't even shift gears yet, I ain't even here yet, I'm outta this Earth
Right? (Yeah hoe) But I just hit the surface
And I'm about to walk into a bank with a shank and a black can of paint and check the clerk
(Where the keys?) Bitch you better check your purse, I got a brick of herb
And I hit the syrup, and I'm feelin like I might just hit the curb
So get the fuck out of my way buddy, you don't wanna walk around the chicken house 
with a hawk little puppy dog, Yelawolf and Eminem, shit
Sufferin succotash, yeah suck a dick bitch!

[Chorus]

[Gangsta Boo]
Bitch please, you don't wanna step up to this Mrs.
G-A-N-G-S-T-A Boo make a nigga hit his knees when
I'm up in the building, preachin to my children
I don't be takin no shit from you haters, you'll make me hurt one of your feelings
Hahahahaha; naa-naa-nee-naa-naa
Pick yo' face up off the flo', I got you feelin sad now
You be on that hokey-wag, hokey-wag is bullshit
Run into this Gangsta have yo' preacher at the pulpit
Bitch, I was born on the Mississippi River (yeah hoe, yeah hoe)
Take no shit, from a bitch, or a nigga (yeah hoe, yeah hoe)
So so crazy, got a fucked up temper (yeah hoe, yeah hoe)
Bi-polar, not Nicki, I'm worser, I'll hurt ya (yeah hoe, yeah hoe)
Ha ha, I got a crazy ass mind game
My nigga, I'm a lion, untamed
Hunt ya ass down in my jungle, I do this
I'll tell 'em hoes - y'ain't ready for it bitch!

[Chorus]

[Gangsta Boo]
I see you bitches talkin loud but you ain't say...

[Eminem]
Me and, Yela-wolf, tear the, roof, off this motherfucker
You ain't got the oomph, you're a hoof, to the foot of an elephant
Hello toots, you look so eloquent, that's what I tell a cunt
Come sit up front cause you're kickin my seat and I'm tryin to tell the cashier what I want
They say I act like an asshole, when I pull up at the White Castle
and I ask for an appli-cation, throw it back in their face and tell the bitch I'm a rapper
Then I whack her in the head with a Whopper that I bought from BK, you expect me to be proper?
Bitch you better pop in a CD of me immediately slut hoe! Skeedideedada
Prada? Not a, chance, I was thinkin about buying you some clothes 
but Target was closed so I decided to mosey on over to K-Mart but the do's
was locked, what about some shoes I thought, great I suppose
So I go to Payless but what d'ya know, they didn't carry a size 8 in HOES~!
OHH! This is, ugly, boy, swag
Putting, toe, tags, on you, mother-fuckin, hoe, bags
What a, trailer, trash, pioneer, I am yeah, that's why I'm here
I don't got a rhyme book, it's more like a motherfuckin diary of, DIARRHEA!
Me, Yelawolf and Gangsta Boo came here to show you a thang or two
about sign language, middle fingers aimed at you so we don't gotta SCREAM AT YOU~!
OWW! I just bit my bottom lip, it was an accident
I went to go tell 'em all to go get FUCKED!
But I'm never gonna bite my tongue, little bitch throw it up

[Gangsta Boo]
I see you bitches talkin loud but you ain't say...
