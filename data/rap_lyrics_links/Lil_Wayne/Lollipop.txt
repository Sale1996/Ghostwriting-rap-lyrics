[Intro: Lil Wayne] + [Static Major]
Uh huh, No homo, Young Moolah baby
I said he so sweet, make her wanna lick the rapper
So I let her lick the rapper
[She lick me like a lollipop - 4X]

[Chorus 2X: Static Major]
Shawty want a thug
Bottles in the club
Shawty wanna hump
You know I love to touch her lovely lady lumps

[Lil Wayne]
Okay, lil mama had a swag like mine
She even wear her hair down her back like mine
I make her feel right when it's wrong like lying
Man, she ain't never had a move like mine
But man, I ain't never seen an ass like hers
That pussy in my mouth had me lost for words
So I told her to back it up like burp, burp
And made that ass jump like jerp, jerp
And that's when she

[Pre-Chorus: Static Major]
She lick me like a lollipop - 4X

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
Now after you back it up and stop
Drop it shawty, drop it like its hot
Ooh, drop it like its hot
Do it shawty, don't stop
Shawty say the nigga that she wit ain't shit
Shawty say the nigga that she wit ain't this
Shawty say the nigga that she wit can't hit
But shawty, I'ma hit it hit it like I can't miss
And he can't do this, and he don't do that
Shawty need a refund, need to bring that nigga back
Just like a refund, I make her bring that ass back
And she bring that ass back cause I like that

And when I'm at the bottom, she Hillary Rodham
The middle of the bed, I'm givin, getting head
