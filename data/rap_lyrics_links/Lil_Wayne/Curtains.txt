[Lil Wayne]
I ain't nervous, hehe
I swear to God I ain't nervous, nawww, nah
And I'm laughin at them pussy niggaz and that pussy shit they doin
I'm gettin cake like I'm Jewish, my nigga Drake he Jewish
I swear to God I ain't nervous, naww, he he
Okay I swear to god I ain't nervous
I swear to God I ain't nervous
I said I swear to god I ain't nervous
I got her workin twerkin and slurpin - my sepernt
Ain't got no problems in this bitch, for certain
I see you turnin up but yo' turn up ain't workin
Just want some bottle and lip service
And I got all my niggaz in that truck like an Excursion

Ok I'm straight action - no ricochet
That pussy boneless - that's Chick-Fil-A
I fuck with real riders, and they tickets paid
For them dead presidents, we will start diggin graves
I swear my momma trust my work, so I give these hoes that work
They say the best things in life are free
That's why it cost for you to get get murked
And my pants saggin like fuck it, I'm still on my business
Spent my birthday in jail, I was makin bad decisions
Saw my enemy at the light, shot him up before it turned green
Man my niggaz got them birds, you ain't even got birdseed
Yo' bitch ride me like a go kart
I play that pussy like Mozart
I Mozart these hoes hearts then after that they worthless

[Chorusk 1: Lil Wayne]
Man, I swear to God I ain't nervous
I said I swear to God I ain't nervous
I don't know, I swear to God I ain't nervous
And that pussy don't get purchased - hoe
Ain't got no problems in this bitch, for certain
I see you turnin up but yo' turn up ain't workin
I like 'em long hair and curvy
And if niggaz think it's a game, I'll leave they brains on they jerseys

[Lil Wayne]
She say she love me, that's the molly talkin
She 'bout to blow me, like a signing bonus
She got a nigga, but he ain't me bitch
I'm an original gangster he the remix
Girl do you use that same mouth to kiss yo' momma?
I say, only God can judge me, fuck your honor
Yeah, and, her birthday suit is her pajamas
She say "I didn't know your dick was a recliner"
I'll punch your man in his eye, give him a shiner
I'll blind him, him and whoever co-sign him, I get Adam like Yolonda
Youn Money Cash Money's Obama, it's fuck the world, no condom
If he twisted I'll unwind him, and this pistol came with a silence

[Chorus 2: Lil Wayne]
But I swear to God he heard it!
Yea, and I swear to God I ain't nervous, naww
I swear to God I ain't nervous, uh-uh
Bitch I'm the God, I should be rappin in a turban
Ain't got no problems in this bitch and that's for certain
I see you turnin up but yo' turn up ain't workin (yeah)
Baby, I just want some bottle and lip service
She gon' ride this dick like the Kentucky, Derby

[Boo]
On that Pat-ron, I'm swervin, game tight like virgins
Got a bad bitch, she Persian, call her AK when she's squirtin
You see the niggaz I'm with, that boy Boo the shit
As lonh as I got a face, yo' bitch got a place to sit
Yeah I'm wildin off them shroomies, ain't got "No Worries" like Tunechi
All my chicks be bougie, wanna hold hands, then watch movies
I'll be God damned, make a nigga lose it, ain't no talkin, let's get to it
Real niggaz winnin, fake niggaz losing bitch I'll leave that pussy with bruises

[Lil Wayne]
Girl, I swear to God I ain't nervous, uh-uh
I swear to God I ain't nervous
Now hoe you know I swear to God I ain't nervous
I got her workin, twerkin and slurpin - my serpent
Ain't got no problems in this bitch and that's for certain
You fuck with Tunechi, you end up a missin person
She got Lil Tunechi on her booty, in cursive
I'm gettin head behind the Maybach - curtains
Yeah~!
