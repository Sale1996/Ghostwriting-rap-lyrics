[Intro]
Me know say life nice
As bad as him be
Me know say him nuh wah dead
Den, Jesus Christ
Tell me why society try stop
Ghetto yute corn bread
Dats not nice
Cah dem know youth a go rise up
And buss coppa and lead
And end up wanted

[Chorus]
And I'm grindin until I'm tired
Cause they said you ain't grindin until you tired
So I'm grindin with my eyes wide, lookin to find
A way through the day, a life for the night
Dear Lord you done took so many of my people
I'm just wonderin why you haven't taken my life (my life, my life)
Like what the hell am I doin right? (Me kno seh life nice)
(Weh dem call police fah)

[Verse 1]
Hey russian!
Ghetto youths have it harda
Nuff a we nuh grow with no fadda (no fadda)
So we end up tun gangsta
Nuff a dem sell out and a move like chebadda
Then nuff time mi get up and mi nah hav a dime
Pocket empty but a bare shot inna mi nine
Dem new radio car cyann stop no crime
Mi a talk from mi heart dem a waste time
Dem nuh wah ghetto youth fi hav nuh things
So when you see blood a run like drinks
Do nuh call no police just call di brinks
Cause a money ghetto youth waan

[Hook]
Na na na na na na

[Chorus]
And I'm grindin until I'm tired
Cause they said you ain't grindin until you tired
So I'm grindin with my eyes wide, lookin to find
A way through the day, a life for the night
Dear Lord you done took so many of my people
I'm just wonderin why you haven't taken my life (my life, my life)
Like what the hell am I doin right?

[Verse 2]
Mi neva have nobody fi stretch mi hands to
Neva have no rich uncle fi seh thanks to
Then feds a lock up man fi sell weed
Yuh honor tell me wa you waan Lance do
Nuff time mi a pree seh guy fi die
Cah when mi look inna mi pickney eye
Shawty seh food fi buy a cry mi cry
Me bankbook empty mi pocket dry
Nuff yute nuh live fi pass grade nine
If a nuh gun man a 1-1-9
And mi God and mi gun protect mi life
Mi nah gi it weh so easy

[Hook]
Na na na na na na

[Outro]
Me know say life nice
As bad as him be
Me know say him nuh wah dead
Den, Jesus Christ
Tell me why society try stop
Ghetto yute corn bread
Dats not nice
Cah dem know youth a go rise up
And buss coppa and lead
And end up wanted
But Memba..

Na na na na na na
