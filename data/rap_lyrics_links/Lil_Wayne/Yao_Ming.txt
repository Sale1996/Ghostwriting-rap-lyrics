[David Banner]
Hello it's Mr. David Banner, yo' bitch beater
I suggest that you don't kiss or hug her, and don't eat her
I Run DMC's in this bitch in my Adidas
I was chosen to expose who you chose as a leader
Yes I'm fresh like a rose picked from the garden of Eden
I stepped out the Rolls, my game rose like Easter
I got a couple bitches that's painted like Mona Lisa
I fuck 'em at my leisure and I never touch my visa
So ghetto, my kicks so retro
Hot nuts like a rhino, call them Mark Ecko
You know I ain't braggin, I'm just sayin
I know y'all said it too, cause y'all niggaz playin
Bitch

[Chorus: David Banner]
And bitch I'm tall as Yao Ming
And bitch I'm tall as Yao Ming
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Yao Ming
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy

[2 Chainz]
Lets make a toast to the bread winner
I am so damn hot on the scale winter
Life a beach, I done dance with her
All up in the sand with her
Try to get up in the bed with her
And put my third leg in her
Uh, I've been pumpin pussy like gas nigga
Got my fo'fo', you'll get eight like math nigga
Still use a shoe box for my stash nigga
Money so tall you gon need a drug rap with ya
Yeah, self esteem high like 26
You can catch me gettin high with like twenty bitches
Takin plenty pictures, yeah you know I'm camera ready
I'm about to wax that ass, I got my candle ready

[Chorus: David Banner]
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
And bitch I'm tall as Yao Ming
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
And bitch I'm tall as Yao Ming
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Yao Ming
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy

[Lil Wayne]
Okay, traffic on Mars, smokin in a spaceship
Bright red flag stickin out like fake lips
I'm forever young, forever Young Moolah
Bitch Cash Money is an army, OOH-RAH
Tunechi be what they call me, I'm everything but sorry
Get a bad-ass high yellow bitch
to come and ride my horse, I named it Charlie
No cream in my coffee, don't bleed on my carpet
I falls in love with all these hoes
But it's money over bitches regardless
I'm so high I won't come down, boy my pack be dumb loud
Waiting for one of these niggaz to cross the line, like a touchdown
I gotchu, I'm Piru, bitch I'm out there by you
Blade on the AK, cut your ass like high school
David Banner on the beat bitch, dig it like a deep ditch
I got the world in my hands, I'm about to make a fist
Ha, I stand tall as Yao Ming
Blocka pow pow ping, must be New Orleans

[Chorus: David Banner]
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
And bitch I'm tall as Yao Ming
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
And bitch I'm tall as Yao Ming
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Yao Ming
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Look at my daddy, look at my daddy
Yao Ming
