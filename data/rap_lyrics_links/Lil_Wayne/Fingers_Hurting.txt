[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Mm, she live in Fort Lauderdale and I'm closer to South Beach
I told her to come over, she said "Okay, don't fall asleep"
She say she can be my housewife and keep my house clean
I say "Shut the fuck up, put this dick back in your mouth please"
I don't see nothin' wrong with some mouth and lip service
Tunechi in this bitch, I'm tighter than a pinched nerve bitch
I didn't answer my phone, I said "I couldn't get service"
My new Nina just told me that she sick of bein' a virgin

[Lil Wayne]
Baggin' up the work for a hour, fingers hurtin
Let my bitches help, before they leave, I check they purses
Sorry for the wait, the confusion, the disturbance
Got me movin' weight, prostitution and these verses
Whippin' in the kitchen in the trap house with my shirt off
I'ma get these millions and I put that on my first born
Got that old Juvie bumpin', talkin' bout the 3rd Ward
The D.A. was a dick and the judge was a jerk off
Got a bad bitch, body curvy like a curveball
Let her drank too much now her pussy taste like Smirnoff
Sleepin' on chinchilla boy, I'm cozy like a fur ball
Fuck the other side nigga, we could have a turf war
Sorry for the wait, had to drop this part two and shit
Just to let you know that a nigga still doin' it
Workin' like a slave on my Roots part two shit
Gotta let 'em know that Lil Tunechi still Tunechi, bitch - bop bop bop!
Fuck with me wrong, get that hammer, thank God I'm home from the slammer, was gone for the hammer
Stompin' the yard like a gamma, niggas was goin' banana, I'm calm like a camel
I'm smokin' that strong like a camel, I bet my life when we gamble
Y'all shippin' keys, we shippin' grand pianos, I'm in that Lam Diablo, pyoo like ammo
I'm gone, two fingers up bitch, I'm gone; rich forever, Jerry Jones
I gotta hustle, keepin' my destiny goin' like the House of DerÃ©on
This plane that I'm on is private, my very own so no checkin' my carry-ons
She sent a picture naked, I said "It's on"

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
But she live in Fort Lauderdale and I'm closer to South Beach
I told her to come over, she said "Okay, don't fall asleep"
She say she can be my housewife and keep my house clean
I say "Shut the fuck up, put this dick back in your mouth please"
I don't see nothin' wrong with some mouth and lip service
Tunechi motherfucker, tighter than a pinched nerve, bitch
I didn't answer my phone, I said "I couldn't get service"
My new Nina just told me that she sick of bein' a virgin

[Lil Wayne]
Now I don't get excited nigga, I just get exotic
I don't get invited to these bitches' pity parties
I don't do narcotic even though a nigga got it
Countin' all this money, I feel like I got arthritis
Baggin' up the work for a hour, fingers hurtin'
Let my bitches help me, 'fore they leave, I check their purses
Sorry for the wait, the confusion, the disturbance
Boy we movin' weight, prostitution and these verses
Whippin' in the kitchen in the trap house with my shirt off
I'm gon' get these millions and I put that on my first born
Got that old Juvie bumpin', talkin' 'bout the 3rd Ward
The D.A. was a dick and the judge was a jerk off
We yellin' "Su-woo, su-woo, su-woo..."
Yeah, you hear us yellin' "Su-woo, su-woo, su-woo"
Blood gang, nigga

And it's that "Sorry 4 the Wait 2"
Woo! And I'm so sorry for the wait too
Yeah... sorry for the wait, had to drop that part two and shit
Just to let you know that a nigga still doin' it
Workin' like a slave, talkin' Roots part two and shit
Sorry for the wait, Lil Tunechi still Tunechi bitch
