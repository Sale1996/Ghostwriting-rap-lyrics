[Lil Wayne]
Cut the music up please
Yeah, I should never leave hip-hop
Controlled by my two hands, they go tic-toc
Around the clock yes it's my time, my throne
Bet I know the time of day in any fuckin time zone
I'm feeling like I'm on top of the rhinestone
Pull in the ladder from heaven about to climb home
Mental thoughts are sharper than a pine cone
In this world of numbers I keep my nine on
And I don't go to church because the line long
And the preacher he be gettin his shine on
But I know my Lord, I am God's own
Back to my hands, tick tick, a time bomb

[Jay Sean - Chorus]
Yeahhh don't you know I'll be (I'll be) {*3X*}
I'll be here cause I won't quit, yeah
You can try to lock me up; you can try to break me down
But I stay strong, it's my throne
Can't stop now cause that ain't me
You can try to lock me up; you can try to break me down
But I stay strong, it's my throne
Can't stop now cause that ain't me

[Lil Wayne]
Try to stay afloat on my innertube
When they turned my city into a swimmin pool
Before that, it was a livin cesspool
We got get on our shit like nats do
Polices be on my tip like hats do
But, I just stay strong like blacks do
Never +Saved by the Bell+ in a black school
And I stay in trouble like +Zack+ do
And in this game, nobody's on my plateau
Therefore my name remains like a tattoo
Yes, I take giant steps in Shaq boots
B-I-R-Dman Jun-ior
Or Weezy, F, baby, baby

[Chorus]

[Jay Sean]
That ain't me - see I won't stop
That ain't me - ooh no I won't quit
That ain't me - no I won't stop
That ain't me, cause that ain't me

[Lil Wayne]
Yeah, alright, alright
Alright alright I'm in their conversations
The title's up for grab I'm into confiscation
Punched, shot, or stabbed, now you're the doctor's patient
Wild like an Arab from the Islamic nation
I get money 'round the clock, ain't got no time for hatin
And these niggaz ain't shit like they constipated
I get the coupe with the kit, watch me lobster red it
Drop the top at the light that's when I behead it
So far ahead of them, I feel outdated
But I feel electric, like I'm Raiden
Used to play Mortal Kombat when I was a couch potato
And now I'm comin out with faders, no homo {*laughing}

[Chorus]

[Jay Sean]
That ain't me - you see I won't stop
That ain't me - ooh no I can't stop
That ain't me - cause I won't quit
No I won't quit - that ain't me - no that ain't me
