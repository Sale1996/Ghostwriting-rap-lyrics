(Intro, Usher and [Beyonce]
Yeah (Yeah)
[Yeah]
[Usherrr]
Yeah this it right here
Queen Bee, yeah
I'm the king, y'all know that
She the queen, came right back
Listen to me yeaaahh, yeaah
OHH! Remix!

(Verse 1, Usher)
Now baby girl there ain't nothin more that I can say
You know by now, I want it more than anythang
If I walk away and just let you leave
You'll be stuck in my head like a melody

(Beyonce & [Usher])
I know you want it [Yeah]
But, I'm hesitating [Why?]
You must be crazy
I got a man, you got a lady

(Usher)
I know, we here together
So this must be something special
Cause, you could be anywhere you wanted
But you decided to be here with me
No coincidence, it was meant to be
Don't be shy, come let'cha boy get in
So you can tell all of your friends
He was on the remix, liiike

(Hook, Usher)
In this club
In this club
Ladies can I put this love up on you one time
If you ain't scared, say wassuuuuup
In this club
In this club
They can keep watchin
I ain't stoppin
Baby I don't give up
In this club
In this club
Ladies can I put this love up on you one time
If you ain't scared, say wassuuuuup
In this club
In this club
They can keep watchin
Baby I don't give up
In this club

(Verse 2, Beyonce & [Usher])
Baby, you know I'd be down
But we can't have all these people starin, standin around
This right here is only for your eyes to see
But you gettin carried away
Sayin we can do it where-ever
The way you touchin me [Eyy]
I know what a [I'ma make you feel insane]
Trying your hardest to make me give in
But I'ma be down to give you what'chu want if you keep it uuupp
I strongly doubt this velvet rope would hold me up
And I don't want security rollin up on us
I'm not hesitatin, I just don't wanna rush
You could be anywhere you wanted
But'chu decided to be here with me
No coincidence, it was meant to be
I guess if I mess around and let'chu get in
You gon' tell all of your friends
You was on this remix, liiiike

(Hook, Beyonce)

(Verse 3, Lil Wayne)
Ah-em...
Shawty want a thug
It started with a hug
And her ass one night
This, I gave her neck a kissy-kiss
She gave my neck a kiss back
I said we could do it like a stack
I mean we could do it like a g
On the couch in V.I.P.
Shawty we could get it on
I'm like, shot-out to the DJ for playin this song
Girl we could act like two damn fools
And everybody think we doin a dance move
Call me, so that I can get'chu to fly and meet me in the bathroom
And you could be my secret lovey-dove
Hahaha
And it started with a hug
But now we makin love in this club
And when I come stylin just because
The people in the crowd are watchin us
But we don't give a damn what they say
They said "Da-da remix bay-bay!"

(Usher)
Come a little closer to daddy, put it on ya
Need you to know, what happens here stays here

(Beyonce)
And I'm ready and willing
Almost got to go
Got'cha standin at attention
Keep it on the low

(Usher)
Ain't nobody watchin
Don't worry they can't see us
I know I got'cha hot
Now let mee innn

(Beyonce)
You in the club or the car
Where-ever you are
Run and tell the DJ
Run it back on re-play

(Hook, Usher & Beyonce)

(Outro, Usher & Beyonce)
Now run and tell all of your friends
You gotta get this remix, liiike

(Usher)
King and Queen
Y'all know
Yeah man
