You know, it's just some real nigga shit, your real nigga story
You know what I'm saying?

Slang a bunch of narcotics
Pull up in that new Rrari
Living like John Gotti
Chopping bricks like karate
Drink a bunch of codeine
Serving to the dope fiends
Blowing money, stay clean
Michael Jackson, Billy Jean

Got a Panamera on a young nigga here
Got a young bitch pulling up in a van
Smoke a lot of kush and I have a lot of sex
Had to beat the grind up, ran up my check
Bitch, a nigga get money, nigga get that
Hold up, brother run it, nigga sell up all the crack
You can hear that nigga lying, hold up, what you want?
I get bubble Maserati with the duffer, don't wanna look
50 thousand on your watch, damn nigga splurge
Hold up ace of spade, 'bout to sip a coup of syrup
Keep a young nigga working at a buzz a K
I'mma take a phone call, busting every pay

Slang a bunch of narcotics
Pull up in that new rrari
Living like John Gotti
Chopping bricks like karate
Drink a bunch of codeine
Serving to the dope fiends
Blowing money, stay clean
Michael Jackson, Billy Jean

I lift off, Lamborghini lip gloss
Tropicana diamond cuffs cool my wrist off
The wheels cold icy cuffs with the glossy chain
The frosted flake tony tiger tangerine rain

Gotta couple flips couple tricks under sleeve
I can sneeze I can change the breeze to winter season
Balling for no reason balling for the people
I flew across Brazil with the bald eagle

Here's the sequel: all back on the Buick Regal
Both door handle sanded with the desert eagle
Jody drankin sake bombs in the Kawasaki
Awww shit look who it is: the white Mr. Miyagi

Ice upon my chest they figured I played hockey (wayne gretsky)
The way I drive the box Porsche, figured I was kin to rocky

Slang a bunch of narcotics
Pull up in that new rrari
Living like John Gotti
Chopping bricks like karate
Drink a bunch of codeine
Serving to the dope fiends
Blowing money, stay clean
Michael Jackson, Billy Jean

Who bad? Pop a lot of pain pill
Bout to put rims on my skateboard wheel
Beat that pussy up like Emmitt Till
Two cellphone ringing at the same time
That's your hoe calling from two different phones
Tell that bitch leave me the fuck alone
See you fuck her wrong and I fuck her long

I got a love/hate relationship with molly
I rather pop an olly and my dick is a trolley
Boy I bury you like holly
They say I'm blind 'cause I don't see nothing wrong
With a little bump and grind
and I just received a package them other niggas taxing 
and my pocket so fat I start to feel contractions
And my cousin went to jail for them chickens
And he already home, man, that nigga must be snitching
Cut him off like karate

Slang a bunch of narcotics
Pull up in that new rrari
Living like John Gotti
Chopping bricks like karate
Drink a bunch of codeine
Serving to the dope fiends
Blowing money stay clean
Michael Jackson Billy Jean
