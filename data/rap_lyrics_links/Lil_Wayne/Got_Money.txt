[Intro: Lil Wayne]
I need Winn-Dixie grocery bag full of money right now to the VIP section
(Yea, young, young, young, young, young)
 
[Chorus: T-Pain]
Got money (yeah), and you know it (yeah),
Take it out your pocket and show it, then throw like
(flyy) This-a-way (flyy), that-a-way (flyy), this-a-way (flyy), that-a-way
Getting mugged from everybody who sees it
Hang over the wall of the VIP like
(flyy) This-a-way (flyy), that-a-way (flyy), this-a-way (flyy), that-a-way
 
[Lil Wayne]
I was bouncing through the club
She love the way I diddy-bop
I see her boyfriend hatin' like a city cop
Now I ain't never been a chicken but my fitted cocked
Say I ant never been a chicken but my semi cocked
Now where your bar at
I'm trynna rent it out
And we so bout it bout it
Now what are you about
Dj showin love he say my name when the music stop
Young money, Lil Wayne then the music drop
I make it snow
I make it flurry
I make it all back tomorrow, don't worry
Yah, young wayne on the hoes
AKA Mr. Make-it-rain on the hoes
Young money
 
[Chorus: T-Pain and Lil Wayne]
Got money (yeah), and you know it (yeah)
Take it out your pocket and show it, then throw like
(flyy) This-a-way (flyy), that-a-way (flyy), this-a-way (flyy), that-a-way
Getting mugged from everybody who sees it (yeah)
Hang over the wall of the VIP like (C'mon)
(flyy) This-a-way (flyy), that-a-way (flyy), this-a-way (flyy), that-a-way
 
 
[Lil Wayne]
(We got this one Streets)
We go one for the money
Two for the show
Clap your hands if you got a bank roll (Chris)
Like some clap on lights in this bitch
Imma be clappin all night in this bitch
Lights off, mask on, creep silent, she smilin, he muggin, who cares
Cuz my goons, are right here
Like its nothing, to a big dog
And I'm a Great Dane
I wear 8 chains, I mean so much ice 
They yell skate wayne
She wanna fuck weezy 
But she wanna rape Wayne
(And I'mma let her)
 
[Chorus: T-Pain]
 
Got money (yeah), and you know it (yeah)
Take it out your pocket and show it, then throw like
(flyy) This-a-way (flyy), that-a-way (flyy), this-a-way (flyy), that-a-way
Getting mugged from everybody who sees it
Hang over the wall of the VIP like
 
[Lil Wayne]

And everybody say, Mr. rain man can we have a rainy day
Bring an umbrella, please bring an umbrella, ella, ella, ella, AAAA'
Bitch ain't shit but a hoe and a trick
But you know it ain't trickin if you got it
You know you ain't fuckin if you not thick
And I'll cool your ass down if you think your hot shit

And just like it I'll blow that shit
Cuz bitch I'm the bomb like tick, tick, BIATCH
