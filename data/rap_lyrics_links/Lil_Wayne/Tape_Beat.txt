[Hodgy]
Yeah, yeah
Born in antagonism, sometimes I can't even fathom
Hopes man, I don't even have 'em
Burning ladders, bridges
Can't wait to get to a chapter where I'm laughing and living
For what I'm stuck in a [?], indirect precision
Digging through old folders for what I feel I'm missing
This liquor, nine months ago swear I'd make better decisions
I would drink by the liter of kittens
my liver bleeds while I'm checking out instead of seeing the difference
I'm [?] at the deceased, horse leaving an imprint
While trying to beat the dead, you're just feeding existence
Sometimes you need to take a step back and breathe for a minute
Before you overreact to the heat and intenseness
You were weak and defenseless once you preceded the limit
Then it's not a scrimmage, the game's to ruin your self-seeking image
All the chaos in the day lies the region for tenants
You'll go to jail and pay bail then the judge reads you a sentence

[Lil Wayne]
Hello honey, I'm home
I'm kicking out the weak and the timid niggas
They keepin' it pimping, Weezy baby to an infant
I'm growing
You niggas snoring 'cause you sleep with the fishes
You'll be like sheep to a grizzly, put my bare feet on them bitches
And I keep a bitch with me, yellow as pee that I spit in
I'm a breeze to the finish and I'm a weep when I win it
I'm a sleep with the semi and never let people get near me
When the reaper come get me that's when I reap what I'm knitting
So, you say you're gangsta I'm a need some convincing
Blood gang, creme de la creme is the Crimson
Fuck the pigs all day, even the guineas
Fuck the system, pull out
And skeet on the titties
It's Lil Tunechi
Started from a league now we swimming
Put this hot red revolver to your cheek while you're grinning
I could cheat Roger Clemens

[Hodgy & Lil Wayne]
Catch a nigga riding deep in your women
Beep goes the Jeep so we winning
Friendless, compete with no nigga but myself
White sand and the beach towels hitting
White man let my peeps outta prison
I'm just saying what I'm saying
But I'm saying, I don't repeat I'm repentant
Cut off the hand to hand out a sentence
Ugh
