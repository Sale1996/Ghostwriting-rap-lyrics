[Intro: Lil Wayne]
I ain't nervous
I swear to God I ain't nervous
Naw, naw
And I'm laughin at them pussy niggas
And that pussy shit they doin
Gettin cake like I'm Jewish
My nigga Drake he Jewish
I swear to God I ain't nervous, naw

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Ok, I swear to God I ain't nervous
I swear to God I ain't nervous
I say I swear to God I ain't nervous
I got her workin, twerkin, and slurpin my syrupin
Ain't got no problems in this bitch for certain
I see you turning up with your turn up ain't workin
Just want some mouth and lip service, yeah
I'm gettin head behind the Maybach curtains

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Ok I'm straight edge, no ricochet
That pussy boneless, that Chick-Fil-A
I fuck with real riders, and they tickets paid
Niggas crying wolf, while I wipe them tears away
I swear my mama trust my work
So I give these hoes that work
They say the best things in life are free
So thats why it cost for you to get murked
Have my pants saggin like fuck it
I'm still on my business, spent my birthday in jail
I was making bad decisions, saw my enemy at the light
I told Marley light the weed
Then I lit them niggas up before that motherfucker turn green
Your bitch ride my like a go kart
I pay that pussy like Mozart
I Mozart these hoes hearts and then after that they worseless

[Hook]
Ok, I swear to God I ain't nervous
I swear to God I ain't nervous
I say I swear to God I ain't nervous
I got her workin, twerkin, and slurpin my syrupin
Ain't got no problems in this bitch for certain
I see you turning up with your turn up ain't workin

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I like em long hair and curvy
If niggas think its a game I leave their brains on their jerseys
She said she love me, thats the molly talkin
Her pussy so wet, it keep sliding off it
She got a nigga, but he ain't me bitch
I'm the original gangsta, he the remix
Girl do you use that same mouth to kiss your mama?
I say only God can judge me, fuck your honor
Yeah, her birthday suit is her pajamas
She said I didn't know your dick was a recliner
I punch her man in his eye give him a shiner
I blind him
Him and whoever co-signed him
I get Adam like Yolanda
Young Money Cash Money Obama
Its fuck the world no condom
If he twisted, Ill unwind him
And this pistol came with a silence
But I swear to God he heard it

[Hook]
I said I swear to god I ain't nervous
Naw, I swear to got I ain't nervous, aha
Bitch I'm a god, I should be rappin in the turban
Ain't got no problems in this bitch, for certains
I see your turning up but your turn up ain't workin
Baby I do on some out here lip service
She gonna ride this dick like the kentucky, derby

[Verse 3: Boo]
On that Pat Ryan I'm swervin
Game tight like virgins
Got a bad bitch she Persian
Call her AK when she squirtin
You see the niggas I'm with
That boy Boo the shit
As long as I got a face, your bitch got a place to sit
Yeah I'm wildin' off them shroomies
Ain't got no worries like Tunechi
All my chicks be boosie
Wanna hold hands, then watch movies
I be like God damn, make a nigga lose it
Ain't no talkin, lets get to it
Real niggas winnin, fake niggas losin
Bitch I leave that pussy with bruises

[Hook]
Girl, I swear to God I ain't nervous
I swear to God I ain't nervous
No, I swear to God I ain't nervous
I got her workin, twerkin, and slurpin my syrupin
Ain't got no problems in this bitch for certain
You fuck with tunchi, you end up a missin person
She got a tunchi on her booty
I'm getting head behind the Maybach, curtains
Yeah
