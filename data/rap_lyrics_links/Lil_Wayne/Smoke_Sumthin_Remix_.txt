[Verse 1: Curren$y]
One for the money, yes sir, two for the show
But I ain't steppin on the stage until they count up all my cash flow
Oh man, then your man's going Twilight Zone
Want to be left along, again at home, listenin' to Soulja Slim
I spread that dough out, rolling pins slice it up
With my closest friends as the grimey globe spins, I'm grinding
Trying to keep dirt off my rims and my name
Out c'here stay poppin up at the red carpet
In my green Tahoe, with my Las Vegas bitch and one of your hoes
"Hi there! " I like what she working with, that's why we hired her
We pull up on the set, tattoo calligarphy letter Jets love
And respect, we passing you the fuck up
And passing you none of my bud that's why you standing round us bruh!
Oh you accounted for, who brung you? You don't speak the code bro
You slick tone and hung you
You walking down the aisle with the same bitches we run through
I'm in the bank line, empire, I build this for us to eat
Inside is the lunch room, outside is looking wild hungry fool
Shut the door so they don't see us, light a joint or two...

[Chorus]
Got stopped in the mall the other day
I heard a call from the other way
Where I just came from, some nigga was saying som'n
Talking about smoking some'n

Stopped in the mall the other day
I heard a call from the other way
Where I just came from, some bitches was saying something
Talking about smoking something...

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Let me go light me one up for all my trouble
I'm chillin with this bitch who think we make the perfect couple
But she trippin, I'm sippin on some bubbly with no bubbles
It's me that's who? I put this shit together like puzzles
I'm puzzled: is it me or niggas is lame?
You're coward-hearted, yellow, lemon merengue
I'm about to change my name from "Dwayne" to "Deranged"
To be a billionaire I got a shot like Danny Ainge
My gang wear red, your bitch an air head
But I still break her off like a fuckin chair leg
It's Tunechi, ya heard me?
You don't deserve me. Swag so sick
So injury reserve me.
I'm the God, I should be rapping in a turban
But knowing me, I'll prolly ollie up the curb
Then grind down the rail only with my tail
Pause...

[Chorus]
Got stopped in the mall the other day
I heard a call from the other way
Where I just came from, some nigga was saying something
Talking about smoking something...

Got stopped in the mall the other day
I heard a call from the other way
Where I just came from, some bitches was saying something
Talking about smoking something...

[Lil Wayne]
Bitch, you ain't putting on
Smoke somthing?
I remember when you couldn't even smoke shit
Couldn't stay focused
But don't forget it bitch
