[Lil Wayne]
Y'all don't.. y'all don't want no problems up in here
These niggas wear dresses and y'all call me weird?
Nigga go in niggas' pockets while we here
What kind of cologne do you wear because all I could smell is fear
Nigga, y'all don't want no problems up in here
Boy I'm from New Orleans where the dope fiends kill
Nigga's brains came out his fuckin' ear
I got a full clip, I empty the whole thing up in here
Now I'm a keep a pill and a blunt
I might pass the motherfucker but most likely I'm a flunk
Tell my bitch "I could do bad on my own"
She say "You gon' miss me nigga", I say "Bitch the thrill is gone"
I ain't drove it look better in the driveway
Married to the mob, man you niggas just some bridesmaids
Bitches give me head, instead of playin' mind games
Tattooed tears for my homies, it's a cryin' shame
You could get a Dom P bottle to your face
Niggas just construction workers, tryna build a case
Males shouldn't be jealous that's a female trait
Why your bitch blowin' me up? If I answer, I deflate
Motherfucker I'm like "Y'all don't want no problems up in here"
I fuck her 'til she cry and make that hoe drink her fuckin' tears
Lord, I hope she swallow more than tears
Then her homegirl came in the room and volunteered
Man, dreads hangin' out the ski mask
Run up in your house, the couch potatoes gettin' mashed
Run up in the kitchen, get your stash out the oven
You wonder how we know? Stop talkin' while you cuddlin'
Ain't nothin' like some pussy when you goin' through somethin'
Just called a bad bitch, I said "I'm goin' through somethin'"
Bugatti sittin' still, look like it's goin' 200
Pussy nigga keep your mouth closed like you chew onions
Motherfucker I'm like "Y'all don't want no problems up in here"
Rather be judged by my jewelry, not a jury of my peers
And I got some kush to hide in her brassiere
Yeah, and we only selling what the boat bring here
Nigga, y'all don't want no problems up in here
Cause I got shooters on the roof like some fuckin' reindeer
And I'm probably with the model of the year
I'm about to go Pac with the nose ring up in here...

Uhh, lifestyles of the rich and famous
Young Money motherfuckin' Entertainment
And y'all know Marley got the chopper up in here
Yeah, me, myself and I, the fuckin' Three Musketeers
Smoke like I fuckin' disappeared
Uhh, I check your pussy ass and wait for it to clear nigga...
Tunechi, everybody know your name like +Cheers+, nigga...
Started from the bottom now my whole team here, nigga
Tunechi!

Yeah, D5, whattup five?
I'm a worry bout me, give a fuck about you
And just as a reminder to myself
Bust every single nut in her motherfuckin' mouth
I'm like "Lord, I hope she swallow more than tears"
Tunechi
