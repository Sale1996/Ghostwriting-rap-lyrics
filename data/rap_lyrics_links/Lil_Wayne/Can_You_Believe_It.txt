[Verse 1: The Game]
Young Stunna, young Stunna
The way that paint drippin it's gon' be a bloody summer
22 inches, all-red everything
That's Soo Woo business, holla at ya 5
4, 3, 2, 1, bitch in the coppet
And my knot's sick, I'm ill
I got a milli in my maze
Red Cardinal fitted, bitches feel me in the Louie, yeah
Red rubies in my watch and my chain
Catch me in Wade County, I'm the king like James
Headed to the Game, Red Challenger today
Throwin' up red flags like I'm challenging the play
Tune, this shit retarded, I need a red helmet
And I'm all about my cake: red velvet
You can't help it, gotta see what I got
It's like Ripley's: Believe it or Not, you tell me

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I'm a Beast, believe that
Stop playing, I go hard, I go He-Man
Young Tune, break em off like a tree branch
Play with me, you in hot water: tea bag
All-black Maybach, call it decaff
And I just ordered your girlfriend some kneepads
Can you believe the unbelievable?
Bitch, I'm higher than Venus, Serena too
Yeah, Game, holla at ya: Soo Woo
Young Money bitch, we cold like two scoops
Life's a bitch and mine a diva
Point the biggest skeptic out I make 'em a believer

[Chorus]

[Verse 3 - Baby]
Yeah, belee dat, a hundred on a marble floor
And everyday we on the grind tryna flip some more
Ya understand, acres on that new land
Suicide doors nigga, on that new Lamb'
P-p-pussy poppin' bullshit
Bullshit ain't shit nigga we the shit
We the business, Louie on every trip
Holiday everyday on the YM ship
Cause everyday my sun shine
Candy paint on the Harley making headlines
Belee dat
We good with this cake homie
Belee dat, we ride every day homie

[Chorus]
