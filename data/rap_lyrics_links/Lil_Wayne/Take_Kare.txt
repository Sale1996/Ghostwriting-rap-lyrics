Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
Boolin' at the basketball game
Dressed in Balmain (Fresh)
Dropped a hundred on the whole thing
Inside cost a whole thing
And I'm a, give you my all, first my whole name
I'm in her mouth just like Colgate
I'm really feelin' super light, aye
Hate me
Like a hate ladies man, like bait
Hop inside a Bentley with a red paper plate
Every time they hate I throw them bands like a bouquet
I ain't Ray J but you can be my Kim K
Feelin' like the flippin' yellow green on like a cape
I don't ever believe what Lil Kim say
Ballin' how you feel, you can jump in my league
Running to my head like a deal in this league
Man, everywhere she go, she ballin'
Yeah she got xans, she like, "Where Tar at?"
She don't gangbang, she say she bang gangs
And she'll fight, might knock 'em out the ring
Had a coke brick, she'll whip it like a whip
I just wanna nut, she say that is easy like a baker
She just want a nigga, I don't serve but I love maple
And that's why she gon' watch me like cable

[Chorus: Young Thug]
Take care of her
If I don't do nothin' in the world, swear to God I'm takin' care of her
Take care of lil mama, take care of baby mama
Take care of her
Take care of her, take care of her
Take care of her

[Verse 2: Young Thug]
On a million, goin' to meet a billion
Bring the Bentley, you can keep the ceiling
Take a trip to Peru, baby suck my dog like Snoop
Blood gang, big ups soo woo
Dinosaur bank roll, woo woo
H&M ballin', ball a hundred ten
Throw my boy 6, bim bim
Baby keep that pussy
Baby keep that pussy clean, trill
Bought a castle with my last deal
Boy don't talk about no fad deal
Lil nigga you laaaaaaaaame, okay
I'm a put the pedal to the race
I'm a pull the pedal, not the brake
Ice inside my ring, you can skate
Yeah this shit cold like a case
That a nigga went and snitched on him with
All these mothafuckin' bitch
I'm the shit, Hell I'm the shit
I'm a build a hole for a snitch, not a ditch
Shit

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
They be hatin' on my girl, though
And they wish they was the bitch they're hatin'
Salutations to my old hoes
And thank you for your participation
No chasin' from a girl though
She go harder than me on, okay
Gettin' wasted with my girl
Then we 69 'til we need ventilation
You don't know about it
Gotta open new accounts cause the others overcrowded
Gotta open up the stores when they're closed when we shoppin'
For my girl, wear the clothes that ain't nobody rockin'
She so bad, I don't know what to do with her
I know just what to do in her
Homies hit me up, they said they're goin' out tonight
I said I'm with my girl, tonight I can't fuck with you niggas
I'm a take care of her

[Chorus: Young Thug & Lil Wayne]
