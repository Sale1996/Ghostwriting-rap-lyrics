[Chorus]
Chop with straight shots and then pop bottles
Flirt with the hood rats then pop models

Okay we poppin' champagne like we won a champ-ion-ship game
Feel like I got on a champ-ion-ship ring
Cuz I ball hard, no bitch we ball harder
I am the Birdman, and I be J.R.-a

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Okay stop with straight and shots then pop bottles
Pour it on the models, shut up bitch swallow
If you can't swallow, shut up bitch goggle
Straight up out that water with my Marc Jacob goggles
Fresher than a mother fucker, yep I'm a mother fucker
No I won't take your girl, but I'll sure take her tub from her
Can't you tell I'm in love woman, like no other woman
Oh I'm sorry sweetheart, I though you were my other woman

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Baby]
As I recline behind my desk
I ain't got a lot of Nikes but I got a lot of checks
Got my own shoe brand, new on the set
Went from sittin' in a cell to sittin' on a jet
From shittin' in a cell to shittin' on a jet
I lost too many friends, but I won too many bets
I made too much money, I didn't make enough yet
So I scratched and yes Jr. is the best
So many niggas from my hood on they back
So many niggas from your hood on they back
That's why we so paid and it be like that
I'd rather pop a bottle before I pop a gat

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Baby]
Yeah only sipping red champagne
White tee red hat red bandanna
Uptown choppers fuck a panya
Fuckin with the birdman we fucking your propanya
Fuckin with my son and we run up in your mansion
Chopper make music bitch start dancin'
Stunna man back so you know the circumstances
And I'm cookin' up the Carter 3, no advances
All my cars automated, automatic
No lie we don't even drive no Astons
Uptown we packin' and we stackin'
Young Money, Cash Money we the champions

[Baby talking]
You already know what it is
Stunna man, Jr. we bounce back like that
Get mills with the mills baby
The last mile its M.O.B. baby, One-hundred

[Chorus]
