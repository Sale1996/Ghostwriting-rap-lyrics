[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Chea
What's up baby?
I ain't tryin to do nothin but get my grown man on
Heh
I ain't tryin to hurt chu
Only if you want me to
Hehe
Yeah something like that

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Yeah What's happenin baby I'm Lil Wayne from New Orleans
Fresh out the Navy now the captain of my own team
Hop in this machine, vanish from the scene
God damn it I'm so manish, handle it like a standard
So put your panties and your pants by the trashcan
Grown man on the floor plans, We hold hands while we rollin
Just trying to keep up with the program, Just tryin to sneak up on ya
Like how you doin, ma'am? I'm an old soul and a young man
We got to it and we didn't stop til the birds hit the block
And she ain't never had it like that hahaha

[Chorus: Lil Wayne] + (Currency)
Girl, you are so fine
I wish that I could get you over here girl
Tonight so I
Could get my grown man on with you
You are so fine
I wish that I could get you over here girl
Tonight so I
Could get my grown man on with you
[Background of second time]
(You don't know bout it, I'm on my grown man x4)

[Verse 2: Currency]
Now I don't really hit the club but tonight I'ma make an acception
But for some reason, I can't seem to keep my eyes out your direction
I'm looking at you so hard I could probably catch a charge
Feeling the way that you walk, when you move, your booty applauds
Damn, I gotta keep my composure
Gotta attack my mission, handle business like a solider
Young man, young money, but the money long
Currency Tha Hot Spitta so grown
And your perception of me is so wrong
Don't worry bout what you heard bout me and them other birds
Mighta done a little dirt and left a few of them hurt
But whatever has occured they all got what they deserved
And you don't rock like them, I can see it in your eyes
If you ain't good for me then you wearing a disguise
Cause tonight, you looking like miss right
And I'm susposed to be a playa for life but I'd change for ya

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
You ain't no woman
You a baby girl living in a ladies world
And I'm a grown man, the women understand
See what I go through is what I owe you
So you should throw that ass back to me right now
Yea Fly boy, baby sit back relaxin
Cruise with a nigga, destination satisfaction
Who says their baby, she say weezy fuckin baby
I say yes in fuckin deed, she says don't you ever leave
I say, I say but I got money on my mind
Then I tell her nevermind and we do it one more time
Hehe, For a large amount of time
Long, it won't stop til daytime come home

[Chorus]

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Damn, look, heh that, oh that right there
That's the sunset girl
Get your visor
Where's those chanelle shades I got you
You always losing things
And I'm always buyin new things heh
I've come a long way, I remember
Remember that block
Look at you, you think you all grown
You ain't no woman
You a baby girl living in a ladies world
And I'm a grown man, the women understand
See what I go through is what I owe you
And you should throw that ass back to me right now
