[Intro]
You niggaz gon' learn today
+D4!+
Y.M.C.M.B.
Nigga!

[Lil Wayne]
Hammer on the dresser, work on the stove
I'm sittin on the counter blowin purp out my nose
Red bone naked, in the bed flexin'
I say bitch I ain't impressed you must of got the wrong impression
I ain't with the BS, I'm flyer than PF
Man, we livin in hell like a deep breath
Real niggaz with real money, real bitches with fake asses
If she don't wanna fuck I get on my skateboard and I skate past her
Money on the table, guns on the table
Bitch I'm on that syrup tell that hoe leggo my Eggo
And my girlfriend is a chopper, I finger fuck that hoe
Hello I am Tunechi - you had me at hello
Uhh, droptop Maybach, clean like Ajax
Man I don't fuck with none of you niggaz like rednecks
We got that work so come and get if we don't know you you pay tax
I put a hole in your apple what that is Applejacks, uh
Pussy nigga I'll murder you then dance at your funeral
Blood I'll have a nigga drinkin his own blood, communion
Wake up like Bone Thugs I'll call your bluff pick the phone up
Her titties fake but they look real - cubic zirconias
Run up in your house spare the kids and kill the grown-ups
Your bitch call me when she hot - Krispy Kream donuts
Shoutout to my new hoes, shoutout to my old hoes
I still wear that ass out like a wardrobe
Bitch, what they gon' say?
Still eatin rappers on my fuckin lunch break
Bad yellow bitch with a tongue like a snake
I let her suck my dick amd then I fuck her to some Drake

[Chorus]
And then I let that kush burn let that kush burn
Yeah I let that kush burn; smokin gasoline, bitch
The booth on fire, I'm in here gettin higher
Younh Money bitch we at the top like barbed wire

[Lil Wayne]
Money on my mind I ain't thinkin bout no bitch
I'm talkin bout that scratch like my muh'fuckin throat itch
Stop stuntin if you ballin buy your bitch somethin
Stayed on the same team like Tim Duncan
Shit get real if you scared go to Catholic school
And if we want it straight jacket/jack-it like a padded room
Shoot your ass 100 times and stand over you
Lil' Tunechi so fly I got arachnophobia
Burn bitch, AK in my firm grip
Leap if you feelin like Kermit, sermons
Preach, reach, and I smoke your ass like Cheech
I be faded like bleach, double barrel - Siamese
I like my swisher obese, fuck that bitch like police
Fuck these haters with no grease, you get chin checked - goatee
Money talks bitch and mine talks like Robin Leach
That lean got me slow as Lisa Turtle, ask Screech
Uhh bank card heavy, my wallet like a barbell
My girl got a fat cat, I call that shit Garfield
We'll bring the O.K. Corral to your doorbell
We pull triggers not coat tails, I make lump sums - oatmeal
I'm stuntin, gettin new money
Trukfit money, Mountain Dew money, tell 'em
I get better like fine wine, I'm fire like cayenne
In the words of my nigga BP, I'll hit a bitch with a car bomb
BOOM~! (Gangsta Grizzill) Lil' bitch
Niggaz gonna talk they ain't talkin bout shit
Niggaz gonna bark I go Mike Vick
Fuckin fuck niggaz, on that fuck shit
Suck a nigga dick, for some Trukfit

[Chorus]
And let that kush burn let that kush
Yeah I let that kush burn; smokin gasoline, bitch
The booth on fire, I'm in here gettin higher
Holla at a nigga if you want that Oscar Mayer

[Outro]
Tune, hahaha, Dedication Fo'
Me, shorty, fuck with me
