{"London on da Track, bitch!"}

[Lil Wayne]
We catch a body and we laugh about it
I fucked her friend, I don't feel bad about it
Grindin', is agonizin' but it's gratifyin'
Skinny tires on a salad diet
Ooh, I lost my mind, I'm like "Fuck everybody"
Yeah, I lost my mind but I got extra copies
Yeah, I fuck so long, it feel like exercisin'
Uh, I test the lyin' before testifyin'
All I got is hitters in my squad
I could get you killed, all my niggas want the job
I could get you killed, it just take a head nod
I want you dead by tonight, that's a real deadline
Zero fucks given
I make her come to the condo butt naked cause bitch ain't no stealin'
She still come visit, she don't wanna leave
She compared it to me, leavin' a witness, I said I get it
I keep some cocaine on me for the bitches
And this AK is not for decoration
Fuckboys give me the heebee-jeebees
I got a hit list like the yellow pages
Hey, if she can suck a dick or snort a Quaalude
Then ooh baby, you got my full attention
Champagne expensive, it taste gooder vintage
Open your nose, I put some sugar in it
I, don't fuck around with them fuckarounds
Uh, I might fuck around and catch a body
Yeah, I got some niggas that'll hunt you down
Yeah, and catch you slippin' like you playin' hockey
Woo, we catch a body and we laugh about it
Uh, I fuck her friend, I don't feel bad about it
Uh, money and drugs, I'm talkin' math and science
Ooh, skinny tires on a salad diet
Uh, chopper leave you with a half a body
Make sure he dead before we leave, my nigga grab his wallet
Ooh, I got the hook up on them rocket launchers
I told Obama "Fuck with me, you know I got it"
Slime, you need to fuck with me you know I got it
I know somebody that know somebody
Look, traffic dyin', we still trap or dyin'
It's agonizin' but it's gratifyin'
... Squad
I could get you killed, all my niggas want the job
I could get you killed, it just take a head nod
Want you dead by tonight, that's a real deadline
Hol' up - you ain't got no hitters in your squad
I could get you killed, that's my real day job
I'm a crime of passion, I'm a fuckin' hate crime
Spit like I ate bombs - Eminem on "8 Mile"
I'm the motherfuckin' man, Scarface, Facemob
Pockets lookin' like the Blob, chips like Cape Cod
Bust your motherfuckin' egg 'til I see egg nog
My bougie bitch ratchet, my ratchet bitch a straight snob
Hold up, who know how to read gang signs?
Cause we gon throw 'em up and we gon give 'em hang time
I got white, I got brown; sell it at the same time
That's that James Brown and that's that James Bond, ooh
We catch a body and we laugh about it
It's catastrophic but we glamorize it
It's agonizin' but it's gratifyin'
Skinny tires on a salad diet
Ooh, chopper leave you with a half a body
No hesitation, no stall like the bathroom crowded
Chopper so big, so tall, it could wrap around me
Triple A, astronomic and atomic

Tunechi, and it's that "Sorry 4 The Wait"
And I'm so sorry for the wait, yeah
