[Lil Wayne]
Uh, I thank the Lord I'm not a broke nigga, I'm dope nigga
Change my name, I ain't like average, Joe nigga
Up above with my above average, hoe nigga
Tight frame with a tight camel, toe nigga
I got killers on the front line, you on the sideline
Follow the guidelines or you be in the skyline
Killers on the inside, and on your blindside
Shoot you right between your motherfuckin eyebrows
Ooh kill 'em, it's that "Carter V", let me get 'em
I'm feelin like John Gotti, Lennon
And you gon' respect my mind and my sign and my emblem
You got money on your mind and we aimin at your temple
Check me out or just be quiet in the library nigga
Or the flowers on your grave gon' be dyin every winter
And as long as I'm alive I'm a financial wizard
Long as I can make a dollar out a dime and a nickle
Thank the Lord I'm not a broke nigga

[Chorus: Snoop Dogg]
I get money, I'm a hustler
So if you're buyin what I'm sellin, you a customer
See I can get it to you anywhere, anythang
But it's point-blank range, when the pistol bang
I mix it up, I fix it up and I switched it up
I locked down this end and got it twisted up
See I'm a dawg, but I loc with my locs
They say "You are what you smoke"

[Interlude: Lil Wayne]
I grew up around dope niggaz
Uh, uh, uh, dope niggaz
I grew up around dope niggaz

[Lil Wayne]
Yeah, I grew up around dope niggaz, and cold killers
And most niggaz was both nigga, two-sport niggaz
I was no different from those niggaz, but I was chose nigga
See those niggaz somewhere with me in these hoes nigga
Momma was a go-getter, a coach nigga
Taught me everything I know nigga, a soul sister
Taught me how to be a goaltender, support system
For that bitch who played her role wit'cha, and those children
I ain't lyin slime, all my niggaz ballin, it's a fuckin team sport
I could change the world, but I done lost the remote
All my niggaz ballin, it's how it's supposed to be, hoe
I could change the world, I'd rather change to beast mode
Coke sniffers, and dope stickers
And most niggaz was both nigga, explode nigga
Pop a motherfuckin cork nigga, to those niggaz
Cause life's too fuckin short nigga, get old nigga
I ain't lyin, got a gold mirror just to see my goals clearer
Be a role player, role model while you roll with 'em
They say you don't need to be with us, stay on the road nigga
That way I wouldn't come to the end of the road with 'em
Man, all my niggaz targets, that's includin me, hoe
I could change the world, I'd rather change the people
And definitions cause we're defined by our legal roles
All your haters fuelin, my needle broke
Lord, I ain't a broke nigga

[Interlude: Lil Wayne]
I thank the Lord I ain't a broke nigga
I thank the Lord I ain't a broke nigga!

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne over Chorus]
I thank the Lord I ain't a broke nigga!

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
I grew up around dope niggaz
Uh, uh, uh, dope niggaz
I grew up around dope niggaz
I thank the Lord I ain't a broke nigga!
