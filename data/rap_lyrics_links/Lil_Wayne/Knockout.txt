[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Uh! Yeahhh
Ohhh! Yayyyyy...

[Lil Wayne]
Hey Barbie! Are-are-are are you into black men?
Hey hey hey, hey Barbie! Hey, I could be your black Ken, wow!
Cause once you go black, you never go back
She wear her hair black, with curls in the back
The she threw that ass back back back, then I fell to the mat
And after that, everything went BLACK!

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Baby one-two-three.. tell 'em get the referee
Cause he can (he can) get the knockout (get the knockout)
Get the telephone please, it's an emergency
Cause he can (he can) get the knockout (get the knockout)

[Lil Wayne]
Hey Barbie! Can I call you Barbara? Ha ha
Hey Barbie! Yeah can I call you tomorrow, and? today?
Cause once you go black, you never go back
And when she go to Wayne, everybody else is whack
The she threw that ass back back back, then I fell to the mat
And after that, everything went BLACK!

[Chorus]

[Nicki Minaj]
Uhhh, uhhh
Awww fuck it! Give me that damn bucket
When when I throw this pussy you better not start duckin
OH, YO, HIT HIT 'EM WITH THE BLOW
Look look out in the crowd and everybody's yellin no
Grab him by his locks and give us a good box
Then hit him below the belt I wanna give him good top
TOP! TOP! Give him good top!
Hit him below the belt I want to give him good top!
One-two-three they yellin one-two-three
I done hit 'em with that motherfuckin crunk two piece
Tell 'em, tell 'em to mop out, too late to copout
Give 'em little head then toupee, that's a knockout!

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
So just knock me out! {*2X*}
Damn... just knock me out!
So just knock me out, just knock me out
Just knock me out {*3X*}
