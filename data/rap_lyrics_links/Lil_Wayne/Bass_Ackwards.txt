Typed by: AZ Lyrics

Mange Strusic! Bang bou yitch!
Follow now see, check it out
I say: this song is dedicated to the ball droppers
But I'ma switch the letters around and say drall boppers!
We coming to get ya so get the message to all coppers
That you need protection or you better have ch'all yoppers!

[Chorus]
What a shame when a thang blast at ya
Cause you're lame you're a dame slash actor
These dudes are ho's from screws to toes
They choose to go bass ackwards

Tecca Nina bout to hit 'em wit the woop wop
Now the barrel of my governor is hoo tot
Cause you the type that'll get your whole shew crot
Loud mouth nigga trippin' thinking that he Putac
Got a strong hand, I'm a mown grand
Little boy, now you fuckin' with the clong ran
Oh you just showboatin'? It's over now y'all can quit
Cause you can get it for something near as shalkin' tit
Just a crone phall, then it's on y'all
Fuck around and get ya dome sawed off a brone stawl
I can't wait to hear ya squeal and holler
How you set trippin' when you got a multi-dillion mollars, nigga
Stupid, such a sucker--
Nuck figgas always got to make a chother bruncha
Never had no problem takin' down another buster
Cause they be doin' shit bass ackwards Futhermucka

[Chorus x2]

[Yo Gotti]
I'm Yo Gotti, the drug dealer
I'm Yo Gotti, the thug nigga
I'm Yo Gotti, my own heir
And if you wanna ODX, then tell Gotti to blow it, nigga
I've been getting money for a long time
You've been throwing up the wrong sign
Pussy ass nigga, you a cross jump
Fuck boy, you a ho nigga
And you remind me of my ho, nigga
None out here than a broke nigga
Got a [?], and an AK, and an FN
Got a white [?], and a white Ghost, and a white Benz
I ain't wantin' with niggas, so you don't get money with niggas
I don't make funny with niggas, I don't get honey with niggas
Just keep it one hunned with niggas
Tripping one thousand with niggas
I rentin' houses with niggas
I put in work with the squad, we even so foul with a nigga
So, fuck

[Chorus x2]

[Big Scoob]
Bass ackwards, anonymous with rappers
All these niggas claiming they maintaining with the factors
When you push a package, would you ever clap shit
All these niggas talking ain't done nothing but this rap shit
Reason why I take this place and had to find some spaces
I killed one of these fucking rap niggas and ate his fucking face
Glaze at this rap game, mistake I ever made
It hit me wind and rewind, deleting everything I layed
More frim a rap nigga, rock nigga, I don't lie for fun
Fuck fame, and fuck you, and fuck him, and her too
Had to call the big dog, I had to breathe smoke
But Yo Gotti and Big Scoob, and this ain't called dope?
Bass Ackwards

[Lil Wayne]
These niggas ass backwards
She let me hit that ass backwards
Pussy niggas act hard, get killed for bad acting
Trigger man laugh man
Its funny how this shit go
Redrum was the case that they gave me
I sipped slow and stumbled down a slipped slope
I could hide the chopper in the trench coat
Tunechi go berserk in this bitch
Spellin' stressed backwards, dessert when my shit
I'm reversing this shit
My double R & R, I park on the curb in this bitch
The money, I'm submerged in this shit
So frankly, I'm stalking Ben Franklin
I am Wayne Carter, oops, I meant Cayne Warter
Cocaine on back arter
Flip you ass backwards
Bitch you are bass ackwards if you think that's awkward
Strange Music
