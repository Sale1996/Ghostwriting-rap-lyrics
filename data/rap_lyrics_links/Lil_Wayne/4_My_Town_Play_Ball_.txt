[Intro: Birdman]
Yeah
So priceless
Life so priceless nigga
You understand me, it's just like that
My car so priceless
My bitch so priceless
My familia is so priceless nigga
You understand me?
Either you with us
Or you ain't with us
Either you in tha huddle
Or you out the huddle
Either you ridin'
Or we passin', flyin' by saying fuck ya
It's Young Money Cash Money playboy
That's about the size of 'em
At the roof top
So hot up here nigga
YEAHHH
LET'S GO!

[Chorus: Drake]
Take yourself a picture when I'm standing at the mound
And I swear it's going down, I'm just reppin' for my town
Off a cup of C.J. Gibson, man I'm faded off the pound
And I'm easily influenced by the niggas I'm around
See that Aston Martin when I start it hear the sound
I ain't never graduated I ain't got no cap and gown
But the girls in my class who were smart enough to pass
Be at all my fucking parties, grabbing money off the ground

[Drake]
Yeah, all hail Mr. Lyrical
Spades of the Opus baby
What you got a feeling for
I can show you new things
Have you feeling spiritual
Pastor Kerney Thomas to these hoes' miracles!
Yeah ok they say that I'm the one in fact
Some say that I'm they favorite
But I ain't hearing none of that
I'm all about my team hoe, Young Money running back
Cash money superstar, where the fuck is Stunna at?

[Birdman]
Untouchable, 40 with my AK, master mind
Big money heavyweight
On the grind, flippin' money in every way
Headlines, my bitch shine everyday
Pearl white
Don P., Marc Jacob glove
Cartier Louis case with a dope blood
From the mud where they wet you
Leave you in ya blood
Goin' in flip a hundred get the young plug
Show 'em where it go, floatin' on the float
Gettin' mo' dough, grind hard, go!
Black diamond show, watch the flame blow
And how you stay grounded, cash no go
And how you stay mounded, cash no flow
And how you stay shinin', Bentley off the floor
And how you stay high, purple pine dro
Diamond mink furs, February snow.

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
CJ, YEAH, STUNNA!
Uhhh, you know you're paid
When you got Baby with you
It's Young Money, like Ben Frank's baby pictures
I'm the lady twista, I kiss her whiskers
I been runnin' this shit, blisters
Stickin' to the script, movie star money
And if you gassed up, I leave the car runnin'
I'm a big smoker, I'm a little drinker
The peace sign is just a trigger and the middle finger
W-what you know 'bout it, man y'all clueless
I let two women ride me, that's carpoolers
I rock stupid ice, Mr. Water Coolers
If y'all in the building, then we are intruders
Simmer me down pimpin', let me handle this
I know the game, analyst
Man I'm the shit, and y'all janitors
Blow out the kush and crack a smile for the cameras!

[Chorus]

[Baby Talking]
Drizzy
One hundred
