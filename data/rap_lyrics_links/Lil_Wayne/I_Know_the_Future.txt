[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Young Money motherfuckers, uh-huh
Thats right, I thought you knew, hahaha
I'm a beast, east side
I can let a beat come

[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
Straight from the bottom its the Carter
I give it to these bitch niggas like momma taught me
One man with no weapon at war but I'm an army
My flow is capturing attention, leutenant your penny pention
And they demolished that invention
You better get your dollars up
And guess what I was up
I get my cheese like Mickey Mouse
Or else you better Donald Duck
Like a shootin range target I get all kind of bucks
Be my shootin range target, nigga I got good luck
Nigga bye bye good luck, got ya momma shook up
Little bad ass nigga who thought Popeye wasnt tough
I'm on that lala twist it up, I'm on that syrup slow it down
And I like four freaks too and young choppers goin down
About a marijuana field and I just smoke it down
Big bad wolf yes, I just blow it down, no homo
And to Holly Grove I will hold it down
Like a circle of knives, I got the sharpest flow around
Feel me

[Chorus]
I know, I-I-I know, I-I know, I-I-I know, I know
I-I-I know, I Know they can't fuck with me
Because I came to fuck the world
I know, I-I-I know, I-I know, I-I-I know, (Fuck the world) 
I know, I-I-I know, I Know they can't fuck with me
(Bitch I'm Mack Maine) Because I came to fuck the world

[Verse 2: Mack Maine]
I got the heart of a king blood of a slave
Feel like I been here before
my second time to the grave
But its one life to live thats why I'm gettin paid
off a flow thats priceless I just got it appraised
Spit like I need a raise blaze as I gaze
At the stars next to lord while the coppers at the porpit
It make me sick to stomach thats why I rap
Like a pregnant women I dont spit I vomit
So pay homage me and Wayne two G's
Like 20 Hundred and we keep the semi's blunted
And we live like brothers from another
So fuck with him and Mack gon react like you did me somethin
Thats a hint to you Davids throwin shots to Giliath
This the new testament where the victor is the giant
So you should get your weight and lose the hate
Remember males shouldn't be jealous thats a female trait
Feel me

[Chorus]
I know, I-I-I know, I-I know, I-I-I know, I know
I-I-I know, I Know they can't fuck with me
Because I came to fuck the world
I know, I-I-I know, I-I know, I-I-I know, (Fuck the world) 
I know, I-I-I know, I Know they can't fuck with me
Because I came to fuck the world
