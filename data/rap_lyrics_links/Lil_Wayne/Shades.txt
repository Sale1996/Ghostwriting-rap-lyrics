[Lil Wayne]
Uhhh~!
Before you get here put yo' panties in yo' pocketbook
That's what I told her over the Motorola, Hennessy and cola
I hold her at attention with my manners
And even though I don't roll a camera
She still performs like the superstar she truly are
So - also I think I love her already
Damn - I think I... already
She must be the one; I look in her eyes and see the sun
Even on rainy days, ain't it crazy mayne?
Yeah, that's what I said
She do doughnuts in my head
Over, and over, and over
'Til the cops pull her over
And then she say some real slick shit like
"I'm on my way from Weezy baby," cheah
And of course they let her go

[Diddy] Let me take off my shades

[Bilal] + (Diddy)
I know I've got a lot of baggage
It's for the ladies and Mercedes
Yes and I know that it's heavy
but I pray that someone will grab it, for me
Yeah, I know I've got a lot of baggage
Full of Chanel's and Tiffany's and broken hearts girl
You need me baby it's hard to break a habit, for me, yeah
And girl if you want (what do you want me to do?)
I'll pour a gallon of gasoline on my heart
Just to light your cigarette; and girl if you want
(I'll do anything for you)
I'll do anything for you (I'll even take off my shades)
I'll even take off my shades
And stare right at the sun from the stage
(I'll even try different things)
I'll even try different things
I'll make love to you on marmalade (never made love on marmalade)
I'll even change my name, name, what'cha say?
(I'll be what ever you say) I'll be what ever you say
I'll even take off my shades
I'll make love to you on marmalade
(Are you sure that's what you want to do?)
If that's what you wannna do

[Chorus 2X: Bilal + James Fauntleroy]
What'chu gonna do? What'chu gonna do
when I'm perfect for you, girl watch how it's gon' drive you crazy
(What'chu gonna do?) And love's gon' turn you out baby
(What'chu gonna do?) Girl watch how it's gon' drive you crazy

[James Fauntleroy] + (Diddy)
Got a lot of baggage
It's full of shades, different shades, and I'm sharp as a razor
That's why I have to brand it - you talkin 'bout me?
(You talkin' bout me? Listen to me)
I know I've got a lot of baggage
It's full of promises that why I keep a lock on it
I promise girl I'm tryin to make it happen, for me, and you babe
Now girl if you wanna pour a gallon of gasoline on my heart
and light it, if you get lonely
If you call me - girl if you want me
I'm ready when you are, just tell me you want me

[Chorus]

[Justin Timberlake]
Black, gray, white
If I pulled down these shades would it sound too bright?
Get it, sound too right?
Maybe I'm just feelin myself because
"Flashin lights, come from everywhere"
And you can feel that somethings blowin in the air tonight
Now, if you need that fire I'll be that propane
If you need it wet, I can make it pour rain
But maybe I won't, heh, maybe you just have to take it
Go ahead, pretend I'm a drug, now let me see you shake it
I can read your mind, read your mind, Professor X
We can press rewind, press rewind, VHS
Speakin of the past, it's so futuristic behind ya
Let me fill up your plate and dish it out, dish it out, china
I'ma bend yo' body, bend yo' body, Magneto
Let me have my way, I'ma have my way, Carlito
Now we can put in work, let me get my busy on for you
You ain't never heard you talk like this I got my Drizzy on for you

[Chorus]
