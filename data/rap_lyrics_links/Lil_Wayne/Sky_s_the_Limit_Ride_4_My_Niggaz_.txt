Ahem
Weezy yo
Young Money, Cash Money
This is, "Da Drought 3"
Ladies and Gentlemen, you know me

[Verse 1]
You know I ride for my mother fuckin' niggas
Most likely I'm a die with my finger on the trigger
They tell me don't get high and I should try and make a living
I tell 'em I'm a hustler and I'd rather make a killing
My eyes be so wide as they rise in the skillet
I let my bitch bag it, if she spill it I'm a kill her
I bullet-proof the ride now I feel like armadillos
And fuck a hospital, Young Money we the illest
And I ain't gotta lie when I tell you I'm the illest
My flow is nasty like CY Phillies
Self-made G and them bitches know the business
We lightin' all rappers in the kitchen, I'm a chemist
And when I was five my favorite movie was The Gremlins
Ain't got shit to do with this but I just thought that I should mention
You lookin' for divine, and a little intervention 
And the Byrds don't fly without my permission
I'm probably in the sky, flyin' with the fishes
Or maybe in the ocean, swimmin' with the pigeons
See my world is different, like Dwayne Wade
And if you want trouble bitch, I want the same thang

[Chorus]
And you know that I'm a ride with my mother fuckin' niggas
Most likely I'm a die with my finger on the trigger
Don't worry 'bout mine,  I'm a grind 'til I get it
 And tell all of my niggas that the Sky Is the Limit
The Sky Is the Limit
and if you look high you'll see that I'm gon' be in it

[Verse 2]
Fuck ten in the coup and your bitch love it
Switchin' lanes, fast third then she switch subjects
Tell a bitch "don't talk to me,
And if you talkin' to them niggas, don't talk for free"
And I hate when a nigga say, "talk is cheap"
'Cause I'm the type to let money talk for me, yeah
My flow is art unique, yeah
My flow can part a sea
The only thing on the mind of a shark is eat
By any means and you just sardines 
I got the 40 cal tucked in my PRP's
What do you expect, I'm from New Orleans 
And the guarantee of my city is riders
They tryin' to make a brand-new map without us
But the tourists come down and spend too many dollars
And no matter how you change it it'll still be ours

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And you don't want to fuck with a soldier
Use your head or I'll take it off your shoulders
Run up in your house and shoot everyone that sittin' on a living room sofa (that's fucked up)
And you don't want to fuck with a soldier
Use your head or I'll take it off your shoulders
Mail it to your mom with a dozen a roses (now that's fucked up)
And I'm a G, and you ain't gotta know the alphabets to see
I know my whole city is depending on me
And I forget a lot of shit, but I cannot forget the streets

[Chorus]
