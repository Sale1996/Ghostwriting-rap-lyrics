[Chorus]
If you hear before you see me 
I got king kong in the trunk
King kong, king, king, king, king Kong, King
King Kong, King, King, King, King Kong
(What it is) If you hear before you see me 
(What it is) If you hear before you see me 
(What it is) If you hear before you see me 
I got King Kong in the trunk
King kong, king, king, king, king Kong, King
King Kong, King, King, King, King Kong
If you hear before you see me 
I got king kong

[Lil Wayne]
I pop my trunk and everybody get to running
The fireman bitch, like my body in the oven
I'm one egg short, I'm just tryin to get a dozen
My name like honey, it got alotta bitches buzzing
The neck of the barrel, is so long and narrow
And it shoot a bunch, you just lunchin and munching like Farrel
Bloodshot eye's on the sparrow
And I stay high, but on-point like an arrow
Street nigga baby, I'm in love with the gravel
Money gives me life like a man with the gavel
I'm strapped at home, I'm strapped when i travel
I pop my trunk and make the bitches spread like cattle

[Chorus]
King Kong, king, king, king, king kong, king
King Kong, king, king, king, king Kong
If you hear before you see me [x3]
I got king kong in the trunk
King kong, king, king, king, king Kong, King
King Kong, King, King, King, King Kong
If you hear before you see me 
I got King, I got King Kong

[Lil Wayne]
(I got King Kong in the trunk)...and I feed him banana clips
And let him sing, like Gladys Knight and the Pips
I'm just sticking to the muthafuckin manuscript
Understand I'm tryin to get the chips and the dip
Better know I hold that gun, with a Panther grip
My hollow bullets got tips, like a dancer bitch
Where my money? Where my money? You need to answer quick
Gotta get back on my ransom shit.. and put you (in the trunk) 
So you'll be laying, ontop of speakers
Holes all in you, like an old pair of sneakers
Before I do a day, on the edge, I will leap first
Bet you any money that, I will land feet first
Married to the Benjamins, battle all my enemies
Riding with Big Foot, Harry, and the Hendersons
Godzilla, King Kong and if I have to park
I will open up my trunk and it will be Jurassic Park

[Chorus]
King Kong, king, king, king, king kong, king
King Kong, king, king, king, king Kong
If you hear before you see me [x3]
I got king kong in the trunk
King kong, king, king, king, king Kong, King
King Kong, King, King, King, King Kong
If you hear before you see me 
I got King, I got King Kong
