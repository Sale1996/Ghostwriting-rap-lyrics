Intro:
Hahaha, Oh you we here
Young weezy baby, Owwohh
 
(Chorus)
I wont deny it, I'm a fuckin rider
You dont wanna fuck with me ha
I bet she dont wanna fuck with me
Cause who wouldnt wanna fuck with me
Now I cant tell you shit about the next miami goon
That aint got nothin on me
So baby you should you should bury him
And just marry me, just marry me 
{music slows down}
 
verse 1:
Haha okay I'm lookin for a raya bone
And when I get her, I'ma tap it like a faya phone
And shorty talk about her man, she said she tired of him
I said well baby I'ma have ya tryin to hide from him
And if its weezy then the women wanna lie to him
And I'ma give it to em, mama said give it to em
So I'ma give it to her just the way she want it
I said girl I'm tryin to put my name on it
I'm tryin to own it welcome to my ranch and I'ma act a donkey
From the mornin to the night to the mornin
And if you back it up then I'ma a jump on it
 
(Chorus)
I said I wont deny her shorty is a rider
And she gon ride for me
I said she lookin like my bride to be
I take one knee, let me take one knee
And I said baby will you marry me
We will ever after happily
Just the way its supposed to be
Just you and me, just you and me
 
Verse 2:
Haha yeah shorty said she want a rider
And I could be that image, more like a provider
I can provide her and if you lookin for me
I'm probably inside her, you only like her
I'm tryin to wife her, see I'ma lighter
And shes my fire, see we are tighter
Than grip plyers, she gets me higher
Higher than my purp, shorties so bright
When you look at her make your eyes hurt
Better get a visor
oh yeah shes cold yeah shes cooler than an iceburg
Fuck what you might heard
You only like her, I'm tryin to wife her
 
(Chorus)(Voice synthesized)
I said I wont deny her shorty is a rider
And she gon ride for me
I said she lookin like my bride to be
I take one knee, let me take one knee
And I said baby will you marry me
We will ever after happily
Its just the way that its supposed to be
Just you and me, just you and me
