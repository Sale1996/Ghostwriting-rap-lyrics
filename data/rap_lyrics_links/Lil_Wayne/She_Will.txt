[Lil Wayne]
{*clears throat*}
I tell her... "Now gon' pop that pussy for a real nigga"
I already know that life is deep, but I still dig her
Niggaz is jealous, but really I could care less
I'm in Hell's Kitchen with an apron and a hairnet
Devil on my shoulder, The Lord is my witness
So on my Libra scale, I'm weighin sins and forgiveness
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop
Karma is a bitch, well just make sure that bitch is beautiful
Life on the edge, I'm danglin my feet
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me
Haters can't see me, nose-bleed seats
and today I went shoppin, and talk is still cheap
I rock to the beat of my drum set
I've been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet, hehe
But I'm, Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split 
(Uh!)

[Chorus: Drake]
...She just started to pop it for a nigga 
and looked back, told me "Baby, it's real"
...And I say, "I ain't doubt you for a second" 
I squeeze it, I could tell how it feel
...I wish we could take off and go anywhere 
but here, baby you know the deal
But she bad, so maybe she won't 
Uh~! But shit, then again, maybe she will
Yeah, do it for the realest niggaz in the fuckin game right now, she will
Yeah, do it for the realest niggaz in the fuckin game right now, she will
She will, she will, (uh) maybe for the money and the power and the fame right now, she will
She will, she will, (uh) do it for the realest niggaz in the fuckin game right now, she will
She will, she will, she will...

[Lil Wayne]
(Yeah...)
I tell her... "Now gon' pop that pussy for a real nigga"
Haters cain't see me but them bitches still lookin for me
And you could take it to the bank, and deposit that
Put your two cents inm and get a dollar back
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack
I'm all about +I+, give the rest of the vowels back
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine
Eat her 'til she cry, call that "wine and dine"
Try to check me and I'ma have 'em checkin pulses
They say choose wisely, that's why I was chosen
Rockin like asphalt, it's the cash's fault
Looked in the face of death, and took its mask off
Now I like my house big and my grass soft
I like my girl face south, and her ass north
But I'm, Ray Charles to the bullshit
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split 
(Uh!)

[Chorus]

{*lights lighter*}
[Wayne] Ladies and gentlemen, Drizzy (Uh!)

[Chorus w/ Wayne "WOOOOOOW" ad-libs]
