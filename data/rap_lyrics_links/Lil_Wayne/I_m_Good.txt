[Intro: DJ Drama]
Y'all ready? Dedication, 5
{"GANGSTA GRIZILLZ!"}

[The Weeknd] + (Lil Wayne)
Everything I said I'd do, I did
I'm good, I'm good
Everything I said I'd do, I did (I did it)
Hm-mm, yeah (D5!)

But baby let's face it
I'm not into datin'
I haven't been patient
Ever since I been famous, my time has been racin'
My motives are basic
This life I've been chasin'
These hearts I've been breakin' (I'm sorry)
And these girls I been tastin' don't never get naked
They like it in a headlock, fuck 'em from behind (woo!)
Fuck 'em with their clothes on, put it to the side (woo!)
Feelings to the side (woo!) like a don do
Get 'em wet, let it slide like a sunroof
Got goals, got dreams, got a hotel crib
Got niggas that'll die for the prince
Got my city on lock, XO 'til the death
Left town in a coach, came back in a jet

I'm good (I'm good) I'm not livin' like I did before
I'm good (I'm good) I'm good (I'm better)
I said I'm good (I'm good, Stunna)
Everything I said I'd do, I did
I'm good (D5! Mack) said I'm good (gone)
Oh, I've been good (we on that GT poppin')
I've been out there puttin' down that work
I'm good (I got that work baby) said I'm good (I put it down baby)
I said I'm good (Rich Gang - so good)
Everything I said I'd do, I did
I'm good (I did it) mu'fucker I'm good (mu'fucker)
Yeah

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
This is dedicated, to everybody who forgot
Forgetful, motherfuckers
Remember - don't you remember?
I been good, we good, D5, whattup five?
