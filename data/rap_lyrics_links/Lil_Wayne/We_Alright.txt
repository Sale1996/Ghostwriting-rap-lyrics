[Euro]
Yeah... it's Euro, check
I couldn't have done it better, I couldn't have done this shit any other way
I made it now when they tried to convince me to make it another day
Glad I can see another day
I do this shit for my squad, my home team, my family, fuck what another say
I'm here now, it's all clear now; somebody po' up
I'm eatin' good, y'all can't see my competition 'til I throw up
I'm to' up but I keep shit 100, that's from the toes up
Last night it felt like I ran through four clubs
Stood on the couch and everyone of em' screamin' out "Hoes down and bros up!"
It's different when we show up, kickin' doors up
I'm a young Stunna, young Wayne, I'm Young Money, I'm growed up
Like I'm new here but I'm nuclear; that's a bomb threat mothafucker, watch how I blow up
I'm good, I'm reminded I'm good from time to time
I'm fine, I be spendin' time with the Greatest Of All Time all the time
And ever since I'm livin' life every night like it's '99
I'm way ahead of my time I think I was only eight at that time
I, rep them five letters forever
Will someone just tell the bartender to mix my drink
while I mix my thoughts my business in pleasure, I'm clever
Long money all around me; I just hope I live long enough, long enough to measure
We should take pictures sippin' Cristal in Coogi sweaters
And I'm still gettin' better nigga, what's better?
They said I never do it now I'm lookin' around like, nigga what's never?
And now they run from us when they see us, boy that money's pressure, hehe
Plaques on the wall of every building that I walk into
Phone taps cause they curious, careful what you talk into
Living the star life you'll never know you'll run into like
"Baby I can change your life, just leave everything that you been through and ride"

[Chorus: Euro]
Long as my niggas right then we alright
Long as the women right then we alright
Long as the drinks on ice then we alright
Long as these private flights then we alright
Long as we livin' right then we alright
Long as it's high life then we alright
Cause I love it more than anything
Boy it's money over everything, we been alright

[Birdman]
Anythang...
Yeah, It's money over everythang
We motivated, flyin' over everythang
We make somethin' out of nothin', whattup 5?
Bag full of every president that ever died
Yea, sprayin' everythang that's in the way
We eatin' over here extended clips, 50 plates
It's a lifestyle, stunna life, everyday
A million ones we can throw this shit a million ways
Youngin, if you alright then we alright
Night life, GTV poppin' every night
Fly rich in a different city bright lights
With my niggas, Rich Gang and livin' high life
Yeah, guns in the basement
Millions in the wall, GTV cases
If it's fuck em' then it's fuck em' all
Audemars and cigars in them new toys - BLAAAT~!

[Chorus]

[Birdman - over Chorus]
Yeah... I bought the rent boy!
Yeah young Euro, the greatest ever
Moolah, let's get it

[Lil Wayne]
Do this shit for rizzeal
Young Money, Rich Gang, ya heard me, with big ears
You just a crocodile, I drink a full cup of his tears
Canât recognize you nigga, like Santa cut off his beard
And Tunechi, he gonâ be alright as long as he got his pills
Iâm higher than my bitch bills; stop cryin bout' 'em, bitch chill
I'm working on that "Carter 5", I got this bitch in fifth gear
I can't stand these niggas, I'mma lie down or sit still
Get tied down with that fuckin' steel at your eyebrow or your fuckin' grill
Catch you while you layed up, straight up - bunny ears
I shoot your fucking fade up, ratchets don't touch me
If that pussy smell like catfish, salmon, trout or guppies
I ain't trippin on no ho, treat that ho like a servant
I know that ho better know, how to deep throat like a serpent
But lose lips sink ships, but I just let these hoes Worship
She think I'm a window of opportunity, close curtains
Tunechi~!

[Chorus] - 2X

[Lil Wayne - over Chorus]
Ha-HA! We alright! We alright!
Alright, alright! Alright, alright! Alright, alright!
Young Money over everything! WOO!
We alright! You alright! We alright!
Alright, alright! Alright, alright! Fuckin' right!
