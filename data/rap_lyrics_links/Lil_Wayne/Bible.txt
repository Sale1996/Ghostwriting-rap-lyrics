[Intro: Yo Gotti]
Yeah, hand on my gun, hand on my bible
Bible, yeah, hand on my gun

[Chorus: Yo Gotti]
Praying to my gun it be my bible
Me and two bitches in the shower
Too sauced up on these hoes, I'm going viral
Jackboy, I sell his ass a brick of flour
Hand on my gun, hand on my bible, bible
Hand on my gun, hand on my bible, bible
Hand on my gun, hand on my bible
Praying to my gun it be my bible

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
Ima dope boy never fold never told grand on overload
In the kitchen with the stove, baking soda, pot and bowl
Swear to God I'll kill a nigga then repent
Im a millionaire and I grind for every cent (Amen)
Plug came that's a blessing
Fuck these hoes I ain't stressing (never)
Leave the house with no weapon
Ima make sure the money right no discrepancies
Grind mode
Young nigga had a quarter pound but he stayed down down front row at the SuperBowl
Team strong we campaign pop champagne win the SuperBowl
I can change the flow up (flow up)
I can take that work inside the kitchen make it blow up
You want a sack I make it show up (show up)
Don't make me bring that Lam out just to pick your hoe up (lil nigga)

[Chorus: Yo Gotti]
Praying to my gun it be my bible
Me and two bitches in the shower
Too sauced up on these hoes, I'm going viral
Jackboy, I sell his ass a brick of flour
Hand on my gun, hand on my bible, bible
Hand on my gun, hand on my bible, bible
Hand on my gun, hand on my bible
Praying to my gun it be my bible

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Hand on my gun hand on my bible
Just hit a lick for 500 thousand
Just copped a whip for 500 thousand
That loud had 500 pounds of it (preach)
Dope boy I got money and the power (preach)
My job pay 100 grand a hour (preach)
My hoe want me to fuck her in the shower (preach)
My hoe want me to fuck her for a hour (preach)
Little money nigga we ain't never accepted that
Big choppas any beef you know we dealt with that
These watches like trophies
These niggas like vultures
These bitches like roaches and we good with that

[Chorus: Yo Gotti]
Praying to my gun it be my bible
Me and two bitches in the shower
Too sauced up on these hoes, I'm going viral
Jackboy, I sell his ass a brick of flour
Hand on my gun, hand on my bible, bible
Hand on my gun, hand on my bible, bible
Hand on my gun, hand on my bible
Praying to my gun it be my bible

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Church, hand on my gun hand on my bible
Fingers on the trigger like vagina
The bible open right there on the dresser
I just pray that all my enemies are watching me from heaven
I'm peeking round the corner before I turn that muthafucka
I played them corners like I'm Richard Sherman muthafucka
I play in my position on these niggas 1st and 10
Treating that prescription like a scripture amen
Now we in the kitchen with the chickens and the hens
Lord please forgive us but we sinning for the rent
I just popped 2 pills I feel them bitches kickin in
0-100 got a ticket in the Benz
Show me where the bible say thou shall not ball
I just hit a lick for a thousand Adderalls
I just rolled a blunt up in a page from the bible
And all my niggas psycho and all my bitches spiteful
John 3:16

[Chorus: Yo Gotti]
Praying to my gun it be my bible
Me and two bitches in the shower
Too sauced up on these hoes, I'm going viral
Jackboy, I sell his ass a brick of flour
Hand on my gun, hand on my bible, bible
Hand on my gun, hand on my bible, bible
Hand on my gun, hand on my bible
Praying to my gun it be my bible

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Hand on my bible
Hand on my bible
Hand on my gun, hand on my bible
That be my bible, yeah, Tunechi
