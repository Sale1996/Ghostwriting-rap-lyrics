(Weezy)
Open up your hearts people
Page One, chapter one
Verse motherfucking one

Yeah, ah-huh
I'm drinkin hot tea bitch
Feel me

Yeah
Now if you let me
You won't regret me
Shit if you let me
You won't forget me
Remember?
And if you don't then ponder
Hold up 
There's a reminder
I ain't kinda hot
I'm sauna
I sweat money
And the bank is my shower
Ha-ha and that pistol is my towel
So stop sweatin me coward
And I would
Die for ours
Ride for hours
Supply the flowers
This is history in the makin
Now shut the fuck up and let me make it

(Chorus)
Please don't shoot me down
Cuz I'm flyin
I'm flyin
I'm higherrrrr

Please don't shoot me down
Cuz I'm flyin	(I swear this tea is at a real good temperature right
I'm higherrrrr	now--so am I)

(Weezy)
I spit Alcatraz bars, I know
And D-boys is the only Alphabet Boys I know
Got a .380 on my waist and Rambo at home
No more bandanna round my dome
Bandanna in my right pocket
Bitch I'm grown
Fuck what you on
Now watch me stand on the world
As I sit in a throne
And if I jump I'ma fly and look into the eagle's eye
And see I am nothing like you
Why
Bitch see
It gets me how nothing gets me
Or get to me
And if you shootin for the stars
Then just shoot me
But your bullets don't reach Mars
Paws, claws
Because I'm a beast I'm a dog
I getcha
My picture should me in dictionary
Next to the definition, of definition
Because repetition is the father of learnin
And son I know your barrel burnin but

(Chorus)
Please don't shoot me down
Cuz I'm flyin
I'm flyin
I'm higherrrr

Please don't shoot me down
Cuz I'm flyin
I'm higherrrrr

(Weezy)
Ay!  Talked to my daddy
Papa I did it to em!
I'm a bastard!
And I'ma do it again
Like nigga backwards
These niggas backwards
But they behind us
Now watch me get high
Like time's up
Naw D, brung the drums back
And watch me hit em where they lungs at
Like that
I get respect
Cuz if I don't, I'ma take it
I see ya boy Satan
And I see ya girls naked
Drum--sound like a naked gun
Switch clips with my thumb
Then I pop another clip in
And aim at his vision
Cuz Wayne is his vision
Cuz Wayne is the mission
I'm aimin at a mirror

(Chorus)
Please don't shoot me down
Cuz I'm flyin
I'm flyin			(And I've done it before)
I'm higherrrr			(Please don't make me do it no more)

Please don't shoot me down
Cuz I'm flyin			(Watch me soar)
I'm higherrrrr			(Where the fuck is my guitar, now roar)

Please don't shoot me down
Cuz I'm flyin
I'm flyin
I'm higherrrrrr
