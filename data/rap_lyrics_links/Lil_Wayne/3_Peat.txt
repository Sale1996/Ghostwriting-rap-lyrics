[Lil Wayne]
Yessir, they can't stop me...
Even if they stopped me ha ha ha... yahh

I'm on it, oooh I'm on it
I'm so on it and however you on it
You can get it tonight ho, and all night ho
I took the beat from *Maestro* uh fucking right ho
I might go crazy on these niggas I don't give motherfuck
Run up in a nigga house and shoot his grandmother up
What, what, I don't give a motherfuck
Get your baby kidnapped then your baby motherfucked
It's the Carter III bitch better put your supper up
Hollygrove I throw it up like I'm tryna lose my gut
Fuck is up? Beat 'em up like a million uppercuts
Got a million duffled up for the fuck of it shit
Get on my level you can't get on my level
You will need a space shuttle or a ladder thus forever
However I'm better if not now then never
Don't you ever fix your lips unless you 'bout to suck my dick bitch
Swallow my words, taste my thoughts
And if it's too nasty, spit it back at me
Two more inches I'da been in that casket
According to the doctor I could've died in traffic
Bounce right back on them bitches like Magic
Abracadabra I'm up like Viagra
I should do this shit for my +click+ like +Adam Sandler+
I control hip hop and I'ma keep it on my channel
Watch me, bitch watch me, bitch watch me
But they cannot see me like Hitler
It's the New Orleans nightmare
Money so old, it's growing white hair
Young Money baby yeah we right here
I'ma make sure we ball 'til we fall like tears
And Momma don't cry your son can handle his
I got her out the hood, and put up in the hills
Yeah, when I was 14 I told my Mom we would see better days
And sure enough I got Ms. Cita in a better place
When I was 14 I told my Mom we would see better days
And sure enough we did exactly what I say
I tell my girl when you fuck me better fuck me good
'Cause if another girl could she gon fuck me good
No sitting at table if you bringing nothing to it
And I get straight to it like it's nothing to it
Yeah, I got game like Stuart, Scott fresh out the ESPN shop
And when Sportscenter poppin e'rthing stopping
But you can't fool me I know what you watching
ME you watch ME, you watch ME
'Cause I BE Weezy
Must see TV, C3
Nigga that's ME and I'm ME
I'm ME times three
So retreat or suffer defeat
I'm back 3 Peat
C3!
