[Lil Wayne]
Yeah...
I can't trust these niggas, throw some water on 'em
They tell me "Go to Hell", okay I know the owner
Strip clubs gettin' old, all the strippers hoein'
All these bitches think they dimes, watch me flip a coin
Thank you Jesus, my dogs is off the leashes
Had to leave my Spanish bitch cause she was startin' to get suspicious
Tell the beef I mean business, suit and tie nigga
You and all your dogs can get euthanized, nigga
Trigger happy nigga, I just can't stop smilin'
Thank God I'm fly, I had to thank my pilot
You think you're callin' shots, you got the wrong number
I love Benjamin Franklin more than his own mother
Throw that pussy, throw that pussy
And I don't want no throwback pussy, man fuck these pussy, ass niggas
I lay back and ash Swishers, my new shoes is ass kickers
She drink cum like she had hiccups; rest in peace to my last victim
Ahh~! We be passin' blunts, they be passin' judgement
Five blunts of that strong, call that strength in numbers
Uh, AK's with Chiquitas, you shell-shocked like Adidas
Whoever find your body, finders keepers
Yeah, it's that pure Colombia
Cause soon as the bitch tasted it, her tongue was numb
It's loaded, so I just let her jump the gun
It's that "Dedication 5" and another one, I love it!
Tunechi, yeah, free Scooter
I'm out'chea, let's get it

I done lost a couple hoes but I'm still a pimp
This change of face on my Rollie, shout out Lil Kim
Park my cars in front my house like I ain't got no garage
Just lookin' for a bitch to stay down like I'm throwin' knives
Mac so paid we 'bout to start callin' him Macintosh
I really beat that pussy up, them niggas shadowbox
These niggas sendin' threats, I'm a start sendin' hits
Bring me his head so I can make sure it's him
It's lonely at the top, it's lonely at the top
I think I'm 'bout to jump, niggas phony as a prop
Ain't nothin' on me but this chop, turn you and your homies into slop
Put your brains all over the window, people passin' window shop
Like uhh, this that pure Columbia
It's just us, fuck the rest, we got insomnia
Most likely I done fucked that bitch that's layin' under ya
She said she tryin' to see me, bitch that's Stevie Wonderful
You better, mind your business, hitman with a hit list
YMCMB, the world is ours, seconds minutes
I'm a movie motherfucker, camera man, are you gettin' this?
Burnin' blunts like bridges, turn up, missin'
Ahh! We out here with that clean work
These niggas sellin' remix, we got clean work
Kill everybody, y'all gon' need a limousine hearse
You see I'm armed like a fuckin' short sleeve shirt!
D5, what up five? Yeah
