[Lil Twist]
Yep.. {Sonny Digital} yeah, turn up..

Look, I put the kush in the stogey; yeah, I put the Bentley in drive
I'm pullin' out the garage (yeah) and thankin' God I'm alive (uh-huh)
I've been through so much shit, been through trouble and back
I ain't do much time, but dawg I ain't goin' back (no)
These niggas fake and they phony, the paparazzi wait on me (huh)
I left the jail in Givenchy, they should have posted that homie (ha)
I'm in the A with Rich Homie, I'm in the A with 2 Chainz
I'm in the A with my brother, it's YMCM Rich Gang
Now tell them niggas line up, I tell them niggas time up
This KTZ gon' stand out, it's clear I don't give a fuck
In my closet I eat you up, my fashion ill - no duh
My whip game insane, uh, Ferrari Testarossas
Y'all niggas thought I lost it, I'm awesome
I just took a break to teach a young nigga how to boss it like when KG went to Boston
Or when Melo went to the Knicks and he brought JR Smith and they both started ballin'
Big bro went from servin' birds to pelicans in New Orleans
Huh, let me take a break, let me catch my breath
Rollin' with the Birdman homie, it's YM over everything nigga, I don't need nothing else
It's Lil Twist, nigga, I'm checked in; I fucked homegirl and her best friend
You don't wanna miss out on your blessing, got the dope dick, I use it as a weapon
I just

[Chorus: Lil Twist]
Shoot her - BANG; shoot her - BANG
Shoot her - BANG (haha, yeah)
Shoot her - BANG; shoot her - BANG
... (hehe) Shoot her - BANG

[Euro]
Hahah, check
Sometimes I think I'm Michael Jordan, Michael Tyson, Michael Phelps and Michael Jackson
Might just drop my fuckin' tape and fuck around, it might go platinum
How'd I do that off of freebies? Fill my double cup with ether
Got the same buzz as niggas with an album off of features
See I'm doin' it again, got a tool in the timbs, now the rules gotta bend
No tools in the gym but I gotta bring it in because niggas wanna flex, but they really slim Jim
Gotta point it at him, him, fuck it and him, all I wanna do is kill kill for the ching ching
Got a best friend and the best friend got a twin, gotta fit 'em all in, now that's a win win win win
The room's spinnin' cause I'm faded
Watch how you run up on these businessmen, they're gang related
I said I like the way she dance, she like the way I made it
Fuck me without paying the rent, imagine if I paid it
I owe you one girl, I owe you one's, money always been the main attraction
Homie told me women always been the main distraction
And I'm too focused, I just hate to get disturbed
I'm busy makin' millions and she just started laughin' so you know I had to

[Chorus]

[Cory Gunz]
Wantin' manners when I don't even want a mask on
War paint like a baboon and my bitch got a red ass on
Young Money Cash Money to the dirt of me so for certainly I'mma get my blast on
To the face of a fuck nigga tryin' to fuck with us, think they can make it if they can run a decathlon
Stay blazin', I mack on, play brave and get back home with them AK's, crack arms
With a straight face, that calm and I fain gaze and attack on with a straight razor in that palm
Any nigga want it he gotta get it, the yoppa got it rollin' and rockin' with it
I got a nigga showin' and poppin', pickin' and goin', packin' a fight, everybody hit the floor, he shot the men and BOOM~!
Pall bearers, cold moms, militia all Bishop's, O-Dawg's
You should've drove off, hitting on bitches and poor dogs
Lookin' the nose off, lookin' like I'm flickin' the stove off
When I'm kickin' the stove off, kickin' the doors off, everybody hit the deck, still bodies get thrown off
Say makin' a remarkable pay, meetin' grandpa at a doc or a bay
Bad bitch, hide the grippers, I may; fuckin' killin' unbook, come the coppers and spray
Twizzie get the chicken, they plot him hoppin' the gate; if you get to trippin' then you get shot in the face
You ain't got the bitch in the kitchen poppin' the safe, sorry to say, no eye witness, you finish you gotta bang

[Chorus]
