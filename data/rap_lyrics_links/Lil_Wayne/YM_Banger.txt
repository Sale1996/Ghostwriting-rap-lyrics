[Gudda Gudda]
Ok I'm leanin to the left, fla-flag in my right pocket
Star Trak fly, unidentified flying objects
Extraterrestrial, I'm all about my decimals
Retarded in the booth they say I got a special flow
Sicker than your average you rappers is ass backwards
Gudda spit crack and you niggaz is crack addicts
The simple mathematics; you cut the check
and I rake in the green like I'm rakin the grass in
Pretty bitches damn near faint when they passin
Call my whip Martin but the first name Aston
Potatohead niggaz get mashed when I'm spazzin
Think you fuckin with me? Put your cash in
Nah, I doubt it; I was young and reckless
when Pete say he was about it
You niggaz is +Ducks+, +Howards+
Cowards, kill the competition and shower niggaz with flowers
This rap shit is ours, punk, bitch~!

[Lil Wayne]
Uh, Uptown back in it, Hollygrove black menace
Black clothes, black tennis', black semi'
I've never sat in the Hemi that will offend me
Try Maybach or Maybach, bitch I got stacks - yeah
Paychecks on paychecks and I still want payback
I still don't play that, I kill on ASAP
And he don't do shit but get money all day
Put some shoes on my bullets now they runnin your way
YM, Young Mula, Young Money all day
Where the drugs so sweet like honey on yay
Which one of y'all say you want drama? I'm honored
I blitz yo' ass like a motherfuckin lineman
Stack of paychecks with a whole bunch of comma
Still wear red like an old 49er
Fuck shittin on ya, dump the whole toilet on ya
Wee-Weezy F baby, bitch I'm hotter than Uganda
Unngh!

[Jae Millz]
Let-let go
Mo-momma ain't make me to make homies she made me to make history
So doin that my extra-curicular activity
Bulldozer boy and my target is the industry
Two things in the world I love - good head and victory
You ain't doin it big, I'm grown, stop kiddin me
Your whip ain't up to date and your hoes look like Mr. T
This is +Misery+, no Kathy Bates
Come at me sideways my money'll slap you straight
Yeah, I'm a big joker so you know I'll smash your ace
Leave the club with ya girl send her home with a ashy face
Love is a gamble, but it's my casino
And tonight you're the loser, I hope she got Aveno
I hope the game got life insurance cause I'ma kill it
And all you whack ass rap niggaz dyin with it
I'm so Harlem, eatin but still starvin
Po-pockets fat as fuck like all they do is eat margarine
Millz!

[Tyga]
Say, put the flow in the pot, crank up the notch
Burn the song from a stove top, this finger lickin hot
His pick flip cause the nigga flopped
My shit hit like the pitch was soft, niggaz cottonballed
She dropped drawers cause she poppin off
Her pussy crossed guard but, I don't stop at all
I smash in the car, like fuck the fuckin law
Her baby daddy gone, who wanna meet the Don?
That Rocky shit up on the arm-arm
Shittin on 'em like hay in the barn
Hey wait they say Money talks and, man you don't speak at all
You shop at mini-malls
My style two thumbs up like using analogs
Ha ha~! I wreck shit for the recognition bitch
Jesus as my witness, Saan vision
Eyeball you niggaz, flame flicker
I melt pictures, Tyga skin ain't drippin
