(*"Pay attention!"*)

[Nicki Minaj]
SB (*"Holiday season NIGGUH"*)
I think it's my time
You know why?
My tears have dried
And I know that no weapon formed against me will prosper
(*"We make it look easy"*)
And I truly believe that my haters, are my motivators
Young Money (*"HOLIDAY SEASON!"*)

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
If you could you would get rid of me
Fuck you gon' do when a bitch try to go hard?
But I won't let you get to me (to me)
You should already figure I'ma go hard
If you was as real as me
You would never let another girl sit in your throne
I done put the choke on
Now they screamin "Nicki leave me alone!"

[Nicki Minaj]
I am, I'm still, the one to beat
Ain't in a rush from these streets - I am the streets!!
I am gettin it in until the end
I gotta go (GO) go (GO) goooooo GO HARD!

Carter called, lemme get the car key
You don't want it with the Harajuku Barbie
Keep a marquis, everything sparkly
(M-man man down!) Hit 'em on the walkie-talkie
Hit em, hit 'em knock-knock, tell 'em let me in
My name ring bells bitch buzz me in
And I only stop for pedestrians
Or a real real bad lesbian
Hit 'em with the Mac, hit 'em with the tec 9
Hit 'em with the Ruger by the intersex sign
Hit 'em with a Tommy so my niggaz call me Pammy
And I always the jammy in the trunk or in the Lamby
Put my whole borrough on my back and I'm good-a
I don't wanna hear what you would or what you coulda
I represent all the girls that stood up
Used to drink water with a little bit of sugar
Now I'm in the gym with my squats and my sit-ups
Doin the scissor-leg on the mat with my foot up
Young black pin-up, all of my bitches did up
Now I'm tellin L.A. Reid to step his bid up
And I'm tellin President Carter he picked a winner
Bitches like Nelly and Kelly got a "Dilemma"
These birds all fly South in the winter
Fuck I look like chompin on a chicken dinner?
You can hate me, but why knock my hustle?
I'ma be the queen no matter how they shuffle
Skirts with the ruffle, Louis on the duffle
I'm a bad bitch no muzzle (no muzzle)

Bitches is softer than Al Dente, cut from a different Kinte
Tell 'em I'm the ninja, Weezy is my sensei
So I call him Splinter, faster than a sprinter
Gimme my chopsticks I'll have these rap bitches for dinner
This is for my gentlemen in button-ups and khakis
This is for my nigga 7-Up in Coxsackie
This is for my niggaz wheelyin them Kawasakis
Shout out to the back East, salt fish aggies
Kisses to my fans unless I'm feelin kinda cocky
Winter wonderland is on my hand it's kinda rocky
I am Nicki, Minaj or Lewinski
Pumps on the clutch, right hand on the six-speed
Write my own raps I gotta go I gotta get me (gotta get me)

[Chorus]

[Nicki Minaj]
I am, I'm will, I gots to win
I'm still lookin around for my, compe-ti-tion
I am gettin it in until the end
I gotta go (GO) go (GO) goooooo GO HARD!

[Lil Wayne]
From slap-and-cry you start to die so I must go harder
Gotta make these bitches know me just like Bobby know water
Better yet like Bubba know shrimp
But he don't say shit when the gun on his lip
And I don't say shit put the gun on my hip
So I don't say shit but the gun on my hip
If you don't wanna drown don't come on my ship
Check out how them bitches just run on my dick
And me, I'm that nasty son of a bitch
I still got that bitch cum on my lips
If ye ain't got money don't come on my strip
And if you got money, don't come on my strip
I wear that metal, no Olympic
But I can still make you tumble and flip
You fuckin with me if you fuckin with Nic'
They ain't fuckin with me, they ain't fuckin with Nic'
Your girlfriend her decision is split
Cause she wanna fuck me and she wanna fuck Nic'
They wonder if he be fuckin Nic'
As long as she be fuckin rich
That's why I keep my luggage cause
I swear y'alls a fuckin trip~!!
Young Money dungeon bitch
My swagger just punch a bitch
And I shoot like I'm from overseas
So call my gun "Gunovich"
Weezy F. Baby and the "F" is for a bunch of shit
Red drank, blue pill, white dust
Yes I love my country biiiiitch
Ah-ahh, ahhhhhhh!
Yeahh {*echoes*} guitar

{*lengthy guitar solo follows*}

(*"HOLIDAY SEASON!"*)

[Chorus]

[Nicki Minaj]
I am, I'm will, I gots to win
I'm still lookin around for my, compe-ti-tion
I am gettin it in until the end
I gotta go (GO) go (GO) goooooo GO HARD!
