[Lil Wayne]
Nigga I be hard on a hoe cause a bitch ain't shit
And every hoe I done fucked done sucked my dick
I had to pour out some drank for niggas I miss
I hope my weed ain't too loud to hear the snakes hiss
It's "Dedication 5", medication high
I got to clean up after these niggas cause they be wastin' time
And boy my hoes don't get in line because they stay in line
I'm shinin' on these hoes so hard, they gettin' tan lines
It's Tunechi, I go hard, I put in work
Twin Glocks, the gift and the curse
Dirty money, no footprints in dirt
We geeked up, +The Revenge of the Nerds+
I swear, play with these niggas, that's that shit I don't do
As long as money talks, I got someone to talk to
Watch my dogs treat the beef like dog food
I got the power but a short fuse, let's go
I can't trust my iPhone, I think Siri the feds
You know snitches get stitches nigga, needle and thread
You better walk it like you talk it or we cut off your legs
Pretty please don't kill my vibe, I ain't too proud to beg
Alright, fuckin' right, shoot you up at the light
Straight take all yo possessions, call that shit poltergeist
And my homie he a sniper, we call him Wesley Snipes
I call my bitch Plain Jane cause she catch nut like a flight
I'm on a mission to get movie money, stick to the script
Your bitch leakin' information, I just follow the drip
Soon as I get that coupe, I'ma go get the rims
Toss the keys to my homie, tell that nigga it's his
I feel like He-Man when I'm in your hoe
You tell that bitch give me my space like a telescope
In her throat like Ricola, my system solar
I'm too young to die sober, your man a cobra, watch that nigga, let's go
Boy, my bitches got bitches badder than your bitches
But I can't trust none of them bitches though, like magicians
Straight blowin' money fast, I'ma get a ticket
Soon as I get off paper I'ma smack a nigga!
No broken mirrors, I can't see myself broke
Right back pocket flag redder than a velvet rope
Never say never, she might do her friend, you never know
Shorty make that dick stand up like it's tellin' jokes
Uhh, I swear to God, I put in work
I'm on them shrooms, my goons on alert
I spit these bars, this a universe
You better duck, like Dooney and Bourke
I'm tellin' you, shoutout Turk, it's Hot Boys, bitch +Tha Block Is Hot+
If I ain't have the keys to success, I would have picked the lock
Diarrhea shit don't stop until my fuckin' casket drop
Still got that crack, maybe one day I'ma pass the rock
Tunechi, "Dedication 5", whattup five?
