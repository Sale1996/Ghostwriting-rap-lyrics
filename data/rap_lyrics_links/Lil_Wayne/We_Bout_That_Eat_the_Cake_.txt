[Intro: DJ Khaled]
YMCMB, Cash Money Billionaires
More cake. more money, more hustle
We the business, Rich Forever

[Verse 1: Bow Wow]
Smoking kush in my condo
Ballin hard, bitch you ain't know?
Retro 6?s new show laces
At K.O.D. throwin ones in strippers faces
Yeah that Ciroc justr got me feeling good
You are stuntin who? boy I know you wish you could
Cash Money, Young Money
I got retarded paper, I'm talkin dumb money
Tatted up is an Ohio thing
I ain't Tity Boi but IUm rockin 2 Chainz
Pour it up, go head and roll it up
Walking out the club, drunk as fuck

[Chorus x2: Bow Wow]
Hey, stuntin hard yeah we bout that
You say you getting money huh? well I doubt that
All I do is ball, errday
Throwin cake in a niggaz face, eat it anyway

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
... GB on that drink heavy
I run in your fuckin mouth like the tooth fairy
Yeah bitch it's Tune, I'm dope in a spoon
I drive a fast car, that bitch go puu..
What the business is? All my girls pretty
Pussy, money, weed keep the world spinnin
I ball out like the 9th inning World Series
In name of the Father, Son, the Holy Spirit
And the weed strong, like a pro wrestler
What my pockets on? Nutty Professor
Hit the strip club, throw like 20 racks
I ain't trippin baby, I'm gonna get it back
I'm Young Money

[Chorus: x2]
Hey, stuntin hard yeah we bout that
You say you getting money huh? well I doubt that
All I do is ball, errday
Throwin cake in a niggaz face, eat it anyway

[Verse 3: Bow Wow]
I'm on one, yeah I'm hot now
Tell them hatin ass niggaz pi, pipe down
Doing a buck twenty on the highway
Thick red bone looking like Beyonce
Do it for the O, I gotta represent
I hear them clowns talkin stupid they ain't talkin sense
I got my mind on my money
Don't no how to Dougie, but all the bitches love me

[Chorus: x2]
Hey, stuntin hard yeah we bout that
You say you getting money huh? well I doubt that
All I do is ball, errday
Throwin cake in a niggaz face, eat it anyway

[Bridge x4: Bow Wow]
I told ya'll before, nobody can't touch us
Y.M.C.M.B. (unfuckable)

[Chorus: x2]
Hey, stuntin hard yeah we bout that
You say you getting money huh? well I doubt that
All I do is ball, errday
Throwin cake in a niggaz face, eat it anyway
