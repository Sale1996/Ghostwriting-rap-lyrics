Tongue like anaconda, lips like Angelina
Ooh, B is for Bianca, she was a ballerina

Introduced me to Diana, fucked Diana with Chiquita
So D is for Diana, Diana like it deeper
So I get in her stomach like Mylanta at my leisure

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
And these are my bitches, my alphabet bitches
Yeah, these are my bitches, my alphabet, bitches
These are my bitches, my alphabet bitches
Oh, these are my bitches, my alphabet.. bitches
