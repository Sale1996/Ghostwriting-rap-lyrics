[Nicki Minaj - doesn't SOUND like her though]
I'm in the collard green 6, cornbread in the guts
Got the Halloween kicks, trick or treatin the clutch
C'mon nigga, is you trickin or what?
Flow, fl-flow tighter than a dick in the butt
Just hopped off the plane, came back from Vancouv'
Little white T, some boobs, and bamboo
White girls tell me "Hey Nicky, your camp rules
Is that why you get more head than shampoos?"
Asalaam alaikum, no oink for me
And I never let a d-boy boink for free
Cause it's Barbie bitch, you can join the wave
I've been penny nickel dimed, I done coined the phrase, ha!
You couldn't beat me there if you had a Leer
Indian-style, courtside with a cavalier
V.I.P. roses, you can have a beer
Cause honey when you gettin money you don't have a care

[Chorus]
Now r-roger that, r-r-roger that
R-roger that, r-r-r-roger that
R-roger that, r-r-roger that
R-R-R-R-R, ROGER

[Tyga]
Young black Ricos, kill for the C-notes
But me though, I Jackson bitch uhh, Tito
She wanna play games but, this is not bingo
Monopoly I'm past go, go on ahead and deep-throat
Fo' chick fo'somes, skin color's mocha
Sally and Sonia put the pussies on my totem
pole, what stroke 'em uhh, strike ya like bowlin
Now open like you yawnin, at 6 in the mornin
Slee-sleepin on me probably in a coffin
I'm hotter than the end of fuckin' August, I'm awesome
I'm awesome; repeat it to ya grandma, and uncles
or mothers, Tyga's no dad but I'm the muh'fucker
Muh'fuckers, this the last supper
Look, no hands, I'ma bread cuffer
I don't dare lover, I'ma dare devil
I don't fear nuttin, muh'fucker, Young Money!

[Chorus]
Now roger that, Roger that
Ro-Roger that, Roger that
Fuck around and never get Roger back
Ha ha ha..

[Lil Wayne]
I'm goin' in!
Fresh off the jet, sharper than Gillette
The blunt still wet, so pass it like Brett
We sip side of mug, we call it upset
Smoke more than fo' quarters, we call it sudden debt
I'm a beast.. you a pet
AK long neck.. Keith Sweat, haha!
Weezy motherfucker, Capo in this bitch with me
Money talks and have a convo in this bitch with me
I'm mountain high Colorado and this bitch with me
Flow crazy 7:30, you just 6:50
Twenty bullets from the chopper take the roof off
Laughin to the bank, I'm a goofball
Hahaha! It's YM
And we at your neck, like a violin
It's our world, we make it spin
And y'all the prey.. amen!

[Outro]
Now roger that, Roger that
Where Roger at? I heard Rog' a rat
Fuc-fuck around and never get Roger back!!
HAHAHAHA..
