[Intro: N.O.R.E.]
Fresh pack of bogamills (Yes sir!) 
Empty bottle ass taker, empty bottles of Nuvo
Only one problem is

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Uh! Bitch tried to kiss me out the head, fuck wrong wit' yo' head?!
She tried to kissed me out the head, fuck wrong wit' yo' head?!
She tried to kissed me out the head, fuck wrong wit' yo' head?!
She tried to kissed me out the head, I kicked her out of my head

[Verse One: N.O.R.E.]
Ok we left the club around three, headed back to that room
Yeah it's time for that dome 'cause we checkin out 'round noon
She said damn N.O.R.E. so cold keep it up always no doze
Look at that ass shorty all swole, we can just go! go! go! go!
How 'bout some backshots? Do it missionary
Whip out my laptop, pulled out my dictionary
Hmmm! And I got head right off the whip
This she came up out my lips, I'm like bitch what part is this?!

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Bitch tried to kiss me out the head, fuck wrong wit' yo' head?!
She tried to kissed me out the head, fuck wrong wit' yo' head?!
She tried to kissed me out the head, fuck wrong wit' yo' head?!
She tried to kissed me out the head, I kicked her out of my head

[Verse Two: N.O.R.E.]
Still gettin head all in that whip, without crashin that shit
You see me passin some Cris, you know I'm stashin that bitch
Now listen, last night I had a new hoe with a molly on and a Nuvo
She want to leave 'em I too though, she was on the +Dee+ you know +Kool Moe+
+Freaks Come Out At Night+ I see she 'bout that life
Feed that bitch that pipe, skeet skeet like more than twice
I'm gettin head like once again
Then she came up out my lips, that's one part I'm just not with

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Bitch tried to kiss me out the head, fuck wrong wit' yo' head?!
She tried to kissed me out the head, fuck wrong wit' yo' head?!
She tried to kissed me out the head, fuck wrong wit' yo' head?!
She tried to kissed me out the head, I kicked her out of my head

[Bridge: N.O.R.E.]
I-I had to tell I had to tell I had to tell her man!
I said baby girl, mamita senorita!
We could've did what we did when we, we're supposed to do
But after you did what you did, ewwwwwwwwwww!!!!!

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Bitch tried to kiss me out the head, fuck wrong wit' yo' head?!
She tried to kissed me out the head, fuck wrong wit' yo' head?!
She tried to kissed me out the head, fuck wrong wit' yo' head?!
She tried to kissed me out the head, I kicked her out of my head

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Yeah! She tried to kiss me out the head, fuck wrong wit' yo' head?!
BITCH! You must have bumped yo' shit when you fell out my bed
