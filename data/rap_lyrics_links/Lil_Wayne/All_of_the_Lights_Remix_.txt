{Lil Wayne flickers lighter}
 
(Liiiiights, liiiights - All of the lights!)
 
[Lil Wayne]
Lights on, I see your face
She eat me up, she got expensive taste
I see you dreamin, but you still awake
Big slices, that's how you cut the cake
It's cold as hell, I show and tell
Weezy home, our nigga outta jail!
In this give or take world I got what it takes
Put you out your misery -- Kathy Bates
I'm Young Money, I'm Cash Money
If we could buy time, I'd spend my last money
Now I'm spendin time, you in the blind
This little light of mine, I'ma let it shine
(ALL OF THE LIGHTS)
Bright lights, night lights, headlights 
SHH! No lights, but them infra-red lights
Yeah, long life, don't like to ask twice
You killin me baby, this the past life
 
[Chorus: Rihanna]
(ALL OF THE LIGHTS)
Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights
 
[Big Sean]
Okay now, ready, set, go, go, go, go
Go-go 'til you can't go no mo'
I'm ill times ill, dope plus dope
"Westside bitch~!" Quote/unquote
Whoa there boy, don't go there hoe
If you cross that line I might overload
I swear these lights-lights-LIGHTS be talkin to me
but I can't read Morse Code
Why every rapper name Big got bodied, huuuh?
But every rapper name Sean got money, oooooohh
Well, I guess my chances are 50/50
But my vision is 20/20, so I'll be countin a hundred hundreds'
(ALL OF THE LIGHTS)
Like oh, my Allah, Lordy Lordy Lordy
I took yo' chick, now you want beef 
and I am just chucklin like I'm Porky
'Cause you spend all day with her spoonin (What?)
Just spent all night with her forkin
There's a one-way ticket to Hell and
they want these bullets to book it for me, man
I'm shittin on every statistic that said I'd be dead or fuckin broke
This is history, your kids' kids' kids' kids' kids gon' book report me
Whaaaat, whaaaat -- and I think they want to murder me
I'm shinin hard, 'cause bitch I'm an emergency!
 
[Chorus]
 
[Big Sean talking over Chorus] 
B-I-Good-G
I do it... Yeah!
 
[Alicia Keys] (Elton John)
Ooh-whoa-ooh-whoooooooa, ooh-whoa-ooh-whooooooooa-ohh
(I tried to tell you but all I can say is ohhh-oh)
Ooh-whoa-ooh-whoooooooa, ooh-whoa-ooh-whooooooooa-ohh
[Big Sean singing over Keys' and John part]
You know a nigga so good, so goooood 
Westside, so hood
I do it..
 
[Drake]
Uh! Bad decisions, good intentions, man I'm ridin, Weezy with me 
I just stepped out of the strip club, made $5,000 look like $50
I spend all my time in Houston, smoke that kush, but I don't do Whitney
I don't do Britney, I don't do Lindsay, I made two million since last Wednesday
And I HATE y'all! Y'all got too much free time
Sayin I ain't drop shit, everything'll be fine
Worryin 'bout yo' old girl, tryna see if she's mine
Nigga, she's with me when she tells you she needs some "me" time
It's our time, so FUCK y'all~!
I'm really 'bout to go Spring Break now, start takin shots in this muh'fucker
And you ain't really have all that ass last month girl
What, you get some shots in that muh'fucker?
Yeah, we got the Roc in this muh'fucker
You thought niggaz was goin pop in this muh'fucker?
Uh, Young +Money, Power, Respect+ in this bitch
You would think we got The Lox in this muh'fuckeeeer!
I made mistakes, I made some bread
I even made a way for them to get ahead
To my surprise, nobody replacin me
"Take Care" and "Carter IV," it won't be long 'til they can see the LIGHTS!
(Lights on, turn the lights on)  
And I'm on one, I got one
You a pussy nigga, I'm not one
So call it a night, call it a night
(Lights on, turn the lights on)  
And I run this, y'all know that
I take the purple and po' that
All in the Sprite, all in the Sprite, hahaha! 
 
[Kid Cudi] (Drake)
Gettin miiiiiiiiiine, baby (Yeah!)
Gotta let these niggaz knooooooow, yeah 
(Shout out to my nigga Cudi, too! That's my motherfuckin nigga f'real)
Get it riiiiiiiiiight, ay
You should go and get your own, yeah
(Shout out to Cole!) 
(Nigga got a buzz now, fuck y'all niggaz, man I'm HERE!)
 
[Fergie]
This time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time
Time-time-time-time-We're goin all the way this time
Time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time
Time-time-time-time-We're goin all the way this time
(ALL OF THE LIGHTS)
Time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time
Time-time-time-time-We're goin all the way this time
Time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time-time
Time-time-time-time-We're goin all the way this time
(ALL OF THE LIGHTS)
