[Intro - Madonna] 
My love's a revolver 
My love's a revolver 

[Verse 1 - Madonna] 
Oops I guess I shot ya 
My finger's on the trigger 
I had a bullet with your name on it 
Click click 
I'm a sex pistol 
My love should be illegal 
Real deal baby 
I'm no counterfeit 
Click click 

[Hook - Madonna] 
Line 'em up 
Knock 'em down 
If looks can kill 
Ay oh ay oh 
My body's fully loaded 
And I got more ammo 
Line 'em up 
Knock 'em down 
If looks can kill 
Ay oh ay oh 
You're an accessory to murder cause 

[Chorus - Madonna] 
My love's a revolver 
My sex is a killer 
Do you wanna die happy? 
Do you wanna die happy? 
My love's a revolver 
My sex is a killer 
Do you wanna die happy? 
Do you wanna die happy? 
I let it bang bang 

[Verse 2 - Madonna] 
You've been hit by a smooth criminal 
A bad girl I gotcha crying to your mama 
Saying I can't believe it 
I've seen your type 
Bring a knife into a gun fight 
Caught up in the law right 
I think I'm in love right 

[Hook - Madonna] 
Line 'em up 
Knock 'em down 
If looks can kill 
Ay oh ay oh 
If body's fully loaded 
And I got more ammo 
Line 'em up 
Knock 'em down 
If looks can kill 
Ay oh ay oh 
You're an accessory to murder cause 

[Chorus - Madonna] 
My love's a revolver 
My sex is a killer 
Do you wanna die happy? 
Do you wanna die happy? 
My love's a revolver 
My sex is a killer 
Do you wanna die happy? 
Do you wanna die happy? 
I let it bang bang 

[Verse 3 - Madonna] 
I shoot 'em bang bang 
I shoot 'em bang bang 
Mirror mirror on the wall 
Who's the baddest of them all? 
I shoot 'em bang bang 
I shoot 'em bang bang 
I line them up and watch them fall 

[Verse 4 - Lil Wayne] 
Bang 
The shooter name is Wayne 
The victim didn't complain 
She just screamed 'shoot again' 
I gave her extra rounds 
My barrel twist around 
I am Mr. Shoot 'Em Down 
I leave hearts on the ground 
My love is a weapon 
And yes I use it well 
Then I let the rose petals 
Cover up the bullet shell 
I never shoot and tell 
I only shoot to kill 
And that vest ain't gonna help ya 
Even if it's made of steel 

[Chorus - Madonna & Lil Wayne] 
My love's a revolver 
My sex is a killer 
Do you wanna die happy? 
Do you wanna die happy? 
My love's a revolver 
My sex is a killer 
Do you wanna die happy? 
Do you wanna die happy? 
My love's a revolver 
My sex is a killer 
Do you wanna die happy? 
Do you wanna die happy? 
My love's a revolver 
My sex is a killer 
Do you wanna die happy? 
Do you wanna die happy? 
I let it bang bang 
I shoot 'em bang bang 
I shoot 'em bang bang 
I line up and watch them fall 
I shoot 'em bang bang 
I shoot 'em bang bang 
I line up and watch them fall 

[Outro - Lil Wayne] 
Do you wanna die happy? 
Do you wanna die happy?
