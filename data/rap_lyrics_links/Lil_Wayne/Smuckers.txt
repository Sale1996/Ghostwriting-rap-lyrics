[Chorus: Tyler, the Creator]
For your boy
I'm watchin' "Freaks and Geeks" with the trampoline on the floor
I'm tryna cop the new McLaren with the vertical doors, nigga

[Tyler, the Creator]
Money, money, money, money, money ain't the motive, what's your name again? Nobody knows it
Don't speak to me nigga, you not important~!
I'm focused~!! ("Two, three, four") Bring in the horns

They say I'm nutty, a picnic basket, I'm short of a sandwich
I'm peanut butter, Boyce Watkin's a faggot, please come and get me
Said I'll suck him at your neck, like a hickey, boy I'm sicky
Like a HIV victim, ain't nobody fuckin with me
I got, banned from New Zealand, Whitey called me a demon (yeah)
And a terrorist, goddammit, I couldn't believe it
Ban a kid from a country, I never fall, never timber
But you fucked up as a parent, your child idol's a nigger~!
I clearly don't give a FUCK so you could run that shit BACK
And FUCK your loud pack and FUCK your Snapchat (man)
"Cherry Bomb" the greatest fuckin' album since the days of sound
And that shit gon' pop just like that nigga that was never 'round
Damn, 'bout to drop, gas 'em up, thick exhaust
Young T, came quick, hard to beat, dick is soft
We ain't lyin', we the truth, call him Simba, beats his hooves
Tyler, the Creator sweatin' Jesus juice
Put that fuckin' cow on my level cause I'm raisin' the stakes
Mom I made you a promise, it's no more section 8
And what we ate was the steaks now our section is great
Cause that's the level I'm at, my niggas pass 'em a plate~!
'YE~!!

[Kanye West]
Why, oh why, why, why don't they like me?
Cause Nike gave lot of niggas checks but I'm the only nigga to ever check Nike

Richer than white people with black kids
Scarier than black people with ideas
Nobody can tell me where I'm headin'
But I feel like Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen at my wedding
They say I'm crazy but that's the best thing goin for me
You can't +Lynch+ +Marshawn+ if Tom Brady throwin' to me
I made a million mistakes but I'm successful in spite of 'em
I believe you like a fat trainer takin' a bite or somethin'
I wanna turn the tanks to playgrounds
I dream't of 2Pac, he asked me +"R U Still Down?"+
"Yeah my nigga", it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on
I know they told their white daughters don't bring home Jerome
I am the free nigga archetype
I am the light and the beacon, you can ask the deacon
It's funny when you get extra money
Every joke you tell just be extra funny
I mean you can even dress extra bummy
Cocaine bathroom break, nose extra runny
And I gave you all I got, you still want extra from me
Oxford want a full blown lecture from me
And the Lexus pull up, err, like hop, I hopped out like "wassup?"
Err-err-err, step back, hold up, my nigga you suck, hold up
SKRRRT~! ... {*car revving*}
I studied the proportions
Emotions runnin' at an Autobahn speed level
Had a drink with fear and I was textin' God
He said "I gave you a big dick so go extra hard"

[Chorus: Tyler, the Creator]
For your boy
I'm tryna pop the new McLaren with the vertical doors
I'm watchin' "Freaks and Geeks", got a trampoline in my room, damn

[Tyler, the Creator]
("Two, three, four") Hold your fuckin horses
Niggas really fuckin thought that T lost it
Like I bet it at a auction, been exhausted
I been workin' while y'all cylinders smoke like broken exhaust tips
Fuckin' losers

[Lil Wayne]
Hold your fuckin' ponies my homie
I whip your donkey by my lonely, I eat pussy like Shoni's
Yeah, it's Tunechi homie, master of ceremonies
I knock 'em down, +Domino+ effect, no pepperoni
I swear

[Tyler, the Creator] + (Lil Wayne)
This them Golf Boys like them Hot Boys
For the '9-9 and 2000, but it's the two thou'
And the '1-4 and the '1-5
Yo whattup Wayne? (Whattup slime? Nigga go hard)
Yeah, I'ma go hard like before came, got too much drive, need like ten lanes
Life is a broad and she give brain
That's that road head (yeah) that's a dream car
Got a full tank of that same year I was born
That's that '1-9-9-1, 'nother nigga like I, you won't find one
Cause nigga I'm a GOD, a divine one - Tune

[Lil Wayne]
My trigger finger wise but my nine dumb
Middle finger blind so it's fuck A-N-Y one
Fuck, skate and die son, a hundred ways to die son
I'm starin' at a trampoline/tramp on lean, made my eye jump
Use Adderall like alarm clocks, wake my high up
Steaks/stakes are high, well done and prime cut, eat up
I stick my Rollie in her mouth, let the time cum
She got hair like Sheneneh and eyes like Wanda, oh my goodness

[Tyler, the Creator]
Wayne, them bitches ugly, these niggas colder than Tommy buddy
'Ye, we hittin' models like Tony Parker be hittin' bottles
Bitch I'm goin' harder than yellow cabby stoppin' for Lionel (black ass nigga)
They be duckin' us niggas, shout out to Donald Sterling
Boy let's get a scrimmage, I'll cut some niggas
I'll bring the Clippers and a couple owners that's kinda German
You bring the nooses and a couple trees where the money grow and get bodies burnin'
Cause I'm tryna +Hang+ like I'm +Mr. Cooper+ or Jews in Berlin
Or some niggas from Alabama, Birmingham
I need musics all over the street like Erick Sermon
was, fuck us, maybe we should team up
Anti Golf Boys cause I don't fuck with me either
I'm a liar, I'm a faggot (uh)

[Lil Wayne]
Son you need Jesus
But I heard he left sunset, to go on tour with Yeezus
Well, I'm prayin' for the new Yeezys
And you pussies prayin' that we squash the beef like zucchinis
I know, it ain't gain nor fame nor tame
Or lame nor strange

[Tyler] Nah faggot, it's Golf - Wang
