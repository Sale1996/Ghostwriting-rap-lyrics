[Paparue]
Original roughnecks, hear {laughing}
Check!

(Chorus 2x)
Nobody burn them blocks like-a we
Nobody bust them heads like-a we
Nobody could outshine we
Tha whole CMR, CMR family

[Lil' Wayne]
Look, it's little rhymecholy
Legendary like Bob Marley
17 ward superstar, feel me
I tell ya, shorty million dollar, nigga
Don't test, 'cause lil' shorty is a rider, nigga
Got my click behind me.. every step of tha way
Hit your wards, with tha pump, with your chest and your face
I'm a bloodhound... I ain't lyin', I'm thugged out!
I'm from uptown... and that ain't no Beverly Hills
You wan' know what that be like?  Well, curiousity kills
Send chills up my trigga finger, blast tha dummy
'Specially if it's a drought, I got ta have tha money
Take tha hit, even if it's below tha average money
Got to make it through tha week, and feed my family uppy
I'm just a lil' thug, what
Belt-buckle fall down to my cuffs, what
And police don't even matter, they can suck what
Tha price right if I catch ya slippin', nigga, what what.. what

(Chorus)
Nobody burn them blocks like-a we (nawww)
Nobody bust them heads like-a we (hmmmm)
Nobody could outshin we
Tha whole CMR, CMR family ([Baby]What!) ([Pap.] For real!)

([Baby]What! What!)Nobody burn them blocks like-a we ([Pap.] nawww)
Nobody bust them heads like-a we ([Baby] Say it, say it) ([Pap.] hmmmm)
Nobody could outshine we
Tha whole CMR, CMR family (For real!!)

[Mannie Fresh]
Eeh, what, what
What, you got a (?), 'cause of tha threats that you sendin' me?
Lil' boy, I got so much money, I know who killed Kennedy
I hear you tellin' people 'bout tha people you done
But look, everytime I brought me to ya, you all about fun
What made you bring a knife to a gun fight... now that's not right!
Why your bitch-ass even showed up tonight?
Nigga, we use ta kick it like Tai Bo
I don't know.. what made you go sideshow, turn jive whore
Kickin', trifling, dirty, and low
We use ta split chicken.. ride ta Texas and back
I drive tha rental car while you drive tha Cadillac
Shakin' like a pair of hot dice
Doin' 55, duckin' feds, law enforcement, and police
Niggas turn like fake gold.. sell they soul
Treat'cha like Chicago in tha winter:  ice cold!
9-karat 44's, and Calicos
Keep a clean nose
And tight Teflon bullet-proof clothes

(Chorus)
Nobody burn them blocks like-a we ([B.G.] What? What?)
Nobody bust (Stop!) them heads like-a we (What? What?)
Nobody could (Stop!) outshine (Stop!) we (What?)
Tha whole CMR (What?), CMR (What?) family (What?) ([Pap.] Uh-huhh!)

Nobody burn them blocks (Stop!) like-a we (Stop!) ([Pap.] nawww) ([B.G.] 
What? What?)
Nobody bust them heads (Stop!) like-a we (Stop!) ([Pap.] hmmmm) ([B.G.] 
What? What?)
Nobody could (Stop!) outshine (Stop!) we (What?)
Tha whole CMR (What?), CMR (Stop!) family (Stop!) ([Pap.] For real!!)

[Baby]
Nigga outta line, get smoked
I don't kidd, or joke
Fuckin' with my B.G., off top I'm goin' broke
I don't play with these niggas
I get.. low down and dirty
And have niggas' brains coverin' tha ground
I'm tha number-one stunter, you don't want my trouble
I'll have four niggas in your hood in my hummer
I'm from back in tha game, but ain't a damn thing change

[B.G.]
Ya get a whole thing for ten, nigga, tha price tha same

[Baby]
My money long, but it don't run with tha airport
I just bought a Hotel Cash Money Resort
Hos love my grill, hos love my crib

[B.G.]
These hos just love tha way that.. Baby live

[Baby]
But I'm a thug-ass nigga, arms full of some taps
Got a Cash Money Millionaires 'cross my back
You don't want funk with me.. I don't think you do, nigga

[B.G.]
We'll put ten-a-piece on your whole crew

[Baby]
What!

(Chorus 4x)
{fading out begins in 4th}
