[Lil Wayne]
(Yeahh)... Doin a buck in the latest drop
I got stopped by a lady cop
Ha Ha... she got me thinking I can date a cop
Ha Ha... cause her uniform pants are so tight
She read me my rights
She put me in nah car, she cut off all the lights
She said I had the right to remain silent
Now I got her hollering sounding like a siren
Talkin' bout...
Wee Ooh Wee Ooh Wee (Yea)
Wee Ooh Wee Ooh Wee (Yea)
Wee Ooh Wee Ooh Wee (Yea)
And I know she the law, and she know I'm the boss
And she know I get high a-bove the law
And she know I'm raw, she know it from the street
And all she want me to do is fuck the police
Talkin' bout...
Wee Ooh Wee Ooh Wee
Wee Ooh Wee Ooh Wee (Yea)
Wee Ooh Wee Ooh Wee... (Yea)

[Chorus: Bobby Valentino]
When I get up all in ya
We can hear the angels calling us (Yeahh)
We can see the sunrise before us (Umm)
And when I'm in that thang, I'll make that body sang
I make it say...
Wee Ooh Wee Ooh Wee

Ha Ha... And after we got done
I said lady what's ya number she said 911
Haaa... emergency only
Head doctor perform surgery on me
Yeahh... and now I'm healed
I make her wear nothing but handcuffs & heels
And I beat it like a cop
Rodney King baby yeah I beat it like a cop
Ha Haaa... beat it like a cop
Rodney King baby said beat it like a cop
But I ain't tryna be violent
But I'll do the time but her love is timeless
... Mrs. Officer...
I know you wish ya name was Mrs. Carter huh?
Wee Ooh Wee Ooh Wee
Wee Ooh Wee Ooh Wee (Yeah)
Wee Ooh Wee Ooh Wee, Like a cop car...

[Chorus: Bobby Valentino]
When I get up all in ya

[Bobby Valentino]
Mrs. Officer, Mrs. Officer
Tell your lieutenant get them cuffs off of ya
I'm kid kid... my face on every wanted poster
I'm wanted by every lady cop all over
That ass so big I catch a battery to hold ya
My hands so big you thought I told ya to pull it over
She pulled me over... pulled me out the rover
Then she pulled me closer... do me in the back of the car
Put me in handcuffs start ripping my pants off
(all you heard on the dispatcher was...)
Wee Ooh Wee Ooh Wee
Wee Ooh Wee Ooh Wee
Wee Ooh Wee Ooh Wee

[Chorus: Bobby Valentino]
When I get up all in ya
We can hear the angels calling us
We can see the sunrise before us
And when I'm in that thang, I'll make that body sang
I make it say...

[Bobby Valentino]
Maybe you can lock me up and throw away the key
Call your sergeant and tell him you can't finish your shift...
Cause it's on... tonight...
Breakfast in bed turns to breakfast & head
And I can't wait to get it on...
Wanna do it all night long... Mrs. Officer

[Chorus: Bobby Valentino]
When I get up all in ya
We can hear the angels calling us
We can see the sunrise before us
And when I'm in that thang, I'll make that body sang
I make it say...
Wee Ooh Wee Ooh Wee
Wee Ooh Wee Ooh Wee
Wee Ooh Wee Ooh Wee

Wee Ooh Wee Ooh Wee
Wee Ooh Wee Ooh Wee
Wee Ooh Wee Ooh Wee...
