[Intro]
Hey Walle, get on the phone man, call that nigga Meek Mill
Tell that nigga Meek Mill get on the phone call that nigga Boss
Tell Boss get on the phone, call that nigga French Montana man
Tell this nigga let me hold this beat too man, lego

Pop that, don't stop, pop that don't stop [x4]

Uncle Luke, you better that hoe,
I'm the shit bitch and I know you smell that hoe
Beat the pussy I swoll that hoe
Lick the cat and then mail hoe
Cop the Yeezys never wear that doe
You fuckin Kim K nigga share that hoe
Real nigga everywhere I go
You got one, you better marry that hoe
She got a fat monkey, a camel toe
She Armenian and she call me daddy-o
She like it from the back, no patio
I'm from the too live crew, her daddy know
I'm fresh as fuck, no flat top
I got flip flops in that black drop
No green screen in my black drop
I got green things in my backpack
I'm thugging, welcome back Pac
I'm a mac nigga, no laptop
My bitch ass fat and no ass shots
She get motivated when that cash drop
Don't call my bitch no stripper nigga
She's an exotic dancer to twerk when you tip her, nigga
Amber Rose ain't got nothing on Mulan
Megan Good, ain't got nothing on Chyna
And I know tyga, how I know tyga
Megan Good, ain't got nothing on Chyna
Shit Japan ain't got nothing on Chyna
Wish that was me, nothing on Chyna
Damn, there I go again
I ain't tryna start nothing by speaking nothing on Chyna
Don't stop, popping that, she pick it up and she dropping it
I like red bones a little chocolate
And I'm asap with that rocket list
And I'm swagging and splashing and fucking these hoes
I'm blowing that kush and it's stucked in my clothes
They blowing my dick 'til I nut in they nose
These niggaz they know they can't fuck with the flow
My mozzy is cold, my bitches are hot
We walk in the club, she sneak in the Glock
We turning it up, off of peach and Ciroc
With bottles and bottles
Like when does it stop?
With models and models they known to be fucking
She say she a virgin I know that she bluffing
I'm knockin and stuffin out that english muffin
I turn on the oven and whoaaa!!!

Coke boy I like 'ole boy
I got a gold impala like dope boy
Twerking it, working it
Like waffle house I'm serving it
They play with it, I'm murking shit
You Jasons kid, I'm Dirk and shit, you square niggaz with your circle head
And you don't stop, what you twerking with

[Chorus]

[French Montana]
Work, work, work, work, work, work
What you twerkin' with
Throw it, buss it open
Show me what you twerkin with
Ass so fat, need a lap dance
I'm in that white ghost chasin' Pac man
Hundred out the lot, I be leaning thats a rock
Hundred large bring a mop
Cars tinted like Barack
Got a brinks truck in my pocket
30 chains on my collar
2 drops, no mileage
Top off like Wallace
And I'm hella smoke, bitch know that
Filthy rich before rap
Your new deal, I throw that
3 Benz I'm on that
We pop a molly, she buss it open
She seen it, got it, that pussy soaking

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
I love my big booty bitches
My life a Godfather picture
Local club in my city
I fell in love with a stripper
Bitches know I'm that nigga
Talkin four door Bugatti
I'm the life of the party lets get these hoes on the Molly
You know I came to stunt
So drop that pussy bitch
I got what you want
Drop that pussy bitch
Feel me, feel me
This bitch want me to feel me
Ballin', ballin' like I play for New England
Spend it, spend it, spend a stack every minute
Thats 50, 100, I see no fucking limits
Shout out to Uncle Luke
Shout out my bitches too
We the 2 Live Crew
2 for me, 2 for you
Feed them bitches carrots
Fuck em like a rabbit
Sorry thats a habit
Smoke a spliff and then I vanish

[Chorus]

[Drake]
I'm about being single, seeing double, making triple
I hope you pussy niggaz hating never make a nickel
It's good to make it better when your people make it with you
Money coming, money going, ain't like you can take it with you
It's about to be a hit right now, fuck back then, we the shit right now
Dropped Take Care', bought a muthafuckin' crib
And I'm picking up the keys to the bitch right now
OVO that's major shit, Toronto with me that's Mayor shit
Gettin cheddar packs like KD, OKC that's playa shit
We don't dress alike, we don't rap alike
I shine different, I rhyme different
Only thing you got is some years on me
Man, fuck you and your time difference
I'm young Papi, champagne
They know the face, and they know the name
Got one watch that could probably pay for like all your chains
And you'd owe me change, ah!
Greystone, 20 bottles that's on me
On the couches, wildin' out
Yelling free my niggaz 'till they all free
One of my closest dawgs got 3 kids and they all 3
But we always been the type of crew that been good without a plan B

[Chorus]

[Lil' Wayne]
Biiiitch, Stop talkin' that shit
And suck a nigga dick for some Trukfit
Okay I fuck a bitch and I'm gone
That's gangsta Al Capone
I make that pussy spit like bone
Talkin' bout Bone, bone, bone, bone
I'm fucking wit' French, excuse my French
I lose my mind before I lose my bitch
Money ain't a thing but a chicken wing
Bitch I ball like 2 eyelids
YMCM-beat that pussy up
Stop playin', I make her ass scream and holla, like rock bands
I'mma beast, I'm off the leash
I am rich like a bitch
On my pro-active shit
Pop that pussy like a zit
I go by the name Lil Tunechi
Your girl is a groupie
And nigga, you's a square
And I would twist you like a rubix
Motherfucker I'm on my skateboard
Watch me do a trick hoe
I'm 5? 5 but I could 6-9
Then beat that pussy like Klistcko
It's French Montana, fuck joe
It's Weezy F, fuck hoes
It's Truk the world
It's Truk yo girl
It's Trukfit by the truck load, biaaaatch

[Chorus]
