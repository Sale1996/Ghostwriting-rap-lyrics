[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Grindin', grindin'
Grindin', grindin'
Grindin', grindin'
Grindin', grindin' (E-E-E-E-E)

[Lil Wayne]
Woo! I'm grindin', I'm grindin', I'm grindin' I promise
I fuck her until I get tired, retire and then come out retirement
My girl like it rough, she said "Find me a diamond"; her body be grindin'
Lord we be on every kind of narcotic that make us believe when we lyinâ, we honest
I love you.. pick, Michael Jackson to Jordan to Tyson to Myers
Too much dirty money when the colors are washin' the whites in the dryer, my nigga
It ainât rocket science just rockets; I sleep in pussy not pajamas, grindin'
I got this shit down to a science, I turn in my project, A minus
Woo! I ain't crazy, Iâm +Krazy+ and all of my niggas chaotic
Dressed in all black like they gothic, music too loud to hear sirens, we pop-pop-pop up where you stay
Knock-knock-knock, anyone home? Pop-pop-pop-pop then we outtie
I need a bitch like Naomi to take off her clothes like Leilani for niggas thatâs grindin'

[Chorus: Lil Wayne] {w/ Wayne ad-libbing in the background}
Nigga I'm grindin' for all my shit, grindin' for all my shit
Yeah, I'm grindin' for all my shit, I put time into all this shit
Man, I'm grindin' for all my shit, I'm grindin' for all my shit
Perfect timin' with all my shit, I'm grindin' for all my shit

[Lil Wayne]
The feds be spyin' on all of us nigga, these hoes be lyin' to all of us nigga
I got news for the monogamous niggas, yo bitch fuckin' anonymous niggas
I done seen it all my nigga cause these hoes seein' all of my niggas
Cause what's the hottest shit on these corners? That's me and all my niggas~!!
Grind for all this shit, I ainât ever fall for that bitch
Cause pickin' up the feather from a lovebird is like a medicine ball to that bitch
We'll bring a Gucci bag in this bitch (this bitch!) and you know what's stashed in that bitch (this bitch!)
These niggas walk around with they chests out like Janet Jackson and shit
I'm sweatin' grindin' this bitch, I need a shrine in this bitch
Fuck 007, I work twenty-four seven, ain't got time to +Bond+ with no bitch
Heard Jay-Z got a new Cognac, where to find that shit?
The weed sticky, grind that shit, where I got it from? Nevermind that shit
Nigga I'm grindin'

[Chorus]

[Drake]
Yeah...
I got a new vision for all my shit, I don't know what to call that shit
I know I'm sellin' all of my cars, Iâm sellin' all of my watches, Iâm sellin' diamonds and all of that shit
Realized I donât need that shit, I'm a different breed with this shit
I'm tryna turn Ms to Bs in this bitch and I ainât ever pay to be with no bitch
I, I, I want that Brigitte BardÃ³t hangin' over my bed, fifty mil' in one room
You, you could ask anyone out here who runnin' the game and they'll tell you the truth
Man, they'll tell you; oh look, they fuck with me now, I think they're hearin' me now
Someone said "Nigga they takin' you seriously now" I'm like "I think they just might be scared of me now"
But it's all good, niggas wrong every day, niggas wrong every day
Go, goin' to LA where I'm tryna get high and do a song every day
Safe, we ainât ever have to play it safe
I would rather stack it up and put it in a safe than peek inside the safe and see Iâm runnin' out of space
Mothafucka thatâs grindin'

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
(Grindin', grindin') Perfect timin'
(Grindin', grindin')
(Grindin', grindin')
I would rather stack it up and put it in the safe than peek inside the safe and say Iâm runnin' out of space
Believe that

Scoob, find another oo-wop, tell them niggas cool out cause it can be a mu'fuckin' shoot-out
Kidnap a nigga, beat the truth out, moms pick the suit out, top floor, window he get threw out
Deuce out, pussy bitches, deuce out, flyin' out the crew out, they flew out - invite 'em to my new house, my new house
I'm fuckin' every night up in my new house cause bitch I worked too hard for this new house, grindin'
I'm fuckin' every night up in my new house cause bitch I worked too hard for this new house, I'm grindinâ
I'm fuckin' every night up in my new house cause bitch I worked too hard for this new house, I'm grindin'
