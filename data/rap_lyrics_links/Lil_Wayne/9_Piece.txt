[Rick Ross - Intro] (Lil Wayne)
RUH!...(YMCMB) 
RUH!..
As I look around, we the only niggaz with that A1 Perico
UHH!
 
[Chorus: Rick Ross]
I'm smokin dope, I'm on my cell phone
I'm sellin dope, straight off the iPhone
He wanna quote, he talkin nine zones
He bought fo', I front him five mo'
Nine piece, straight eight balls
MJG, bitch I got +8-Balls+
Nine piece, straight eight balls
MJG, bitch I got +8-Balls+
 
[Rick Ross]
Suave House, still independant
Distribution Mexican, he still sendin
No contract, take my word
send a hundred packs bitch, them my birds
(Uhhhhhh!!) Shoe box, no shoes in 'em
in the two seater, me and two women (RO-SAY!)
No Def Jam, went solo (solo!)
Took the custy's prices so low
 
[Chorus]
 
[Lil Wayne]
It's Lil Tunechi...Waddup doe?
IÄôm talkin white girl -- Marilyn Monroe
And I can get 'em for the Sweet 16
HARD dope, call it HD flat-screen
Fuck outta here, yo' shit water-whipped
you got that tan dope, look like a Florida bitch
Automatic leave 'em dead in the living room
Get it~? Leave 'em dead in the +living+ room
Fuck all these niggaz and tell them bitches to kiss my ass
I put that pistol to his head and tell that nigga to have a blast
FUCK you mean?! IÄôm talkingkeys like Ray Charles
Rack 'em up, pool table full of 8-balls
Yah!

[Chorus]
 
[Rick Ross]
Soft white, I got that G-mix!
I'm goin gold, crumbs to the bricks
(Uh!) I'm on the road, let's buy some NEW whips
Trick a hundred hoes, spend a few chips (RO-SAY!)
Nine piece, straight eight balls..
Bitch I'm blowin up like napalm (Whoo!)
Gotcha bottom bitch goin A.W.O.L.
Niggaz lookin at cha like you fell off
NO SIR -- NOT ME! (NOT ME!)
I'm double platinum just like my Ferrari
Bullet proof, nigga Teflon
Why you snortin that? That shit stepped on

[Chorus]
