[Lil Wayne]
I woke up in that pussy and startin' strokin'
You woke up and said "Go baby"
She said "Fuck me hard, don't take it easy on me
Don't do me no favors"
.. No neighbors
Pussy like water, got no smell, ain't got no flavor
She treat the tip of my dick like a waitress
She doin' tricks on my dick cause I'm a skater, ay~!

[Christina Milian]
We've been drinkin' and they've been talkin'
But we ain't worried, we just look the other way
It's time to roll up and get it started
It's bout that time, I've been feenin' all day
I want you right now
Right in the skate park, ridin' on your skateboard
You, right now - we drunk in love
I wanna do it all night, we won't stop
Got me feelin' like Aaliyah when you make my +Boat+ +Rock+
Baby be my leader, tell me how you want it papi
How you want it papi? How you want it?

[Chorus 2X: Christina Milian]
We gon' be fuckin' all night, we ain't makin' love
We ain't makin' love
So you gon' watch me - wha-wha-wha, drop it like it's hot
I'ma - wha-wha-wha, drop it like it's hot

[Lil Wayne]
Okay, okay, hol' up
Throw that, throw that pussy girl; throw that, throw that pussy
Got you walkin' crooked, lookin' drunk as Uncle Woody
Hol' up, I don't even drink, I just be on that drank
I just be on that dank and wide awake like I ain't
So I'ma wear that ass out all night, you get hard dick all day
Pussy always tight and warmer than The North Face
Ooh, talkin' crazy, dick gon' have you walkin' crazy
Round this bitch lookin' handicapped, at least you'll get good parkin' spaces
Look at things on the bright side, hit that ass from the right side
I'ma fuck the shit out ya, no more Mr. Nice Guy
Ooh girl, you gon' get this dick, we don't do romance
She ride the dick so fast like "Look ma, no hands"
Oh, I'ma pull her hair, I don't care if it ain't her hair
I'ma paint her pussy lips white, white like Dave Chappelle
You gon' suck your finger, after you play with yourself
I'm like "Fuck all that singin', you about to yell"

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
I woke up in that pussy and startin' strokin'
You woke up and said "Go baby"
She said "Fuck me rough, don't take it easy on me
Don't do me no favors" (ay)
.. No neighbors (ay)
Fuck you so hard you turn around like "Goodness gracious" (ay)
You ask for this and you know I accommodate ya
She doin' tricks on my dick cause I'm a skater, ay~!

[Christina Milian]
And that purp mixed with that Sprite
My body high and we gettin' right with that Swisher hit that light
Boy no speakin', we freakin', play around with my boy toy
He slidin' through that half pipe while I'm ridin' on that skateboard
Skateboard, skateboard
Ridin' on that, grindin'-grindin' on that (hol' up)
He surfin' all that, he surfin' all that hood hood
I'm ridin' on that, twerk-twerkin' on that good good

[Chorus]

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
And this that "Sorry"
This that, you won't be sorry
No, you won't be sorry, yeah
Thank you for your patience, ay~!
This that "Sorry 4 The Wait 2"
You won't be sorry; no, you won't be sorry
But this that "Sorry 4 The Wait 2"
And I thank you for your patience, yeah
