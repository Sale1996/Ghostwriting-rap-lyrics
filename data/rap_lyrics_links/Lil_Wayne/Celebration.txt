[Intro]
Get high, get high, get high, get high, get high
Westside, westside, westside, westside, westside
(YOUNG MULA BAAAY-BAY!)

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
We havin' a celebration, love to stay high {*4X*}

[Game]
Nigga blowin' on that ayo, breakin' down them trees
I'm out the door with dro and the keys, scoopin' up Chris and I'm hitting the freeway
Yeah, got a whole zip of that purp
Got a couple hoes home with no clothes on, get they roll on, let's twerk
Now we hotboxin' that Ghost, Ace all in that Ghost
Ray Bans in my face, never know when my eyes low
Smoke good, fuck good, eat good, steakhouse
She said backwoods, kill swishers, you eat, take out
Yeah, but I love fuckin' them redbones
She country thick and that hair long, that pussy killer, she dead wrong
She went to Howard, her head strong, her mamma tall, so her legs long
She went to college and got her masters, now she bringing that bread home
Roll up...

[Chris Brown]
Put the purp in the bluuuuuunt
(Get high, get high, get high, get high, get high)
Put the purp in the bluuuuuunt, yeah
(Westside, westside, westside, westside, westside)

[Chorus] - 2X

[Chris Brown]
It's a celebration, all on the pole they doing the dance
Anticipating I'm feeling your body, hoping that you would just give me a chance
God damn babe, just hold your glass up for this toast
My cash up and yo ass up, and I'm the one tippin' the most
Tonight, on the westside
And if you wanna roll, have the best fuckin night of your life
No lie, no lie
Me and you together girl I'm celebratin' you tonight..

[Tyga]
Uhh, yeah I'm blooooown - no cigarillo, rillo
Love when I'm mellow, get on my level; 101 karats in my bezel
I'm oooooon, like soon as the ice cream truck at the ghetto
Little knucklehead always in trouble soon as I ask shawty her number, fashoooooo
Yeah I get it, then I'm gone
Then I hit it like bone bone, now you fuckin' up my zone (my zone, my zone)
Said she wait when daddy come home
Told me she ain't got nothing on - I'm talkin' no th-thong, thong, thong
Yeah, she throwin' that ass back
Hard as a bat, sit on my lap, fuckin' with me, ain't nothing better than that
That's a fact (that's a fact?) Don't act hollywood cause I don't act
'Bout my business but I don't slack; this my celebration rap, so

[Chorus]

[Lil' Wayne]
Uhh, I pour up for Pimp C, light up for Soulja Slim
Straight out the gutter, with the rest of the bowlin' pins
Money for days, bitches go both ways
On the road to riches, bitch I got road rage
Got the kush in the swisher, got the pussy, the liquor
Got a silencer on the gun, take it off like a stripper
Yeah, wake up, wake up, I'm goin' at your face make up
These niggas need stitches cause they taking pay cuts
Man somebody tell them hoes it's a celebration
All my niggas got guns no registration
Yeah, now go an' light that weed up
I'm Trukfit, tee'd up, hoes down, B's up
Tunechi... YOUNG MULA BAAAY-BAY!

[Wiz Khalifa] + (Chris Brown)
Rollin and chokin and movin slow motion, I'm floatin on goooooooood
(Put the purp' in the bluuuuuunt)
Rollin and chokin and movin slow motion, I'm floatin on goooooooood
(Put the purp' in the bluuuuuunt, yeah) Hahahaha...

[Chorus] - 2X
