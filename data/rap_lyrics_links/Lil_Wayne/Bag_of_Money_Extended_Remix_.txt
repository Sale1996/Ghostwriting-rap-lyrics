C'mon baby girl let's spend this money (Yeah-EAH! Oooh-ooh-whoo)

My chick bad looking like a bag of hunnids (Ohh-oh-ooh-woooo-ooh-ooooooooh)

[Interlude: Rick Ross] + (T-Pain)
She got me caught up in the moment (She got me caught up in the mo-MENT!)
She got me caught up in the moment (She got me caught up in the moment)
I only kiss her when she on it (Ooh, when she on it)
White Ferrari and she got her doin donuts, hol' up (Oooh-ooh-whoo)

[Wale]
You got some nice pineapples, for real
Haha... Wale though, double M, remix

Be like Wa-le my stroke game be on point
Yeah, shawty losing her mind her composure most of her voice
And she say she hate the word moist but she can't escape from that vibe
You can play fight with that cat, me, I kill that pussy 9 times
I slow it dooown, let me slow it down
Ever since I hit that look at it that shit I got you poking now
Numbers we ain't throwing dooown, not me, no way, no how
Cause you know them screenshot broads always gonna run they mouth
Ok I'm far too drunk I'm not driving (what's up?), you know open bars are on fire
A little green and white in my pocket, so this song is now "Bag of Mara"
Caught up in the wrong timing, yeah, Jacob made my medallion
Just post up but don't coach much, but I love the stadium talent

[Omarion]
Bright lights picture, all right colors
I'll let you count my money, don't think that you own me
You my bag of my money, you my bag of honey
I beez in your trap, while you yelling fuck me
I be on some other shiiiit
Maybach O up in this biiitch
Tell you about them other niggas
They be lying about they figures - I'm bout it, bout it I pull the trigger
Y'all be so lame
We killin the game; I dance in the bank
We so mafioso you ain't never know though
Never gonna know so, no never no, no, no, no, no, no

[Chorus] - 1X

[Yo Gotti]
(I'm YO GOTTI~!)
My bitch amazing, show stopper
Work at the titty club, pussy popper
Top drop white on white 645
I burnt her up from 5 O'clock until 6:45
Mr 60 minutes, Mrs Chanel and Fendi
I hit her in the Porsche and burnt her up a new Infiniti
Presidential Rollie, JFK she Mrs. Kennedy
Rose gold his or hers, diamonds and furs
Want a little suede, one on one bag
Look like a duffle bag of money, she beyond that
And I'm beyond swag, young thug nigga
Drug dealer; MMG affiliated blood nigga
That 50k on that vaca
20 bands on that birkin bag, 12 hunnid on that dinner date
We eat lobsters from Florida, French-ful flowers
Put you on the next level shit, world is ours

[Rockie Fresh]
Got my sox cap, top back, shorty you could come outside
We can ride, drive an '88 you know how we drive
You just want somebody that's consistent and that will provide
I'm just trying to live in your division when your legs divide (Rockie Fresh)
I could take you high, you say your man don't appreciate you
He should learn to be more grateful for somebody that's been faithful
Instead he trying to play you, you know trying to Stevie J you
I just wanna make you rain like we in the month of April
And we hella young, let's have some fun and never be on dummy
Got a good sense of humor but you can't be acting funny
You will get ate for dinner, but I'm hungry for some money
Every time I go and get it, then I'll let you count it for me

[Chorus] - 1X

[Trina]
I-I-I'm looking like a money money money badge
That's why these niggas want me bad
Cause I'm so fucking special, diamonds and precious metals
Giuseppe stilettos, I'm the queen of the ghetto
Trina, I stay winning, I keep these niggas spinning
I'm looking for a boss, let me be your lieutenant
Let me be your masseuse, fine head in the coupe
MÃ©nage in the suite, boy you know I'm the truth
I stay stunning looking like a bad of hundreds
You know your momma running, I keep that money coming
He bring that money home, he let me count it for him
Now I'm married to the mob and I'm riding for him

[Lil Wayne]
Uh, my-my bitch mad cause I'd rather get that money
I give her this dick she say that dick better than money
I say can I get some head she say let me get my scrungie
Serve her like a country, got that dope dick she a junkie
She say "Tunechi this your pussy", I say "tell me anything"
Then I suck her nipple ring, eat that pussy, listerine
She coming I make sure my bitch bad; she'll take yours
And she do tricks on that dick like a skateboard

[Tyga]
Uh, Maybach Riders, gold chain buyers
Gold wings saline your bitch say I'm the flyest
I make five thou gold ya'll, spent that in about an hour
And my bitch like Bob May ball hard till I get the callous
Shout out I ain't got no stylist, shout out to you niggas keep trying
Bag of money bag of money, I eat the money like I eat the pussy
King gold chains they follow me, presidential car presidential suite
She bad and all, model type, but I like me a big BOOTY~!
One time for them 9-5's, one time for them stripper dimes
One time for them college girls, one time for those who can't decide
I love her more I take them all, she doing bad I break her off
I'm T-raw don't need ya'll, everything I do is so +Well Done+

[Chorus] - 1X

[French Montana]
I push the drop and let her ride shotty
My bitch bad looking like a bag of mollies
Hit the crib make a porno, my diamonds flash like photos
500 on my auto and I bought it out, fuck car note
Shorty know exactly who the realest is
Murder that AHH leave no witnesses
Started from the streets, turned to business'
Dirty bag of money, stack it to where that ceiling is
Got, shorty, grab it, take it, to that, money
Shorty, dancing, for them, hundreds, got me, paying, on exonics
Bitch I'm ballin' all green, tryin to buy a ball team
No I suit her, roosting, know we going all in

[Black Cobain]
Rollin up some killer, ridin through my city
Bumping Bag of Money got a bag of money with me
She conceited, she know that, she was down with a nigga before rap
If I had the strap she would hold that - she don't even smoke but she'll roll that
For me she drinking Henny she don't like it though
She fuck with real niggas cause that's all she know
Make her pop that pussy hole, make her bring that money back
You niggas couldn't fuck my bitch if you gave her a hundred stacks
She all about a purse, not a bag though she work
When I'm in the pussy I surf, when she bless a nigga, like church~!
I'm on this bag of money remix
I'll be all up in her Vickie's but she cannot keep a secret

[Chorus] - 1X

[Interlude] + [Chorus]
