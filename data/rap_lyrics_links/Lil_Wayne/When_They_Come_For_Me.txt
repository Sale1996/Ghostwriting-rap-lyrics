[Chorus]
Tell them boys I'll be here, when they come for me
Me and every single nigga, that got love for me
See I got money on my mind but haters won't leave me alone
So I'm ridin' everyday with every pistol that I own
Tell them, I'll be here when they come for me
Me and every single nigga, that got love for me
See I got money on my mind but haters won't leave me alone
So I'm ridin' everyday with every pistol everyday with every pistol

[Verse 1]
Yeah, nigga you done fucked up, nigga back the fuck down
I dont care where I go, I dont care what you know
I dont care what you say, I put the words back down your throat
I dont care where you stay, nigga I'm from up town
I gotta get 'em Slim, they talkin' beef to me
They just a bunch a bitches, they talkin' sweet to me
Pussy niggas, I guess I gotta eat pussy
Put a hole in 'em, now thats some deep pussy
The cops hate me, but a star is born
The streets love me, but how long will they mourn
I'm a real nigga, say real nigga thangs
But it dont have no name

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
I never fold, I just take my chance
I let life deal, but I just take my hand
Protection off safety, I look straight ahead
I got them niggas Weezy, thats what the 380. said
You got to play in the field to get paid
Then you got to go lay in the bed that you made
Its Cash Money its the army brigade
And I'm spittin like I ate a grenade
I'm dippin in the empire fade and the one with the butt (yeah)
Put the wings up and straight show em my guts, yuck
My swaggers so mean and I know how to operate that machine (brrroooww)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Yep, yep, aim at his brain, make a nigga learn
And if thats chopper bullets, then they suppose to burn
And if you been to jail, I never seen a cell
But I come from New Orleans, yeah right there under hell
Tell my gal dont you worry bout nothin but see
These niggas want me dead, so hug me tight when you fuck me
I told her I'm strapped, I'm a rider girl
And I'm a shoot from every side like around the world
Uh, believe that you, can tell em bring the whole gang
I'm a get you but that automatic touchin' er'thing
Nigga its the Birdman J.R., pure pain, you just a curb stain

[Chorus]
