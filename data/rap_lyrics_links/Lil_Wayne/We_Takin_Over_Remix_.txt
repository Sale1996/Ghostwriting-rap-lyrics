[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Yezzir... it's me, the rapper eater
Feed me, feed me, feed me!
No homo

[Lil Wayne]
One time for me, one time for the DJ
He be Khaled, I be Lil Weezy
Baby, if you ask me if you're nasty
Creative gifted bastard, spit sporadic
I'm so diplomatic democratic
Touch it, bring it, push it systematic
Damn right, I kissed my daddy
I think they pissed at how rich my daddy is
And I'm his kid I stunt with my daddy
Call Mrs. Lee, she's with my daddy
So diss me and dont diss my daddy
Cause who was there when no one wasn't? Just my daddy
Who was there when I needed money? Just my daddy
So who'll be there when I see the money? Just my daddy
Who said that I be the one? Just my daddy
Hello Hip Hop I'm home, It's your daddy
When I say D's, I don't mean the caddy
I mean 'deez nuts' Akon's and Khaled's
Rick Ross, TIP, Stunna and Fat Joe
And I can't, can't, can't forget Brisco
And yeah I done squashed the bullshit it's rizo
It's a bakery here just trying to get dough
Shout to my Dreads, my Haitians and Chico's
You're lookin for me hoe? I'm in the 3-0
5 - I'm the best rapper alive
Homeboy got a mind, that a map wouldn't find
Homeboy got a 9, that a cop wouldn't find
I could get to it even if I was blind
Scary movie be screaming when I rhyme
I'ma 'King' you can ask 'Stephen' if I'm lying
I'ma Prince too demanding like my mom
Too bold too cold like wet Sa-lam
Me! Me! It's all about me!
If a girl gotta voice then she talking about me!
Me, He say, she say, I say me!
Will be in the M.I.A. me!
With me! And T! And Big Ronnie!
And the homie Street probably somewhere on the beach
And Tez and E probably somewhere in the jeep
And Marl in the Phantom with Mr. G
And me! Me! It's all about me!
Play with me and it's all out beef
Beef! Yes! Chest! Feet!
Tag! Bag! Blood! Sheets!
Yikes! Yeeks! Great! Scott!
Storch! Can I borrow your yacht?
Watch me and my click go all out
Like the ball in the stands we balls out
Boy I don't know what y'all 'bout
But I just spit like a dog mouth
Pink ice just looking like a hog mouth
VRRRMMM ...I had to bring the hog out
Light dem trees bring the log out
Everyday Christmas I'm egged nogged out
And hip-hop is my new bought house
My flow just grew legs and walked out
Bye
