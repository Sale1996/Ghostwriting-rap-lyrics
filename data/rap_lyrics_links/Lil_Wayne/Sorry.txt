[Dame D.O.L.L.A.]
You feel me?

I get to the money with ease
I'm different, they jacking my steez
I'm the new wave of seabreeze
Now praying and she on her knees
I might just go get a 'Rari (Skrt)
OG gang like an Atari
In the A, Zaza my party (Check)
Humble, but sorry, not sorry (Sorry)

Ayy, sorry, not sorry (Sorry)
Ayy, sorry, not sorry (Sorry)
Ayy, sorry, not sorry (Sorry)
Ayy, sorry, not sorry (I'm sorry)
Uh, sorry, not sorry (I'm sorry)
Ayy, sorry, not sorry (I'm sorry)
Ayy, sorry, not sorry

Pull up on 'em in a Bentley (Bentley)
Hard top for two-fifty (Fifty)
Paid cash, all century
Paperwork with some whiskey (Uh)
I just be handling biz (I do)
Don't know where the manager is (I don't)
They need to have me on cribs (They do)
Feel like a bed, I'm a kid (Kid)
Infiniti pull in the back (Back)
Your chick wanna fool with a mac (Mac)
She asking around for my jack (Jack)
But she only wanting the pack (Uh)
I fly on the jet to relax (Relax)
Triple champagne for the snack (The snack)
Suckers wanna hit me with a dap (Dap)
50/50, get the strop (Pow)

I get to the money with ease (Ease)
I'm different, they jacking my steez (Swag)
I'm the new wave of seabreeze (Uh)
Now praying and she on her knees
I might just go get a 'Rari (Skrt)
OG gang like an Atari
In the A, Zaza my party (Check)
Humble, but sorry, not sorry (Sorry)

Ayy, sorry, not sorry (Sorry)
Ayy, sorry, not sorry (Sorry)
Ayy, sorry, not sorry (Sorry)
Ayy, sorry, not sorry (I'm sorry)
Uh, sorry, not sorry (I'm sorry)
Ayy, sorry, not sorry (I'm sorry)
Ayy, sorry, not sorry

I'm not sorry at all

I'm not sorry for all of these foreigns
I'm not sorry for y'all being worried
