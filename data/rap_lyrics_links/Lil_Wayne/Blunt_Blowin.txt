[Lil Wayne]
I live it up like these are my last days
If time is money, I'm an hour past paid
Ughh, gunpowder in my hourglass
Niggaz faker than some flour in a powder bag
Yeah, I put it down like my hands hurtin
I'm on a natural high, but I land perfect
Some of us are lovers, most of y'all haters
But I put up a wall, and they just wallpaper
So love or hate me, I stay hate-free
They say we learn from mistakes, that's why they mistake me
I got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feathers
All hail Weezy, call it bad weather
I stick to the script, I memorize the lines
'Cause life is a movie that I've seen too many times
You're on the outside lookin in, close the blinds
And they say never say never, but fuck it never mind
I've been gone too long
True or false, right or wrong
Hello Weezy, welcome home

[Chorus]
I'm a blunt blowin', Polo draws showin'
I don't give a lovely motherfuck ass nigga
With my money growin, no matter where you goin
You don't need a bus pass, for me to bust your ass nigga
I'm a blunt blowin', Polo draws showin'
I don't give a lovely motherfuck ass nigga
With my money blowin, don't matter I got more and
You don't need a bus pass, for me to bust your ass nigga

[Lil Wayne]
Stunna, I got em, I'm back on them bitches
All about my riches, my name should be Richard
Cut the bullshit out, I'm ample with the scissors
Life is a choice, and death is a decision
Times have changed, but fuck it get a new watch
I still got the vision like a line between two dots
Young Money's eatin, the label gettin fatter
And yeah, the tables turned, but I'm still sittin at 'em
I'm a bad motherfucker, cuz the good die young
Everybody sellin dreams, I'm too cheap to buy one
Man when that cookie crumble, everybody want a crumb
Shoot that humming bird down, humming bird don't hum, yeah
Big money, big money, deep pockets
Money talks and muh'fuckers eavesdroppin
Bunch of bloods, you could call it blood clottin
East side, my Parodamo

[Chorus 2]
I'm a blunt blowin, Polo draws showin
I don't give a lovely motherfuck ass nigga
With my teeth glowin, I'm on my Deebowin'
You don't need a bus pass, for me to bust your ass nigga
I'm a blunt blowin, Polo draws showin
I-I don't give a lovely motherfuck ass nigga
With my money blowin, no matter where you goin
You don't need a bus pass, for me to bust your ass nigga

[Verse 3]
Light that Ashton Kutcher, I'm a limit pusher
Y'all dead meat, and me I'm just a butcher
I do it for the money, man I am such a hooker
And freedom was my girl, until they fuckin took her
You can look into the future, it's right behind your eyelids
But I don't wanna know, 'cause shit I like surprises
Why that, why this, why you on that why shit?
Motherfucker ask me why, I say YM
Beach bum, call me ocean drive slim
Drop the top, look up and make the sky grim
Young Moolah, skinnies and some supras
Belly of the beast till it puke us
Muh'fucker

[Chorus 2]

[Outro]
I've been gone too long
True or false, right or wrong
[repeat 3x]
Hello Weezy, welcome home
It's Young Moolah, baby
Young Moolah, baby
Bitch I've been gone too long
True or false, right or wrong
Hello Weezy, welcome home... YEAH
