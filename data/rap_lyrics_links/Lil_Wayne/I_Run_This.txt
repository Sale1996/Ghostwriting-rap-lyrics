[Lil Wayne]
Uh-huh, yeah
Check me out
Look!

[Chorus: Lil Wayne] + (Birdman)
(I run this bitch~!) And I'ma keep runnin
I'ma keep runnin but I'm never runnin outta money
I'ma dog, I'ma stunt, if I don't do nuttin
And my car so pretty all these hoes wanna fuck it
I got pussy wet paint, big boy shoes
Soft-ass seats and my trunk go boom
Got a black-ass gun and a bad yellow bitch
And it looks like I'ma die like this

[Birdman]
Cause we be stunin on these bitches, get money on these bitches
$250 on the wrist nigga we be the illest
We be the realist, CMB niggaz
Uptown soldier with the money to the ceiling
Shinin like a diamond from a eagle to a pigeon
Birds on the wire hundred deep and we chillin
Fanger on the trigger that's that uptown livin
High to the sky no divin for fishes
Hustlin, doin donuts in the Lamb'
Candy on the slab, 50 on the ave
Hundred at the crib, get it how you live
Stuntin on these bitches, red diamonds how I feel

[Chorus]

[Birdman]
I'm a uptown solider, know how I roll her
Money go get her, M.O.B. all over
Hustlin with the birds, known to take it off your shoulder
Grindin with the homies, got the game out the 'Nola
Hundred G's wrap, hood with a strap
Blowin on the dojo, nigga stuntin in a 'llac
Chicken in the oven, wall safe for the stack
Bought a brand new Range, and a brand new 'bach
Old school Caddy, fifth wheel smack back
A brand new truck, a brand new bike
A brand new house, a brand new psych
A brand new bitch live a hood rich life

[Chorus] - 2X (second time with ad libs)

[Birdman]
Cash Money forever, ya heard me?
Birdman, Lil Wayne, ya heard?
Them niggaz know they gangsta in the hood ya heard?
I'ma nigga out the Magnolia I can claim it ya heard?
Them niggaz bitch street man
They all was raised together man
Niggaz Birdman and Lil Wayne, gangsters for life nigga
