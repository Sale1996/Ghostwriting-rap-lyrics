[Gudda Gudda]
GUDDA~!
Yeah, man we came from the bottom (from the bottom)
Stunna told me get these niggas so I got 'em (I got 'em!)
Man these women treat you different when you poppin' (dat right)
Well I ain't trippin' I'm just tryna get inside 'em (hah) - deep sea divin'
And I'm just happy that a nigga made it (we made it!)
And I'm able to put food on my kitchen table (we did it)
Life is crazy, I remember I ain't have shit
Now I'm in the foreign, mashin' on the gas quick (SKRRT~!)
Gotta watch my back, these niggas hatin' on a young nigga (GUDDA!)
Stand up nigga; I will never run nigga (nah)
God as my witness, I'mma be the one nigga (dat right)
Shock the world and let 'em watch my kingdom come nigga (let get it)
10 killers can't amount to this one nigga (nope)
I never fold, keep my hand on my gun nigga (BLAOW)
Momma told me kill 'em with my music slowly
The game over, and I'mma cross over like Kobe - let get it nigga!

[Interlude: Birdman]
Yeah, nothin' but money in that field nigga
We out there shinin' and trappin'
Just know it's real out there, so be real out there
Stacks on top of stacks
Bitches, whips, floss, gettin' in puttin' it in nigga

[Jae Millz]
(Millz!) Swerve on a hater like "fuck your life" (fuck)
Just out of spite, if that's your girl then I'mma fuck her twice (AOWWW~!)
Where I'm from here, if you ain't known better tuck your ice
I'll put a brick on your head, consider that your price (yeah)
If its about money, you can count me in
I'll turn 50 to 100 before you can count to 10 (believe it!)
End up missin' fuckin with Millz, never found again
Rappers thinks they nice; congrats, they must have found my pen (hah!)
Shit is real, I take it to the heart now (yep)
I never gave a fuck so why start now? (Nope)
You boys goldfish, swimmin' with the sharks now (yeah)
Fuck what you drive, just know you will get parked now (BLAOW!)
Millzy in this bitch, and now I'm on the top now
I used to want the streets, got those I want the charts now (come on)
What I rap I live it (uh-huh) what I make I flip it (uh-huh)
Money stand tall as Roy Hibbert, hater forget it - Young Money!

[Interlude: Birdman]
Yeah, where I'm from nigga, even killas get killed
Just the life boy; the bigger the nigga, the bigger the bullet
But at the end of the day it's all about that money nigga
Ball, baby ball, ya understand me?
From 100 to 1000, nigga; yea, from a mil' to these mils man

[Flow]
Yeah, okay, them birds fly high but we get them bitches cheap (yea)
Table full of coke, who say two mountains never meet? (ha)
Glock .23 and a chopper with a stock lift (BLAP!)
Bandanna tied around my head on my Pac shit (yea)
Watch em run and yell, bitch nigga tuck your tail (ha)
Click clack (BAH! BAH!) throw the Glock in the canal
You know young'n keep it real so you gotta respect him
All my niggas kill for me they so overprotective (ha)
And what's up with these rappers? I ain't feelin' these niggas (no)
Had a talk with Birdman, he told me "kill these lil bitches" (yeah)
Man they can't fuck wit me (yea) I hope they second guess (yea)
Nigga you ain't raw like dope that's recompressed
I'll kick in your fuckin door everybody in your house die (BLAOW BLAOW!)
You better stay in line or chalk you out, now you outlined
Tried to show his ass, fucked around and got assed out
Rich Gang bitch but I do this for the have-nots

[Mack Maine]
Uhh, man fuck these niggas
When I strike I'm sparin' everything but these niggas
Got a fresh pair of J's (J's) all gold shades
Rappin' like the boss, lookin' and I'm tryna get a raise
But bitch I'm the boss so a nigga gettin paid (yeah)
Customized life, I got it made (uh-huh)
Boy you know my chicks is like speakers, 12's and 15's
With mad rump in the trunk if you know what I mean (ha)
Fuck Twitter nigga, in real life nobody follows ya (yeah)
Ya momma should've swallowed ya (yeah) ya daddy ain't proud of ya (yeah)
Them niggas that you with ain't got ya back ya crew frontin (hmm)
Bunch of pump fakers actin' like they gon' shoot somethin (ha!)
The coupe that I copped the other day was 2 somethin

Young Mack my driver but I'm Captain Phillips niggas
I'm in the water like a pirate, you gassed I'm a hybrid
Uh, I get cougars in my granddaddy shirt
And get my weed off my family tree, that's granddaddy purp
You get found under the earth or in the trunk by the bazooka
I'm on the side of the road just like a state trooper
I run up in your castle, steal your princess - King Koopa
Better have some weed in that bitch if you pass me that hookah
I need the cover of the Forbes (Forbes) before I leave my corpse (corpse)
Streets say that I'm abusive, I always whip the Porsche (haha)
You ain't in the streets you just jumped off the porch
You's a sidewalk nigga (yeah) for that side talk nigga (yeah)
I'll barbecue your ribs when the fire spark nigga (yeah)
And tonight I'm in the six, I left the five parked nigga (haha)
I smoke that Tokyo until a nigga look Asian (uhh)
Bitch I ball hard, Sugar Slim my sports agent (uhh)
Young Paul George, I'm +Indiana Pacin'+
Surgin' with that yoppa I'll give ya ass a facelift (BLRRT~!)
We the ones to fear though (yeah) strong like the Chapperos
Allergic to normal, certified weirdos
Niggas online be like "fuck you!" I be like ditto (fuck you nigga)
I'm coolin puffin' good with Lil Izo at the cribbo (ha!)
Hungry Hungry Hippo, don't cha' be greedy
I get rich with my Rich Gang and give to the needy (yeah)
With Mack in the building pimps retire or get fired (who there)
It's +Young Money+ the +Rise of a fucking Empire+ - I'm gone

[Outro: Birdman]
