[Gudda Gudda]
UH...Uh...
UH...Uh... Yeah
Okay, I walk up in the club, Louie-Louie's with the cherry bottoms
Bad bitch on my arm witta Halle Berry body
You know what I do, I, g-get straight to the moolah
Wrist-wr-wr-wrist wear frigid and my watch is a Franck Muller
I-I'm reppin Young Moolah, G-Gudda times two, I
remember when I used to stuff my paper in my shoe box
Now I got two large accounts with money stacks and large amounts
What the FUCK you niggaz talkin bout 'cause we ain't tryna talk it out
Pistol hangin out my jeans - it ain't a thing, let's spark it out
Let that chopper start to sing and let it ring and then I'm out, yeah
You know what Im sippin, purple got me trippin
Scoop ya chicken up and let her lick me like a lizard
I'm on South Beach chillin and I'm tryna fuck, ER'RY hottie
Get her to the crib and make her fuck ER'RY-body
You know the team, it's Young Money over ER'RY-body
In the rap game, so it's FUCK ERR'BODY!

[Lil Wayne]
Married to the mob, bury you alive
My girl pussy feel like heaven to a god
And I came in this bitch with my niggaz
Kidnap the baby and the fuckin babysitter, yah
I be doin me, don't give a fuck 'bout whatchu doin
Blood gang bitch, big B's, Boston Bruins
I could do this shit, eyes closed, nothin to it
Bullets fuck ya body up, they ain't even tryna view it
I go tough, I go stupid
Murk ya pussy ass and everyone you in cahoots with
Fuck you with a pool stick, make you swallow tooth picks
Fuckin right we ruthless, we done watched too many movies
Then smoked too many doobies, murk you out then deuces
We don't know what truce is, that bulletproof vest so useless
Flag red like bruises, shoot at'cha head with them Uzis
I swear, ya Honor, I ain't a dealer, I'm a user, ya dig?
I load up the cig, point it at'cha wig
Pull over on the highway, throw you off the bridge
We don't give a fuck, and we ain't never did
Shit, three words you never hear: let 'em live
I'm in my own zone, it got me throwed off
I break these bitches down, I break these hoes off
Lil Tunechi is my name, I got Gudda on the tape
Public apology, Sorry 4 the Wait, yeah!
