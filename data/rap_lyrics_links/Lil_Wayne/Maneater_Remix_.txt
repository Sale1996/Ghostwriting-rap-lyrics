Take it back to the top

(lowered pitch)
Baby please don't eat me up, eat me up, eat me up
Baby please don't eat me up, eat me up, eat me up
Baby please don't eat me up, eat me up, eat me up
Baby please don't eat me up, eat me up, eat me up

[Lil Wayne]
See...

My shortie know what she doing
Lick her lips and get straight to it
When she do it, I say "Ooh it... feels so good"
"Ooh so good, you so good", I'm so hood
Take her to the block tell her don't even trip
I'ma stop right here, get a bag of that piff
We can roll it on up and take that lift
Hi, my name is Wayne I came to get paid
And lotta other miscellaneous things
Stand up guy but came to get laid
Where's my bed? What I said... is what I mean
And you can take that to the head
I just come to do my thing, gotta keep that maneater fed
Dreads swangin, while I'm bangin
When I'm finished, still bangin, yup!
I don't know what you was thinking
But I'm young and I been drinking, now
Hop on up in this spankin' new, drippin wet Mercedez coupe
Got the thang lookin like a shiney suit
Now imagine that with me and you
I be Diddy, you be Mase, eat me up enjoy the taste
If I be wit it, don't be faint
I'ma put it right there for you on that plate
Come on, call me Young Weezy Baby, Baby, ay-y-yes
I'm a m-m-mouthful now lemme see you digest

[Nelly Furtado]
And when she walks she walks with passion
When she talks, she talks like she can handle it
When she asks for something boy she means it
Even if you never ever see it
Everybody get your necks to crack around
All you crazy people come on jump around
You doing anything to keep her by your side
Because she said she love you, love you long time
(Come on now)

[Nelly Furtado] (Chorus)
Maneater, make you work hard
Make you spend hard
Make you want all, of her love
She's a maneater
Make you buy cars
Make you cut cards
Make you fall real hard in love
She's a Maneater, make you work hard
Make you spend hard
Make you want all, of her love
She's a maneater
Make you buy cars
Make you cut cards
Wish you never ever met her at all

[Timbaland (w/ Nelly Furtado chanting)]

(lowered pitch)
Baby please don't eat me up
Baby please don't eat me up
Baby please don't eat me up

[Nelly Furtado] (Chorus)
Maneater, make you work hard
Make you spend hard
Make you want all, of her love
She's a maneater
Make you buy cars
Make you cut cards
Make you fall real hard in love
She's a Maneater, make you work hard
Make you spend hard
Make you want all, of her love
She's a maneater
Make you buy cars
Make you cut cards
Wish you never ever met her at all

[Nelly Furtado] (Outro)
Never ever met her at all
You wish you never ever met her at all
You wish you never ever met her at all
You wish you never ever met her at all
You wish you never ever met her at all
You wish you never ever met her at all
You wish you never ever met her at all
You wish you never ever met her at all
