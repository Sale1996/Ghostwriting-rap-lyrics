[Intro: DJ Drama]
This level are greatness that we've achieved, has been earned
Many have tried, some succeeded, a lot have failed
Call us penthouse niggas! Top level shit!

[Lil Wayne]
Man all you pussy niggas drive me crazy
Make me sick to my stomach, I feel nauseated
All you haters hold hands and jump off a building
I could still taste her pussy, memorabilia
Backpack full of artillery, one me, no equivalent
These niggas actin' like lil bitches, I don't understand this shit like you scribbled it
Took her clothes, step back and exhibit it, then tear her ass up like a parkin' ticket
The end of the road is at walkin' distance, have to get that blood off my hands, left the faucet drippin'
In yo face like a airbag in a car collision, my weed man so consistent
I'm stayin rich, tryin not to make poor decisions, everything I do, I plan it out like a solar system
Nigga if you clumsy you gon slip and fall a victim to me, your bitch is sendin' naked pictures to me
Then she shoot over to my house, I scoot over in her bed, I shoot off in her mouth then she bit the bullet
Uh, skatin on 'em like Iâm Lil Wayne, and the weed so strong I can feel veins
Write it down, take a picture now I feel framed, the drugs got me so numb, I can't feel ashamed
And my girl at home with the mood swings, girl I gotta make a few runs like Usain
Wish I had a penny for my thoughts for some loose change, hungry niggas goin' at yo neck for that food chain
Pop some pills that make me sleepy, hoes, creep me, in they teepee
I hope that pussy, taste like kiwi, hope it's nicer than Tahiti, hopin' I could get a freebie
Leavin' a nigga body floatin with a mouth full of seaweed, what's in my Louis backpack? That's E.T.
Snitches give me the heebee, geebees, I hope they'll disappear, where the fuck is Houdini?
I got niggas on my side, you got niggas on yo back, I'ma yell "Timber", money grow on trees
Money over queens, fuck you blow me, I sit back enjoy the breeze, hoes prettier than please
I don't really do shit but sit back and call the shots, she poured out her heart, I had it on the rocks
Red beam on yo head, that's a cherry on top, you don't wanna keep your cool, I know niggas that'll die
Uh, I danced with the devil in my dreams, when I wake up, I still hear the same song
Make me wanna blow a motherfucker brains out, flood warnin' nigga, I'm about to brainstorm
Lil nigga Iâll take yo main hoe, take her call her homegirl, make 'em share the same dick
It's that motherfuckin "Dedication 5", I just hope I'll be alive to see a "Dedication 6"
Lil Tunechi.. whattup slime?

[Vado]
SLIIIME~!
Aiyyo it's levels to this shit, levels to this shit, been doin' MIA since "Levels" was the shit (yeah!)
And niggas know I'm on another level with this shit and pedalin' the six, full metal when it hit (huh)
All I need is a shovel and a ditch (yes) you done dig me a hole then you show me where it is (uh)
Run in his home and show me where the kids, put one in his dome while he goin' in his fridge (hah)
Thatâs me, him nigga (huh) black piece AP, gold trim nigga (yeah)
Black jeans, grey tee, old Timâs nigga (yeah) backstreet, everything go for ten nigga
Keep quiet, beef we deep fry it, I'm in the streets like Rodney King's riots (huh)
Mommy opposed their lead tight, on that old bullshit, Pete Myers
They screamin' seize fire, my audible like "Godfather" meets "Wire"
A felon in the whip, rollin 3-6s, devil yellin' trips (hah)
Shots whistled like a kettle when itâs lit, I'm tryin to go ballistic, shadow in the ship (uh-huh)
Called the Barney Rubble in the whip, made her kick rocks, blow haze from ziplocks
Uh

[Wayne] Whattup five?
