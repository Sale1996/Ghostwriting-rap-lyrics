[Chorus: Shanell]
I'm a thick motherfucker, I sit this on his lap
With my hand on his shooter, I lay them niggas back
Got somethin' for them niggas that react
I'm a bad motherfucker, I got this nigga's back

[Lil Wayne]
Whoa, she said "I know you ain't had yourself a good thick bitch in a minute
I saw some pictures of you boo'd up, it looks like you're startin' to like 'em skinny"
Hahah, I said "Girl, you're a trip", she said "I might be a trip but I ain't trippin'"
She said "Watch these hoes cause they leeches like robbin'", I said "No Robin Givens"
She was sittin' on my lap and you know a nigga strapped, I know she feel it
It's crazy out'chea, I'm just protectin' myself, you know I'm winnin'
She said "I get it and if anythin' was to happen to you I be livid"
You ain't gotta be worried 'bout that, I kill a pussy nigga, put his head on exhibit
Come up missin' think they caught a big fish 'til his body come up drippin'
I treat her legs like like a grand openin', smilin' while I cut the ribbon
I took a pill, she took a pill, we was chillin' twenty minutes now we feel it
She said "I know you probably hear this shit a lot but you the shit in my opinion"
I said it never gets old, thought I'd never say never but I did it
She said "Who you kiddin', boy? You like a thick bitch, big booty, big titties"
... I admit it!
Big booty, big titties, I admit it!

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
Yeah, I like my girls BBW
The type that wanna suck you dry then eat some lunch with you
She 'bout that foolishness, 'bout that trouble too
Yeah, booty on bubble, titties so fuckable
Ooh, hahaha, yeah

[Shanell]
Ooh, heyy
Okay, I know you ain't had yourself a good thick bitch in a minute
Saw a flick of ya boo'd up, boy you never liked them skinny
You tell me I'm a trip, well I might be a trip but I ain't trippin'
I'm just sayin' ohhh-ahh
Boy this here will keep you warm at night
Feed you good before you catch a flight
Stop actin' like you ain't got no type
Who you kiddin'?

[Lil Wayne]
I admit it... yeah, I admit it
But I got these guns on me right now, I got these drugs on me right now
I got the feds on me right now, I got two buyers who want it right now
She took her clothes off and I stopped, looked at my watch like "Fuck it, why not?"
Guess I could fuck her once then I'm out, fucked so many times a nigga lost count, Lord
Woo, she said "I know you thought that you was about to get a quick fix, hit and quit it
But you know you ain't been with a good thick bitch in a minute"
I said "You ain't never lyin', thought I'd never say never but I did it"
She said "Speakin' of a line, are you finished? All we need is a witness"
Girl you trippin', young nigga still livin'
She said "Who you kiddin' boy, you like a thick bitch, big booty, big titties"

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne - over Chorus]
Big booty, big titties
I admit it, I like a thick bitch - big booty, big titties
I admit it, woo!
I admit it, thick bitch, big booty, big titties

[Lil Wayne]
I like my girls BBW
The type that wanna suck you dry then eat some lunch with you
She 'bout that foolishness, 'bout that trouble too
Yeah, booty so huggable, titties so fuckable
I mean that
