[Euro]
Yeah, it's Euro nigga, hahahah
(D5!) Huh

I'm that Dominican nigga, your bitch be talkin' 'bout
I'm in a different city, you can fuck her now
I got a whole collection, of my hoe collection
YMCMB, no autocorrection
I said "Fuck all y'all niggas, except my niggas"
Security don't check my niggas, all y'all niggas gon' respect my niggas
Either that or get a whack or get a bat to the back of the neck, my nigga
Yeah that shorty with y'all with y'all cause she never met a big dog 'til she met my niggas
Got a big dream, from a small town, got a small circle, you never get around
Old hoes thinkin' I'm a put 'em on now, room full of bad bitches, I'm a put 'em all down
Always been broke, who's rich now? I ain't never had change, why switch now?
Money talks nigga, I ain't never heard shit 'til y'all heard me spit now everything loud
Got a mojo with a flow-flow, got a whole load, don't know if it's a promo
Never cuff hoes, hell no that's a no-no, coolin' in the cut with a bud sippin' Romo
Ah! No love for the po-po's, gotta pour more for my niggas in the hell hole
Never tell though, I'm a need a little more dope for my uncle cause I sell flows and he sell dope
Nigga work

[Interlude: Mack Maine]
Yeah, Euro
Whattup, this Mack the fortune teller
The nigga that put y'all on Miley Cyrus
Negrodamus, my nigga, predictin' futures
You need some lottery numbers, holla at me nigga, I got you

[Jae Millz]
(OWWW!)
Put a nigga in that hearse, long ass K, no nina
Word to Martin, I'm cold with this homie, buckshots like Pam make a nigga say "Damn Gina!" (Millzy!)
Money don't mean nothin', my youngin', I'll kill you for some sneakers (bow!)
This Dedication 5, no vacations slime, we in the end zone and they in bleachers
Cheerleaders, we ain't worried 'bout nothin', nothin'; nigga act dumb, push the button, fuck 'em
Get 'em out of here like the 6th foul in the NBA, lil nigga no discussion
Boy I'll close ya case like judge Mills Lane, all y'all wack ass niggas stay out of Millz lane
Big guns that go over the shoulder dawg; my team strapped, no overalls
So please don't make me do it, got soldiers and shooters, these bullets will swallow like shots of Kahlua
When we light up the weed then we fly like a rumor then hop on the plane and fly over you losers
Put racks on your head now you sleep in the sewer, I'm not from this era that beef on computers
Look boy if it's war, then all we comin' after you, specially I'm smashin ya, somethin' like Gallagher
Shots in your challenger, shots in your passenger, hittin' your girl then I'm passin' her
Jae Millz ain't worried 'bout nothin', Young Money ain't worried 'bout nothin'
D5!

We ain't worried 'bout nothin' (Young Money) nigga we ain't worried 'bout nothin' (Jae Millz)
Nigga we ain't worried 'bout nothin' (not a thing) nigga we ain't worried 'bout nothin' (D5)
