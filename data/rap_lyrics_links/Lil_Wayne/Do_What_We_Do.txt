(Chorus)
I don't know bout you but a my girlfriend, got a girlfriend
My girlfriend, got a girl and we do, do, do, do, do what we do
Do, do, do, do, do what we do
My girlfriend, got a girlfriend, we do, do, do, do, do what we do
Do, do, do, do, do, what we do

[Verse 1]
You know me, young f hoe
I get's all in her mouth like strep throut
I get's all in her belly like Pepto
Straight stompin' in that pussy like a step show
Ghetto vets keep me with 'em like lip glow
College bitches keep me with 'em like cliff notes
Cold bitches keep me with 'em like thick coats
Two foreign bitches now, thats a mix show
Pull your skirt up and let your lips show
She fell in love with a stripper at the strip show
And now its two bitches and me, two bitches and me
Two bitches and me

(Chorus)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I like long hair, I hate make up
Fuck my pillows up, fuck is really up
I like slim chicks' I love thick broads
All the bitches love me, I need a thick guard
And if she don't give head she's a nimrod
Bitch i'll never put your number on my sim card
I look at MJG and 8 Ball as mentors
All they told me was to pimp hard
Pimp harder, I get head and tail like a quarter
Yep, yeah in that order
Two bitches and me, two bitches and me

(Chorus)

[Verse 3]
Two bitches and me, two bitches and me
Two bitches and me, two bitches and me
And they kissin' and huggin', they kissin' and huggin'
They kissin' and huggin', they kissin' and huggin'
Hello, I can play with it, I can beat it up
Yep beat it up, get your pussy lip bust
Wait, she said she wanna know how pussy taste
She wanna suck dick, while she get her pussy ate
Ha, movies, massage, manage, bedroom
Bathroom, garage, goodbye, haha, just leave me be
And it was just us three, two bitches and me 

(Chorus)
