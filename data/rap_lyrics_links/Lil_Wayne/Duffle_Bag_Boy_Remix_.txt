[Lil Wayne - talking]
And if you can't feel it I'ma touch ya
Nothin' makes a situation better than chedda
And I'm cuttin' through that cheese like a shredda
So I guess I'm famous like a Nanja Turtle
But I ain't got nothin', nothin' but money
Cuz if I don't do, if I don't do

[Hook 1]
If I don't do nothin' I'ma ball
I'm countin' all day like the clock on the wall
Now go and get ya money lil' duffle bag boy
Say go and get ya money lil' duffle bag boy  (Remix baby) (Get money)
I ain't never ran from a nigga
and I damn sho' ain't bout to pick today to start runnin' (Remix baby)
Look honey, I ain't never ran from a nigga
and I damn sho' ain't bout to pick today to start runnin' (Get money)

[Lil Wayne Verse]
The block is hot, the flow is so ice cold
Walkin' into the bank, honey I am home
I get more that shit, ya got me dancin' on
Anotha planet to screw, Janet Jackson song
I talk real crazy, but they still pay me
Said goodbye to the game, but I'm still wavin'
And no disrespect to the lil' ladies
But fuck nine months, I hustle all year baby
All yeah baby, I know you lovin' that
Thee be where the d be, dope boy wit a duffle bag
Wit a duffle bag til they put it in the air
Call me Mr. President or call me Mr. Ever Care
Or Mr. Everywhere or Mr. Never Care
Or Mr. Never Scared, no you could never scare
Me, yeah me in the kitchen wit that big pot
Bitch I'm on my, bitch I'm on my tank top, tick tock

[Hook 1]
If I don't do nothin' I'ma ball
I'm countin' all day like the clock on the wall
Now go and get ya money lil' duffle bag boy
Say go and get ya money lil' duffle bag boy  (Remix baby) (Get money)
I ain't never ran from a nigga
and I damn sho' ain't bout to pick today to start runnin' (Remix baby)
Look honey, I ain't never ran from a nigga
and I damn sho' ain't bout to pick today to start runnin'
(New Playaz Circle) (Get money)

[Playaz Circle - Dolla Boy)
Hail to the streets, cuz the streets is what made me
Still the same I hate hoes and they hate me
If a nigga owe me, believe he gon pay me
I signed wit Def Jam but I don't know Jay-Z
Beat the, beat the death like Weezy F Baby

Duffle bag boys Dolla Tit ya wanna meet the rest
Big Cap, J dot
Beats that's hot

[Playaz Circle - Tity Boi]
Yes I am a beast
Feed me rappers or feed me beats

[Juelz Santana]
Ok Dipset, Santana, let's go, ya dig?
Aye I push those whips, pass those hoes
Got a money overload, my duffle bag won't close (uh oh)
I'm driving by, you just standin' starrin'
We flyin' high, you just prepare for landin'
I'm so fresh from my stitchin' to my belt
From my jewels to my shoes, I take pictures of myself (Cheese)
And that money's my wife, she ain't signin' a prenup
She gon love me for life, (why) cuz I know how to treat her

[Birdman]
Stunnaman so I'm headin' to the Phantmon shop

Took a Jet to Jersey on Ms. Lee's island
You know me homey, bout this money I'm pilin'

Ready spray
