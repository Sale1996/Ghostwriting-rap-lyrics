(Verse 1)
[Mannie Fresh]
This is for
Deshawn, Eshlawn, Lil Mam, and her friends
Lisa, Teresa, Maria, Tia, Lia and Kim
I love y'all broads, no disrespect to my dawgs, but
I love y'all broads
Yeah, I love y'all broads
To the ladies, havin' babies, without no drama
To my {*niggas*}, with figures, say, "I love my baby momma"
I bought them shoes, them tattoos, and even fixed your breasts
I put you inside, the fliest ride, put a "S" on your chest

[Lil Wayne]
This is for the
Ones who wobbled it, and be puttin' they {*mouth on it and they*}
Suck everything out of it, then they catch it and swallow it
I'm Lil Weezy, fa sheezy, I'm off the heezy, believe me, see me
I squeeze in between it, and then I leave it so greasy
When I come through in a Rolls Royce
Leave 'em with no choice
But to hop up in it, then just let me make they throat moist
Ruby red and vodka, it just carry a {*nigga*}
Give me three minutes, maybe four, she be wantin' to marry a {*nigga*}
What

Chorus: Juvenile
Give me a project chick
Give me a hood rat trick
One that don't give a (What)
And say, she took that stick
Give me a project trick
Give me a hood rat chick
One that don't give a (What)
And say, she took that stick

[Verse 2: Juvenile]
My momma send me by my grandma, my grandma flipped out
And said, "We ain't gone have no evil in this house"
So I rolled out
Got me a bag to sell out
But I messed up
When I started livin' in these female's house
I laid there, started lovin' the broad
Cause she was treatin' whoody real good
And breakin' me off
Lettin' me hum
On her chest and tongue
She was still-un
I spared her cause of her children
She was a freak, she had no business by the building
Went sellin' records
But her mouth, could sell a million
If you wanna take it there, we can break it off 
Cause y'all body ain't got Lil Whoody tweakin' at all
I slang this here, summer, winter, spring, and the fall
Ask me, "Lay it down"
I'm bringin' it all
I'm tryin' to {*hit ya*} from the back til ya holla, "Good lord!"
Man, Juve do it good and it always be hard

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 3: Baby]
Whoody, could catch me reed up
Them white folks know the code so we G'd up
And my Range Rover four-door be D'd up
Tattoos and new cars in these project cuts
Got this clown trick I know I been wantin' to pluck
I deal with gangstas, thugs, and broads that give it up
So project bosses, I'm reppin' and I'm steppin'
Find me and Lil Weezy in a four-door Lexus
I got a broad shoot dice
A broad that ain't right
Got a broad who'd give you work, for a real good price
I got a credit card broad
A scam type broad
A fraud type broad, like to snort that boy
Got a Magnolia pro
A Melpomene pro
A real solid broad out that Cali, yo
I got this brat type chick, like to whine and shhh
Got this project clique like to start some shhh

Repeat Chorus Til Fade
