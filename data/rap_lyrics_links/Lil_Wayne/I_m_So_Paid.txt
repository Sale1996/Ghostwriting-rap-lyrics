[Intro: Akon]
Rubbin on that Italian leather
Them Konvict jeans on
You ready? (Yeah!) {Yeah}
Geah! Konvict

[Chorus: Akon] + (Jeezy)
I get it in 'til the sunrise (AY)
Doin 90 in the 65 (AY)
Windows rolled down screamin out
Ay, ay, ay, I'm so paid
Number one hustler gettin money (AY)
Why you wanna count my money (AY)
I'm a hustler, don't need nann one of y'all
You see, I'm so paid

[Akon]
I see police on that crooked I
Doin a hundred on Interstate 95
My shorty leanin, blastin that Do or Die
Wishin that motherfucker would cause we certified
Got a system that'll beat and knock your wall off
Got a pump under my seat, the sawed-off
Got a bunch of goons, hope to never call on
I'm a sniper sittin on the roof already saw y'all
It ain't too much to put a strain on me
That's the reason why I had to put the blame on me
I'd rather have them dollar bills rain on me
than to let them haters come and make a name off me
That's why

[Chorus] w/ Jeezy ad libs

[Young Jeezy]
She said, "Young, why your voice so hoarse?"
I just sound like money baby I shoulda been a Porsche
Paint lookin like a sugar-free Red Bull
I'm so paid, you know I keep a pocketful
Ha ha, and that's before the taxes
Took my whole gross, now they hid it under my mattress
I used to get bored, count 20's for practice
Paper therapy, we let the money relax us
Gold chains 'round my neck just like Michael Phelps
I made a killin in the water, killin with the water
Against all odds and I will not stop
They tried keep me on bottom but I prefer the top
And my project chick I moved her next to Joc
She said the house was too small, I moved her next the block
So baby get ya ass up, I need an extra block
I told her "Do the speed limit, no extra stops"
And that's why

[Chorus] w/ Jeezy ad libs

[Akon]
I'm the boss, it only takes one call
To try to hit you up and dump you off and that's all
Guess what? I won't be takin that fall
Homie I got cake, that's what I'm payin them for
Ha ha, ain't that funny?
Guerillas they want war, but ain't got money
Cause I seen them all talk until they start gunnin
Quicker than Usain Bolt, the fastest thing runnin
Yeah, Akon, Weezy (Jeezy)
Block Royal holdin down Jersey (Jersey)
Devyne makin sure we gettin it +Up Front+
My lil' brother Boo got that vision, baby

[Chorus] w/ Wayne ad libs

[Lil Wayne]
Ah-umm, big money Weezy
White wife beater with the sig' underneath it
How do I feel? Bitch I feel undefeated
Snap my fingers disappear from the precinct
Yeah, I'm ballin, we ball out
Ball 'til we fall until the ball bounce
I send some niggaz with guns to y'all house
Only to find out you live in a dollhouse
Damn (damn) but I thought you was tough though
We carry choppers on our necks, call it cutthroat
We bury cowards on the set that they come from
We know magic, turn weed smoke to gun smoke
WE (we) ball first when we ride
You (you) in a hearse when you ride
(Ayyyy) I put my shoe down baby
And I'm holdin down Young Moolah baby (that's whyyyy)

[Chorus]
