[Intro: Swizz Beatz]
'Scuse me Travis Barker you're on
Uh-uh-on, uh-uh-on
I been waitin so don't take too long
Uh-uh-on...

[Chorus: Swizz Beatz]
Can a drummer get some? Can a drummer get some?
Can a drummer get some? Can a drummer get some?
Can a - can a drummer get, can a - can a drummer get
Can a - can a drummer get (can a drummer get some?)

[Game]
Boom, guess who stepped in the room?
Draped in black diamonds like a fuckin monsoon
Back from the dead but they never found my killer
So I jumped up out the grave like Michael Jackson in "Thriller"
Iller, than most MC's cause I be killin the most MC's
Turn 'em to ghost MC's
Yeah, give the drummer some.. {*drumroll*}
As the 32's spin when that all-black Hummer run
+Face/Off+, Nicolas Cage with a guage
I'm famous for killin rappers, my style, grenade
Cook shit like Ray, the Chef Raekwon
The beats are filet mignon without the A1
Who bark like a pitbull, you? Bitch please
I eat your favorite rapper's heart out with a sixteen
Dean hit the switch, I'm somethin with big D's
Make money with Ruff Ryders, homie that's Swizz cheese

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
Bang, guess who checked in the game?
Smoke in the air like LeBron James
Runnin this shit like he Ron Dayne
Pull out my dick and just pee on flames
She on Wayne, but she ain't what I be on
I'm beyond, I pee on you peons for eons
I'm in my prime like Deion
I'ma shine like neon, I'm a lion like Leon
But I'm about to go off, cause that is all I know of
I don't have to show y'all, I'd rather show off
Yeah, Travis on the drums, Travis on the beat
Wayne got the smoke, and Game got the heat
Weezy F, I'm a F'n star
Haha, get it? F and Star?
Ha, and it's the Roc you bastards
If I'm the rock star we'll ROCK you bastards

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
Boss, Black Wall Street
Maybach Music

2Pac in "Juice," Radames is on the loose
King James 'round my neck, haters wish it was a noose
Long Maybach and I wish it was a coupe
Kush out the jar, car smellin like Joop
Quarter milli on the seat, yeah I know I'm a goof
Designer underwear, she knows I'm the Gucc'
Got the wide body, I'm a fat motherfucker
In Swahili I'm screamin "Stack motherfucker~!"
Yeah homie won't stop until I decide to
Until then I'm makin rollies for the homies to ride to
Spokes on the fo's, folks wanna know
Bitch I'm the Boss, best foot's on the blow
Keep the hat pulled low, big P on the front
Travis on the drums, big weed on the blunt
Think savage where I'm from, girls manage from the jump
Don't try me like a punk, Travis handin me the pumps
So {*echoes*}

[Chorus] - 2X
