[Lil Wayne]
Let go, okay
Bitch I'm me, American gangster
Weezy F baby, born in a manger
Trouble is my friend I ain't foreign to danger
Clip full of wings turn you boys into angels
Shoot ya in your halo, shoot you like Halo
New Orleans A-hole, frio, fuego
All about my bread like bagels, they know
I'm Raw like qualudes, ball like gay hoes
Weed so strong its like I twist tornados
Spit like nines, fo'-fifths and three-eight-ohs
Niggaz want problems well I am problematic
It's back to pickin cotton cause you niggaz cotton candy
I'ma Eastside Damu, deep water Shamu
Shoot you from your head to your shoulders, shampoo
Kush and the bamboo, pussy in the bedroom
Pass that bitch down like an heirloom, too cheap
Hold up, hold up wait a minute
Hold up, hold up mannnnnn

[Chorus]
We hustle 'til nightfall, party 'til sunlight
Guns in the boxers, don't make this a gun fight
Fuck them other niggaz, fuck them niggaz bitches
Benadryl shit, trigger finger itchin and
we hustle 'til nightfall, party 'til sunlight
Guns in the boxers, don't make this a gun fight
Fuck them other niggaz, and fuck them niggaz bitches
Benadryl shit, trigger finger itchin
Hold up, hold up... wait a minute
Hold up, hold up... haha

[T-Streets]
Man bitch I'm Streets, I rep that East
Gi-gimme the beef I'll put the beef in the grease
Kush and the sweets, your bitch in the sheets
I fucked that bitch, mi-mission complete
Real nigga talk, gangster conversation
I'm a real nigga, don't fuck wit imitations
Young Money nigga, ain't no limitations
I don't play games, nigga simulations
Which one of y'all niggaz say you 'bout it?
It's a fucked up world, T-Streets take you out it
That's word to the glock, glock in the sock
Loose lips sink ships better stop at the dock
Hold up~!

[Lil Wayne]
Uhh married to the money you welcome to the reception
And she came with problems, fuck it that's my stepsons
Sleepin in the Maybach, wake me when the jet come
And I keep the toast, turn yo' ass to breadcrumbs
Uhh.. based on a true story
I got a million flows they ain't even two stories
Sleepin on the edge, I hope I don't toss and turn
Shoot down the early bird and that's how I get the worm
Yeah, re-real Nigga University, alumni
Just checked my watch and that bitch says sometimes
She say when I'm in her, it feel like I'm soul searchin
And they say money talks, well it's my spokesperson
Uhh, grab a star from the sunroof
I fuck her in her dreams, and make her come true
Yeah, Young Money and the power
Send my bees at you like a muh'fuckin flower
Hold up, hold up
Hold up, wait a minute
Hold up... hold up, mannn

[Chorus]
