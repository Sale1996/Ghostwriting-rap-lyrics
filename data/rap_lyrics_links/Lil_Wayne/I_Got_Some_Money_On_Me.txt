[Lil Wayne]
I got some money on me, I'm 'bout to kill these hoes
I don't be politickub, I'm not political
Fuck you talkin' bout, bitch I'm Kenneth Cole
My goons masked up, +Rey Mysterio+
Bitch eat somethin, I don't like skinny hoes
I hit her from the back, she on her tippie toes
I smoke that +Green Day+, I'm on my Billie Joe
I'm a dog bitch, B-I-N-G-O
I'm a rich ass nigga, you bitch ass nigga
I'm from the school of hard knocks, you skip class nigga
Tell her bust that pussy open, bend it over, bring it back
Get some brain out that hoe and call that hoe a Brainiac

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I got some money on me, I'm 'bout to kill these hoes
I got some money on me, I'm 'bout to kill these hoes
Fuck you talkin 'bout? Bitch I'm Kenny Cole
I'm a dog bitch, B-I-N-G-O
Every bad bitch love me, I'm Young Money
Tell 'em pop that pussy for me, pop that pussy for me
And my niggaz got the guns, they aimin for ya skully
Tell 'em pop that pussy for me, pop that pussy for me

[Birdman]
Uptown gangster life!
Made man, +5 Star+ nigga
Ya understand me, give a hundred
and hundreds, one hundred

[Lil Wayne]
Yeah; if you a bad bitch, say fuck them other hoes
I'm in my lane bitch, you a gutter bowl
Boogers in the watch, it got a runny nose
I like a pink pussy, just like a bunny nose
And we are Young Money, the untouchables
I hit her from the back, I make her touch her toes
I'm on that drink baby, I think I'm comotosed
I'm feelin real good, Stevie Wonder-ful
And e'rybody with me strapped, tell them hoes adapt
Shoot 'em in his head he dead before he collapse
Young Money we the crap, no salary cap
Money talks bitch and mines yap yap yap

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I got some money on me, I'm 'bout to kill these hoes
I got some money on me, I'm 'bout to kill these hoes
If you a bad bitch, say fuck them other hoes
I'm feelin real good, Stevie Wonder-ful
And we don't talk about it, we do it do it nigga
Shit can get ugly, Patrick Ewing nigga
Them niggaz can't see me, but I see through them niggaz
And fuck the police, on or off duty nigga

[Birdman]
Yeah~! Young Money gunners
Cash Money Mobsters
Hittin shots, one up top
Top flo', brrap

[Lil Wayne]
Alright, alright!! Uhh
I'm on some other shit, I'm stuntin on them hoes
Bitch I'm smokin pot, like I'm on the stove
I'm in this bitch bitch, I'm so Holly Grove
Them hoes treasure me, like a pot of gold
Boy you thin crust, fuckin Dominos
I'm laughin to the bank, this shit is comical
We do it real big, astronomical
I make her fall for me, bitch Geronimo
Now get it poppin for a nigga, whow me what you're workin with
I'm fly as a motherfucker bitch, no turbulence
Please know my niggaz got them pistols for emergencies
I'm lookin for a head doctor for some brain surgery

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Some money on me, I'm 'bout to kill these hoes
I got some money on me, I'm 'bout to kill these hoes
I'm laughin to the bank, this shit is comical
I make her fall for me, bitch Geronimo
Fifty shots in the chopper, break 'em off proper
You niggaz can't see me, fuck yo' binoculars~!
I'ma coconut Ciroc'er, a beast like Chewbacca
I'm runnin this shit, I don't even need blockers

[Lil Wayne]
Uh-huh, alright {*3X*}
Alright, alright - yeah

[Birdman - over Wayne]
Priceless, fresh off an island
Hundred mill, bitch we the bid'ness
+5 Star+ gangsta, moolah crazy

[Lil Wayne]
I got some money on me, I'm 'bout to kill these hoes
I got some money on me, I'm 'bout to kill these hoes
