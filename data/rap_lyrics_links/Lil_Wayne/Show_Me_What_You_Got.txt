[Introduction]
This Is a public service announcement
Lil Wayne, Weezy F Baby IS the best rapper alive
Hit me, haha, good mornin' New York
Good afternoon New Orleans
Goodnight America haha yeah

[Chorus]
Doe is what I got, little mama
Doe is what I got, bird lady
Doe is what I got, shorty
Doe is what I got, baby
Come on, I'm paid, I'm paid, I'm paid, I'm paid

[Verse]
Hay, give a women none, uh uh
I already gave my brother some
It's my sisters turn, ain't it funny how the fish do burn
But your boy just relax like a fresh new perm
As the world of the barrel of the pistol turn
But we get it how we live never live and learn
Got to talk about the flow cause you is concerned
Only down south could of been in a firm
Ah, the commission of Wu-Tang nigga
Tryin to tell you I can kick like Liu Kang nigga
Got that Sub-Zero flow how you want me mine
Nigga get it over here like Scorpion
And when it comes down to this recordin
I must be LeBron James or be Jordan
No, I want rings with my performance
I'm more Kobe Bryant up in all this
Same coat, same gang been startin
Same triangle office, I come through the lane like a dargeant
Referee niggas is lame they call Jargeant
I have no brain, I'm retarted
We all not the same, I'm a martian
You can be my Jane, I'm your Tarzan
I'm from the jungle where the snakeses are all poison
I'am magnificant like Marcus
You might wanna fall back like August
Or lace up Timber or whatever you call it
I hit niggas in the head like Vonage
I'am talkin to no particular audience
But understand I'm the the guardian
And understand there wont be no guardin' him
But you just get played like an accordin'
I dont give a damn if she's bossit
I keep pussy runnin' like a faucet
She better catch light shes Steve Logdit
Because I'm WHAT'S UP like Martin

Haha wooo yeah see
I know yall talk about me an an
You dont like what you hear sometime
Um um since im so bright im a put the spot light on you baby

[Chorus Part 2]
Show me what you bout little daddy
I know what you need to stop, stop hatin
I know what your not, wodie
And that is Weezy baby
Blunts up, now blaze, hay blaze, hay blaze, hay blaze

I'm workin yeah
Tell em where I take six
Young dictionary make words make sense
