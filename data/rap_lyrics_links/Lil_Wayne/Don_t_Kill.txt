[Drama] A dedication...

"GANGSTA!" {*echoes*}

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
And if I fuck her, she gon' get attached
Who invited all these fuck niggas?
Man, shit ain't ever smell this good
Why them snakes tryin' to tongue kiss us?
Way too cool to die young, way too young to die sober
Way too cool to die young, way too young to die sober
Sleepin' with a bad bitch, wake me up when it's all over
I'm so tired of these niggas, wake me up when it's all over

[Lil Wayne]
Bitch come kill my time, but bitch don't steal my shine
I'm cookin' up two quarters, 'bout to get rich or die tryin'
I got some killers on my side, some killer up in my swisher
All this hatin' drive me crazy, take the key out the ignition
Oh my God, it feel like Coogi weather
I lost my mind, but I got it +Back+ like +Groovy+ +Stella+
Tell them hoes I got that Victoria Secret weapon
I hope you live a double life cause you gon' need an extra
Me and my niggas, we got bad bitches up in the pool, bad bitches up in the pool
She gon' learn tonight, call that shit night school
And life is a bitch on her cycle, delightful
Got hoes on that powder like light blue, nice move
Now king me nigga, bad ass bitch, you seen me with her
We on that, GT Vodka, straight out the bottle, genie nigga
The difference between me and these niggas is I go hard and they go wrong
She say "Hit it from the back", I'm tryin' to leave that crack alone baby

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
And if she love me, I'm a love her back
Who indictin' all the tough niggas?
We smoke that skunk that's always smellin' good
But why these snakes tryin' to tongue kiss us?
Way too cool to die young, way too young to die sober
Way too cool to die young, way too young to die sober
Sleepin' with a bad bitch, wake me up when it's all over
I'm so tired of these niggas, wake me up when it's all over

[Lil Wayne]
Street sweepers and millimeters, AK's and skateboards
Let 'em know we got beef for anyone who got a taste for it
Real nigga to the bone bristle, cocaine like co-cripple
Heard niggas been waitin' on me, well I might as well go and tip 'em
I'm smokin' on that Hulk Hogan, I call shots, you call forward
I pimp my ride, my car's hoin' and all my bars be barcoded
These YMCMB stars glowin', hate a hoe nigga like anchovies
My young bitch keep on snappin' on me, I told that bitch I ain't posin'
That pussy feel like a pot of gold, the money old and the night is young
All them niggas keep talkin' shit, I make you eat your words and bite your tongue
And when the guns ring I'm the ring leader, got those hoes on pins and needles
I'm so high I left Earth, and ran into Venus and Serena
Get head like a mindreader, you washed up, I'm the dry cleaner
Don't worry about me, nigga I'm one-hundred like a high fever
Got pounds takin' up closet space, guns all in my bitch crib
Since all you nigga's fly now, bugs all on my windshield

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Uhh, and if she tense then I'm a rub her back
Hah, she alright, I think I fuck with her
Man, I wish a motherfucker would/wood
I feel like a hockey puck nigga
Way too cold to die young, way too young to die sober
Way too cold to die young, give these niggas the cold shoulder
Sleepin' with a bad bitch, another bitch when I roll over
We fuck until we fall asleep, wake up and do it all over

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Uhh! D5, whattup five?
Kendrick - whattup five?
