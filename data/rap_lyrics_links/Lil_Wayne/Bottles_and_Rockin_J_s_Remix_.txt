[Busta Rhymes]
Aiyyo Game I wanna talk right now
I-I wanna let niggaz know what I know

All I know is how to smash on everybody record and do what I do
and make somebody have to go and get a hearse
Yo Game, I don't really give a fuck if it's your record
and you my brother my nigga, look I gotta rhyme first
See the way I come and how I do the game (church!)
Ask somebody, you gotta know you need to get a nurse
Let me bang 'em with another killa
then we put a couple bottles on the chiller, kill 'em with another verse
Everybody see the way I be goin and goin, how I do it?
Niggaz don't even be knowin, but then again yes they do be knowin
how I be bangin in every shit I be givin you
All the heat I be packin and I be showin off
With all this money you know where I'm headin
and I'm gonna get the Jordan's, the patent leather 11's
They really bangin all the way down to the beddin
and I get a couple pair with all this money I be gettin
And I kill 'em with the bop, see the way a nigga steppin
and we pop bottles and we rock J's - see me reppin?
And respect the way I do it 'fore I hit you with the weapon
Don't be spillin liquor all over my shit, give me a second
Damn~! (SHIIIIIT!!) Anyway, see we gotta get it up
Probably fill a model up, let me rev a bottle up
Let me see everybody put your liquor bottles up 
{"Maybach Music"} LET'S GO!

[Rick Ross]
Bitches I'm gettin money (woo!) bottles and rockin chains (uh)
Money like I'm LeBron (woo!) my whip collection insane
Suicidal thoughts (uh) highway to Heaven ridin like a boss
Condominium in the clouds, 60 G's a month (ha ha ha)
Fifty floors, marble walls, pictures of Boston George
Bitches snortin blow, fuckin fast and cookin dope (woo!)
Sanctify, Bally shoes, Audemars, Francky Muller 
That Chopard, my new bitches must m√©nage, I'm a G

[Chorus: Teyana Taylor]
You can find me in the stoooooo' (woo!) spendin money (woo!)
All up in the cluuuuuuub (woo!) throwin hundreds
In my J's, J's, J's, J's
I be in my J's, J's, J's, J's
You can find me in the stoooooo' (woo!) spendin money (woo!)
All up in the cluuuuuuub (woo!) throwin hundreds
We don't play, play, play, play
When it comes to the J's, J's, J's, J's

[Game]
Bottles and rockin J's, smokin and sippin Spades
Pistol tucked in my Louie, +Heat+'d up like I'm Wade
Nigga don't do LeBron's, Kobe up on the weekend
Jordan's Monday through Friday especially when I'm freakin
Them cool grays that's Monday, them Space Jams that's Tuesday
Them Spike Lee's on Wednesday, 23's on my Benz - AY!
You know I love them 6's, especially on my bitches
13's and them spandex on Thursday, it's your birthday
And Friday I ain't lyin, King Of Diamonds I'm in heaven
Redbone pussy poppin on my black and red 11's
Patent leather when I step in, you know what I'm reppin
S-double O, W-double O
Black number fo's, I ain't get it from the sto'
Bust' know...

[Chorus]

[Fabolous]
I put footprints in them couches, I put so much in my two-step
Put on fo' my city, I ain't got no choice but to rep
I put straight shots, in they hand, make pretty girls do the ugly face
And they just put my song on, move back, I need Dougie space 
Like "AY, AY!" Then it's right back to my muggin face
Niggaz said put the weed out, BBM, you buggin face
We walked in, one some'n, bottles pop like we won some'n
Raise a glass for e'rybody that's done +Somethin, From Nothin+
No grind, no shine, dress code, we pay no mind
Cargos and J's on, they let son/sun in, no blinds
All I drink is my shit, stop playin, YouTube (Loso so wasted!)
But tonight we on that red berry and cranberry, SOO-WOO!

[Lil Wayne]
And I'm smokin on that purp, sippin on that purp
I came in this bitch, with some niggaz that will murk
And we ain't 'bout all that talkin, you a dead man walkin
Stomp a nigga ass out, in these number 4 Jordan's
Got a scope, on the barrel, that's a hammer with a camera
Hollow-tips nigga, tip a nigga like a dancer
I don't know nuttin but bitches and gettin money
Blood Gang, kill a nigga in public, YOUNG TUNECHI~!
Shoot a nigga ass up then it's deuces!
Head shots, that fuckin vest is so useless!
Yeahhhh! Yo Chuck, FUCK these niggaz!
You know who, P-I-RU, killer bees nigga!
WOW~! YOUNG MULA BAY-BAAAAAY!!

[Chorus]
