[Intro: August Alsina]
Kissin' on me, kissin' on me {*4X*}

[Lil Wayne]
New Orleans boys, you heard me

I got that ratchet on me, few pills on me, a young bitch with no miles on her
She don't suck dick then I don't want her cause I know I'ma go down on her
I know she think I'ma throw thous on her, I'ma kill that pussy throw flowers on her
Act like it's mine like I'm a proud owner, then I'ma get ghost town on her
I'ma give her head 'til her toes curl, we gon' conversate, we gon' soul search
She asked if I fucked her homegirl, I froze up, it's a cold world
I smoke fat blunts and white boys, no pun intended
It ain't no fun if the homies can't have none, she stingy
If she nasty she get commended, if she classy she get suspended
If she passive freak and friendly and she bring something to swim in
Then bitch get on my wave, bitch get on my wave
She kiss me on my tats, and I kiss her on her cat
Tunechi

[August Alsina]
Baby I don't blame you
For bein' in the clubs and gettin' all that love
Cause you're so beautiful
God made you to show that off, ohh
Now I ain't ever been the jealous type of guy
But I want you to myself, mm, I can't lie
I know we ain't on no one-on-one thing
But baby, it should change

[Interlude: August Alsina]
Cause when I be out with other chicks, I be thinkin' 'bout you
And when you be out on dates, you be texting me too
Tellin' me to come pick you up when he drop you off
I pray to God he ain't breakin' you off, off-off-off-off

[Chorus: August Alsina]
I don't want nobody but you, kissin' on my tattoos
I don't want nobody but me (talkin to you) until you fall asleep
We better stop playin' (we better stop playin')
Before we mess around and someone gets hurt
I don't want nobody but you (nobody but you) kissin' on my tattoos
Nobody but you - kissin' on me, kissin' on me {*4X*}

[August Alsina]
All my homies wanna know what's up with us
They can't believe that I'm kickin' it with just one girl
But I'm cool with that (I'm cool with that) them pretty eyes and that smile
Girl I'm a fool for that (yeah I'm a fool for that)

[Interlude] + [Chorus]

[screwed voice - w/ August Alsina ad-libs]
K-I-S-S-I-N-G on my T-A-T-T-O-O-S {*4X*}
