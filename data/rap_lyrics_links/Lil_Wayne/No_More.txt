I got the brown bag full of money
I got the work goin to florida
and I swore that I won't ever hustla no more
but I don't never say that no more got my mind
right nah

I got the brown bag full of money
I got the work goin to florida and I swore
that I won't ever hustla no more
but I don't never say that no more got my mind
right money right

The pots hot as the rock expands it the paper chasin
man on the clock like hands grindin
like teeth get money like heath cliff hukstable keep it comin
like keith gotta meke last forever for worse
or for better gotta make it past the devil
so guns I got several and everybody plays the fool says aaron
nevelle but I just play to win holler back like heavy metal
smellin like pedals from a rose so they hoes
my breads buildin bagels and legos when I rose
they froze trust me for the pesos I'm an a hole AK holes
think face blow and understand talkin money
by the case loads gun off safety I'm in safe mode
I will hold court until the case closed
brown bag bitch

I got the brown bag full of money
I got the work goin to florida
and I swore that I won't ever hustla no more
but I don't never say that no more got my mind
