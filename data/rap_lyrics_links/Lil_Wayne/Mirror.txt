[Lil Wayne]
With everything happening today
You don't know whether you're comin or goin
But, you think that you're on your way
Life lined up on the mirror don't blow it
Woo~! Look at me when I'm talkin to you
You lookin at me but I'm lookin through you
I see the blood in your eyes
I see the love in disguise
I see the pain hidden in your pride
I see you're not satisfied
And I don't see nobody else
I see myself, I'm lookin at the

[Chorus: Bruno Mars]
Mirror on the wall, here we are again
Through my rise and fall, you've been my only fan
You told me that they can, understand the man I am
So why are we, here, talkin to each other agai-ai-ai-ain

[Lil Wayne]
Uhh, I see the truth in your lies
I see nobody by your side
But I'm with you when you're all alone
And you correct me when I'm lookin wrong
I see the guilt beneath the shame
I see your soul through your window pain
I see the scars that remain
I see Wayne, I'm lookin at the

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
Lookin at me now, I can see my past
Damn~! I look just like my fuckin dad
Light it up, that's smoke and mirrors
I even look good in the broken mirror
I see my momma smile that's a blessin
I see the change, I see the message
And no message could been any clearer
So I'm startin with the man in the

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne - talking over Chorus]
MJ taught me that
Uhh, take 'em to Mars man
Uhh... {*echoes*}

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne - over Chorus again]
Yeah
Any questions?
I come to you
You always have the answer

[Bruno Mars]
Mirror on the wall

[Lil Wayne]
Ay BP

[Bruno Mars]
So why are we, talkin to each other again
