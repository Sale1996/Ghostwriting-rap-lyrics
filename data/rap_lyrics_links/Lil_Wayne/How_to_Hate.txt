[T-Pain]
Ohhh yeahhhhhhhhh! Oh-hooooo
Oh-hoh, oh-hooooooooo
Nooooo you didn't girl...
She owes me everything and she knows it
I've seen all of the scenes in this movie and she blows it at the end
She keeps talkin to me, cause she knows that I'm a friend
But I can't keep hearin it over and over again
I was the one that you came to
when you broke up wit'cha boyfriend, man fuck him
Girl I was the one, that told you fuck them other niggaz
Then you still went and fucked them other niggaz
Most people learn from the bad things
I hope that you learn, and don't crash and burn in the fast lane
But if you read this letter then you caught me
This should explain all the ways that you taught me

[Chorus: T-Pain]
How to hate a bitch, that owe you everythang
At least a wedding rang, movin on to better thangs
So don't you call me talkin 'bout them other fools
I'm not good enough for you I thought that we was cool
Wooo! Ohh-ahh, oh-oh-ahhhh
Ohh-ahh, oh-oh-ahhh
If you need a shoulder to cry on girl I won't listen
I'm through fuckin with these bitch-ass bitches

[Lil Wayne]
And I don't love them hoes
But don't fuck up with Wayne cause when it "Waynes" it pours
No really, I'm on my "fuck that bitch" shit
You used to be the shit but now you ain't shit bitch
I had a redbone, but she be trippin though
All that bullshit is for the birds, she was pigeontoed
She used to always say, fuck my niggaz
And when I went to jail, she fucked my niggaz
Well~! I guess I'm single for tonight
And you can sit right on my middle finger for the night
And if I sound mad, then you caught me
But this should explain, that you're the one that taught me

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
... Coconut Ciroc
Forgive and forget, bitch I already forgot
I'm over the bitch, and she over the top
They say love is the key, somebody changed the lock
Well~! And I wish I never met ya
And I heard you doin you, and you heard I'm doin better
And all I had to do was put two and two together
But that just makes four, but not for-ever, damn
So much for being the perfect couple
I put in overtime, I was workin doubles
I wish you the best - good luck boo
Weezy F, for Fuck You

[T-Pain]
No ain't nothin goin on
Girl I'm movin on, just take yo' ass home
Get away from here, girl I'm so glad you're gone
This is the last song I'm writin for you
Now I see how you can be
I don't want you 'round me
All you do is down me girl
How many years I tried to get ya
Don't even text my phone when it hit ya
Cause girl you're no good to me

[Chorus]

[Outro: T-Pain]
Whoaaaaa, ohhh, ohhhh
