[Chorus: unknown singer]
And now I knowwww, the only compass that I neeeed
Is the onnnnnne, that leads back to youuuuuu
And I knowwww, the only compass that I neeeed
Oh is the onnnnnne, that leads back to youuuuuu

[Lil Wayne]
She had cat eyes, nine lives, no tan lines, thigh highs
She ride me like a driveby, I'm real these niggaz sci-fi
But that's neither here nor there, she been contemplatin short hair
She said she tryin to be different but she just like the rest of these bitches
But that's neither here nor there, and my dick is her chair
It be sexual warfare, I be loaded like software
Got so many hoes I'm hoein, but she the only one worth knowin
And yeah I do my dirt, but that's for the flowers to grow in
I ain't trippin, but she be trippin
They ain't got shit on me, but she keep sniffin
Look girl just gimme that brain, and I'll return the favor
Them hoes say I'm a dog, but how come I don't chase 'em?
I liquor with no chaser, I pick her out a line-up
I just wanted some time, she say "Okay I'm your honor"
But she been wantin to break up, since Dolce & Gabbana
All that ass I just be like "Come sit yo' groceries on my counter"
I drink tea, she drink wine, call it tea-a-wanna/Tijuana
I dyin to meet a girl, but she want me to meet her momma
Swear I may go Issey Miyake, Bond #9
The weed is funky, but I'm smellin fine - Tunechi~!

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne - over Chorus to start]
I'm puttin my hat back on
She said!!
Yeah...
Uhhh!

I've got that shit in my system
Somebody gon' be my victim
Eh! So where you at with it?
Cause I can't do it by myself, I need an ass-istant
I got that good good, that get right, that early mornin, that midnight
I beat it up, like a fist fight, one, two, three, fo', five, six nights
That dick all in yo' windpipe, some of her friends I dislike
Some of yo' friends, they alright, sometimes I think y'all all dykes
But fuck all that, I'm on one, don't wanna be with the wrong one
That cold head, that warm tongue, my third leg run marathons
I feel you like I'm blind girl; can't you see, it's meant to be
So come to me, then cum for me, my game cold, one degree
I'm rollin with two bad bitches cause misery loves company
One sweet, one sour; my honeybee and my bumblebee
I miss you in the worst way, ride that dick no speed bumps
No red lights, no stop signs, just get to Lil Tunechi

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne - over Chorus to start]
I put my glasses back on, eh!
She said!!
Now I know... get to me baby
You need to get to me baby, I'm waitin

Uhh, uhh, should I call somebody else?
Cause girl it's almost twelve and this dick won't suck itself
Girl you know it need some help, it'll make a nigga's day
If you said you on your way - yeah
Yeah - should I call somebody else?
Cause girl it's almost twelve and this dick won't suck itself
Girl you know it need some help, it'll make a nigga's day
I just hope you know the way - and she said

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne over Chorus]
Yeah, I'm puttin you back on
That's right - and she said!
You need, to get to me
But you already got to me
