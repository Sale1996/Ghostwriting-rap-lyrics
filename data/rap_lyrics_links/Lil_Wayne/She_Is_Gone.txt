{Jae Millz}
My old bitch gone, my new bitch wit me
And she in the club lookin for a new bitch wit me
And truthly tonight I might have ya bitch wit me
She ain't gone dive in that benz but she gone dip wit me
ol girl must thought millz was the next man
who knows where she at she prolly wit her ex man
no second guessin wats the next plan
new season back to the green like a jets fan
I'm bout money and that attracts divas
you put a ring on her must a thought she was a keeper
but now that girl gone like a fast balla cheetah

{Gudda}
East side gudda, add a nudda gudda
my bitch was actin up so I had to get anotha
pockets on full chips stack like pringles
cancel that bitch buy anotha like nino
I lost one got ten moe callin
man women like flees can't shake them bitches off me
I have a new one ever mornin wit my coffee
I'm on that sip and she love it when I'm off speed
so you not wanted like an offing
you nothing to me jus anotha dog bitch barking
no need to come back bitch you can keep walkinG
