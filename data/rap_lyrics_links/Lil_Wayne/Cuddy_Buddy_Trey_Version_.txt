[Intro: Ice Age]
Chorus: You can be my Cuddy cuddy Buddy for sure
You can ride with me, girl don't act you don't already know me
We get in the bed or the floor girl, I wanna take you to H-Town
You can be my Cuddy cuddy Buddy for sure
You can ride with me, girl don't act you don't already know me
We get in the bed or the floor girl; I wanna take you to H-Town
 
[1st Verse: Mike Jones]
Girl if you need this here, call me don't have no fear I wanna love you down
Late nights of lovey dovey
Someone that will love to love me, she's something like a friend
Call her my Cuddy Buddy, even thou she got a man
She already know the plan, she already know the deal so what the business is
Even thou she got a man
She already know the plan, she already know the deal know the deal
Even thou I am chubby chubby, your chick love me love me
She might be with you now, but she still thinking of me
Y'all out there making love, I cut and make them love me
In the back of the Lac, it's just like dame

[Chorus]

[Twista]
I like when you do your lips that, move your hips like that
Move your ass like that, why you make noise like that
Move slow like that, fuck fast like that
Baby I ain't gonna lie to you like that, we both sexually compatible
When I am next to you, I can kill myself when I feel myself inside of you
You can be my Cuddy Buddy, my nutty buddy while do some freaky things with the lights on
Touching on you while we listen to T-Pain, hugging on you while I am listening to Mike Jones
As soon as we get in the sack, I can hit in the back of the lack of the fifth you the yach
Like yeah

[2nd Verse]
It's the middle of the night, y'all got into a fight
Now you there with your feeling hurt, let me buy you a drink
please tell me what you think before I get in those skirts
Skeet skeet I pull up in the Lac truck, beep beep police tell me back up
Beep beep if your man act up he for tie I will be the back up
Cause I am your Cuddy Buddy cccccuddy Buddy
Soon as he fall asleep, she on her way to love me
Cause she know that I pack that wood, and she know that my sex good
We can do it on the bed or on the floor, cause you know that I keep it hood
And she know that I pack that wood, she no that my sex is good
And she knows that I pack that wood, we can do it on the bed or the floor let me know

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
I can be her man
she can be my girl
When we do it's like the end of the world ya dig
We have relations like I am kind to the girl
I am make her holla like when mama brought her into the world
Look I am gonna let him buy you dinner tonight
then at the end of the night your be my dinner tonight
You see he dark, he's always diming his lights
and that girl wanna shine I am gonna bring her into the light
I become her Allah, and I swear that thing feel like lah lah lah lol
Since he feed her lies, I will be her desert on the side

[Chorus]
