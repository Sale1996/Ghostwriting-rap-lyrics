[Rich The Kid]
End of discussion
I went from nothing to something
I want them real deal hunnids
Ooh, she a blondie, look like Kehlani
Pussy tsunami
They talkin', no money, it's nothing
End of discussion
End of discussion
I went from nothing to something
I want them real deal hunnids
Ooh, she a blondie, look like Kehlani
Pussy tsunami
They talkin', no money, it's nothing
End of discussion

Big bag, truckload (huh)
I'm in her throat (throat)
Plug call, I finesse for the dope (plug)
Gucci, my coat (gucci)
Rich nigga, had to come up from broke (rich)
100 a show (100)
Want a feature, it'll be 50 or more (50)
Pull off with yo thottie, I just got that 'rari (skrrt)
Pack touchdown like I'm James Harden (pack)
From nothing to something
Dolce Gabana, my bitch now she stunting
Was trappin' a onion
Rich Forever, boy you know how we bomin'
Matte black Wraith
Pocket, all faces
Can't sit on the bench 'cause I ball baby
Shut down every store in the mall baby
Swerving, she nervous
Young nigga, I was trappin' a birdie
Cook it up, hurry
All of my niggas on 730

End of discussion
I went from nothing to something
I want them real deal hunnids
Ooh, she a blondie, look like Kehlani
Pussy tsunami
They talkin', no money, it's nothing
End of discussion

[Lil Wayne]
I went from nothing to everything
I went from finer to better things
Colombiana and Mary Jane, stuffed the Eddie Bauer with Eddie Cane
Straight to the top, fuck the middle man
I cut him out, Edward Scissorhands
Everytime I pop thousand milligrams, spin to the top like the ceiling fans
Bad bitch pretty, she pretty bad
She might get a bag that come with a bag
Pull out a molly bag, let her dib and dab
Let the money talk 'til it jibber jab
My plug just hit me with a give and go
Now I'm over the stove and I'm whipping ass
Tell the boogeyman I'm the bigger man
Tell the trigger man, "pull the trigger, man"
Pull up on yo ass, two seater
Pull off fast like a loose cheetah
One diamond ring on two fingers
Cheating on these hoes, call me Tune Cheadle
Look how they grinnin' and blushin'
I got the enemy rushing, get it, the enemy Russian
Fuck it, end of discussion
Tune
Money team

Blue cheese, hundos
She gotta go
Want a bag, left the bitch at the door
Pinky on froze
Made a milli, you was chasin' them hoes
The money don't fold, baby mama keep calling my phone
She ride it like a Harley, bitches call me gnarly
Them diamonds fufu, you ain't tricking nobody
I came up from nothing
They was hating, I was getting to the money
My wrist lookin' sunny
Pussy good and she look like Kehlani
Stars in the Wraith, automatic face
She wanna fuck my chain
Pussy poppin', but you bought her a ring
Just to come pull up on me
You probably flex for a week
In Paris, a 50 at least (50)
Too many racks up on me (rich)
