Hey
Nino
Hey

[Verse 1: Juvenile]
Juvenile, I'm throwback
Like eighty-somethin', I go back
Them brown bags, I sold that
Them street corners, I know that
Appetite, I'm so hungry
Democrat, I go donkey
Weed head, I'm junkie
White boy, I smoke honkeys
Niggas like "What Juve on, he wildin' out, he straight trippin'"
Y'all niggas is straight pussy, and y'all about to be rape victims
Boy, I'm fuckin' with truck loads
Started off on my eight ball
Like airplanes on a runway
A real nigga gon' take off
I'm the reason my street hot
Still stick to my G Code
Tee's, Bo's and my Reebox, and I'm cheesed up, I got Cheetos
I told y'all I quit these, but I'm chillin' dawg, I'm on rehab
My lawyer told me my record clean, if y'all fuck with me, I might relapse
Like Noreaga, got a lot of guns, like Las Vegas, I'm pimpin'
Laws keeping they distance, ain't no penetratin' my system
Bad Boy, not Puffy
Hot Boy get stuffy
My main bitch got a black card, she'll spend it all cause she love me

Chorus: Lil Wayne
Bitch, I'm
Picture perfect
I paint a perfect picture
I'm spoonin' with yo bitch, and make you do the dirty dishes
Man, I hate them thirsty bitches, cut 'em off like circumsicion
I'm the type to talk shit
And it be words of wisdom

Repeat Chorus

[Verse 2: Birdman]
Monster, killer, real nigga hustler
On a realer, my nigga, a dope dealer, dealer
Hustler, shinin', a Big Tymer, nigga
So high, on my grind, I be high flyin', nigga
With my strapped up, my guns tight, these niggas know, I get money
Come from Uptown nigga where a killin' take just a few hundreds
Blast, hash, smokin' on that pound
Shinin' with my round, when my nigga touch down
Hundred keys, on his feet, shinin' on them 23's
Blowin' O's, fuckin' hoes, watch me throw another G
Strapped in this field, nigga
Me and my little young nigga
Ridin' around your town, nigga
Gettin' nothin' but money, nigga (One hundred)

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Lil Wayne]
(Verse 3)
Trying to fuck the world, I can't fit
Pockets fat as St. Nick
All I got is my niggas
Cause a bitch still ain't shit
And I got kush all in my swisha
These niggas is tissue
I don't believe in these niggas
Cause I don't believe in superstition
Juve, I got you, dread like Rasta, hair like pasta, I go meatballs
I get up in that ass and hit it fast as Chinese ping pong
And my bitch, she got that fire
My homey got that iron
But I tell 'em "Put it away and you could Punch like a Hawaiian"
Bitch it's Tunechi F. Baby, I'm a, original Hot Boy
My dick felt like a prisoner cause this bitch got lock jaw
I'm so feelin' myself
Truck everybody else
My red bone is ice cold, I'm a fuck the bitch til she melt

Repeat Chorus

(Verse 4)
Bitch, I'm N-O til I G-O
I can't change if I try
I looked to my left, I looked to my right
And time ain't on my side
So that's why I light my blunt
Fat and out of shape
Money on my mind
Pussy on my face (Tunechi...)

Repeat Chorus Twice

[Lil Wayne]
Ya
I told ya
Young Moola, BABY!
