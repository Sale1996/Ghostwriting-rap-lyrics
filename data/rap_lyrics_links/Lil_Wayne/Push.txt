[Lil Wayne - Rap Verse 1ne]
Tribal, yeah right, hehe

Hey mamma, they call me Weezy
And you should be wit me, I got a pocket full of Visas
Baby, I could bless you and you ain't even sneezy
I'll be at your rescue and you don't even need me
I could have you dreamin when you ain't even sleepin
Mamma, I could help you get off, like the weekend
She said she wanna do it to the new Enrique
I pop the disc in and put the song on replay..
And then she backed it up like replay
Hehehe

[Enrique Iglesias - Verse 1ne] (Lil Wayne)
When you're near me..
Girl, I try to hide it, but I can't escape it
Oh baby...
Please forgive me..
When I think of you, my thoughts are so X-rated (Gotta forgive me, baby)
Oh baby..
Baby, I don't give a damn
I know that your man's nowhere in sight, whoa-whoa..
And your eyes don't tell a lie
I know you wanna come with me, tonight
And I say alright, but first you gotta..

[Chorus]
Push, push, back up on me (GiiiiRRRRL..)
Make me believe you want it
Push, push, back up on me (GiiiRRRRL..)
Girl, I can't go home lonely
Push, push, back up on me (GiiiRRRRL..)
Go ahead, lay it on me
Don't stop until the morning (GiiiRRRL..)
Just keep pushing back on me

[Interlude] (girl)
Do you want me? - (You know it)
Do you need me? - (You know it!)
Will you please me? - (You know it)
Will you tease me? - (You know it!)

[Verse 2wo] (Lil Wayne)
Baby, I..(Let's go)
I'm the kinda guy that don't get real excited (Yea!)
Oh baby...
When you have...(Yeah)
When you have your private party, I hope that I'm invited
(Yep) Oh baby..
Baby, I don't give a damn
I know that your man's nowhere in sight
   (Whatcha man gotta do wit me? Tell me!)
And your eyes don't tell a lie
I know you wanna come with me, tonight
And I say alright (well, let's go!), but first you gotta..

[Chorus w/ Lil Wayne ad-libs]

[Lil Wayne - Rap Verse 2wo]
Okay, so after you back it up, just stop
Now drop it like it's hot, and pop it like a glock
And sto it like a watch, now move it like clockwork
Ya body is screamin and ya booty is an outburst
She wanna do it, do it with no delay
I told her I could run it, run it just like relay
Yeah, 'cause I'm cool, just like the breeze way
And +Push It+ like Salt-N-P-E-P-P-A

[Chorus 2X w/ Lil Wayne ad-libs again]

[Lil Wayne - Outro]
Mr. Morales...
