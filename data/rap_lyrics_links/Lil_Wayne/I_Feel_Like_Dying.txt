[Chorus]
Only once the drugs are done
Then I feel like dying, I feel like dying
Only once the drugs are done
Then I feel like dying, I feel like dying
Only once the drugs are done
Then I feel like dying, I feel like dying
I feel like, I-I, I feel like

[Lil Wayne]
I am sittin on the clouds-I got smoke comin from my seat
I can play basketball with the moon, I got the whole world at my feet
playin touch football, on marijuana street
or in a marijuana field-you are so beneath my cleats
Get high, so high that I feel like lying
down in a cigar-roll me up and smoke me'cause (I feel like dying)Haha

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
Swimmin laps around a bottle of Louie The Thirteenth
Jumpin off of a mountain, into a sea of Codeine
I'm at the top of the top-but still I climb
and if I should ever fall, the ground will then turn to wine
Pop, Pop I feel like flying-then I feel like frying
then (I feel like dying)

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
I can mingle with the stars, and throw a party on Mars
I am a prisoner locked up behind Xanex Bars
I have just boarded a plane without a pilot
and violets are blue-roses are red
daisies are yellow, the flowers are dead
wish I could give you this feeling-I feel like buying
and if my dealer don't have no more, then (I feel like dying)

[Chorus] - repeat 'til end
