[Introduction]
Heavenly Father
Creator of all things
I fumbled and said
Was about to become
Heavenly Father

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Before I sleep
I pray to the lord
For a soul to keep
And If I should die
Before I wake
I pray to the lord
For a soul to take
For goodness sake
Before I sleep
I pray to the lord
For a soul to keep
And if I should die
Before I wake
I pray to the lord
My soul to take

[Verse 1: Fat Joe]
Lord forgive me for the killings in the past
All the corrupt business' and dealings that I had
All these pregnant ladies that I served up on the ave.
Have me feel like I'm Bishop when I held my first GAT
They killed Tom right in front of his home
They even murrked Skee in my MPV
So I dropped to my knees, Why it couldn't be me?
Why you had to leave me here with all this ENVY?
Even though I got Freedom I feel like I ain't Free
Everybody dying tryin' to be something they can't be
A couple hundred million is something we'll never see
So we speedin' crashin' head first into a tree

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Fat Joe]
I paid nigga's rents even paid nigga's bails
Gave niggas jobs so they wouldn't go to jail
Did so much dirt niggas knew I wouldn't tell
Paid for some funeral they probably went to hell
I don't owe nobody nothing Man, I gave that bitch a mill
I ain't beating around the bush I'm just speakin' on what's real
I ain't talkin on no bullshit Man, I'm talkin bout what's real
I ain't justifying beatings well she cheated on my Nills
Cheated with his brother God damn this bitch I'll
Probably the reason my niggah left the will
Things you'd never know have mercy on his soul
BIG PUN One of the most realests I ever known

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Fat Joe]
When I die know they bury me a G
Don't cry for me Just let a Nigga Be
In other words let your nigga rest in peace
I been going so hard and I barely got sleep
Lord, I know my mamma gunna take my passing hard
But let her know in these streets her little boy was God
Last of the Mohicans I was takin mothafuckas hearts
Many wars you can see it in the bullet scars
Lord, can you forgive me for my sins?
Let me fly with you Help a nigga spread his wings
Azarya you forever be my Queen
Just know for now Daddy had to go and meet the King

[Chorus]

[Outro]
