[Lil Wayne]
Thank you
I've been through it all
The fields, the falls, I'm like Niagra
But I got right back up like Viagra
I am agriculture, swagger's so mean it might insult ya
Hah, I'm like an ultra vulture
I fuck around and catapult ya
Torture! Thought ya, parents taught ya
You guys is cho-cha, I'm gone, buenas noches
Flow - scorcher, and I don't even write
No - author, so - harder, so - smarter
All about a dollar like fo' - quarters
Oh father, will tonight be my last?
And if so, make sure my kids see my cash
And I know, I'm silent like an album cast
And my future will be better than my past
Weezy!

[Hook]
You can love me or hate me
I swear it won't make me or break me
I'm going wherever the money take me
Until they funeral and wake me, and don't wake me
Cause I'm sleeping, I'm dreaming
I know that there's a better way cause I've seen it lord
But this faster money is so convenient
And I need it, say I need it

[Lil Wayne]
C-A-R-T-E-R
I spit movies like a VCR
I spit rounds like the Tiki bar
And if I got beef I'm the meat cleav-ah
And I are, the illest nigga Martin Luther King died for
And I ride for, Hollygrove 1-7, Eagle Street
And I'm higher than an eagle's feet, but I believe in me
Apple is the cross street, I am just an offspring
Born in the ghetto, that's why I can't let go
One call, I'll have my dogs on ya like an echo
Baby I am the real deal, no pickle
Uh, I spit single cell psycho
I go, off like a motherfucking rifle
And I'm from, the underground baby like a pipe hole
And I will stand tall like light poles until the light blows

[Hook]
And you can love me or hate me
Baby I swear it won't make me or break me
And I be going wherever the money take me
Until they funeral and wake me, and don't wake me
Cause I'm sleeping, and I'm dreaming
See I'm just hustling, living what I believe in dog
And it's a problem when a homie's not eating
And I'm greedy, I'm greedy

[Lil Wayne]
Share my blood, feed my family
My flow will have to plead insanity
So sick I need Grey's Anatomy
Acid like a bust open battery
I'm cool like L.A. nights
I'm tight like ballet tights
Eight twelves, I swear the other day I pissed Cristal
These bitches try to kick it like gentiles
I've got to watch my head in the battle
I'm just trying to stay ahead of my shadow
And I'm floating like a boat and a paddle
Alligators and rattlesnakes
But I promise I will take a nigga off like a Saturday
Got money to validate, I'm icy like carrot cake
Different coloured diamonds make me look like a salad plate
I'm straight out the alley, wait, it's the nigga ya daddy hate
Weezy F. Baby, great!

[Hook]
I know they love me then hate me
But I'm a G, it won't make me or break me
And you can find me wherever the money place me
Yeah, until your riding to the wake B, and don't wake me
Cause I'm sleeping, and I'm dreaming
And here my lord gotta come greet me dog
So I thank him everyday for my achievements
And I'm Weezy, I'm Weezy
