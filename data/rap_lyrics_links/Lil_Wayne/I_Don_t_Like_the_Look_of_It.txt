{I DON'T LIKE THE LOOK OF IT
 I-I-I-I-I DON'T-I DON'T
 I DON'T LIKE THE LOOK OF IT
 I-I-I-I-I DON'T-I DON'T}

[Gudda Gudda]
Go!
Okay, I'm sippin on the syrup, got a nigga movin slow
I'm all about the money, what the fuck you think I do it fo'?
Bitch don't act like you don't know, I'm killin all these rap niggaz
Custom made caskets for yo' motherfuckin funeral (ha ha!)
Keep the women with me, shit I gotta keep like two or mo'
Party everyday, like we won the fuckin Super Bowl
Chillin wit my nigga Mack, he keep bitches handy
White girl on the table, let 'em sniff the nose candy
When I'm walkin by, the women sayin, "Who is that nigga?"
I replied, "Hi, I am Gudda Gudda, that nigga!"
I was raised in the home of the cap splitters
Whip on 24s', watch it crawl like a caterpillar
I come with a toy, boy, like a Happy Meal
And you's a motherfuckin duck, Daffy Dill
I'm from the school of hard knocks, where we scrap and kill
Pick the knife or gun or you can get the package deal
I'm hot nigga, burnin everything around me
I was lost for a minute, took a while but I found me (Gudda!)
The streets say I'm king but the game'll never crown me (Gudda!)
Realist nigga doin it just ask the niggaz 'round me (GUDDA~!)
So you cain't size me up or try to clown, uh
Shark in the water, jump in and I'ma drown ya
New Orleans nigga, gun out, I'ma down ya
Put niggaz to sleep like a muh'fuckin downer
I'm a Great White, youse a flounder
Fish and a bitch, I tuna eveything around ya (haha!)
U-Haul Gudda, movin everything around ya
Its Young Money, bitch! At the top is where they found us, nigga! {*echoes*}

[Lil Wayne]
{*lights lighter, smokes*} Uh..
Goons on deck, Marley don't +shoot+ 'em
Silence on the gun, watch a nigga mute 'em
The coach in the booth, call me Jon Gruden
School these niggas, they all my students
All jokes aside, I ain't playin witcha
The weed broke down, like a transmission
Tha chopper spin him 'round, like a ballerina
Bitch I'm still spittin like I ate a jalapeño
I'm from uptown, my bitch from Argentina
My pockets on +Fat+ like Joey Cartagena
Stunt so hard, it's all y'all fault
And when it come to beef, give me A1 Sauce
I ain't worryin bout shit, everything paid out
You could catch me courtside in Dwayne Wade house
wit a high yellow thick bitch wit her legs out
Cash Money president, but we in a red house
Who the fuck want it? Make my fuckin day
I blow your candles out, now nigga cut the cake
I gotta eat, BEEITCH~! Like a runaway
Y'all niggaz ain't eatin, stomach ache
Okay, all these bitches, and niggaz still hatin
I used to be ballin, but now I'm Bill Gatein
Fuckin with my iPhone, bumpin Illmatic
I'm on the road to riches, there's just a lil' traffic
Hair still platted, thuggin is a habit
Keep my guitar, hip-hop Lenny Kravitz
Bunch of bad bitches and I fuck 'em like rabbits
Dope dick Weezy, ya girlfriend an addict, uh!
Haha.. {*plays guitar*}
