[Drake]
I'm a rapper turned singer, and you can tell that he smoke
But I don't need my vocal chords; all I hit is C notes
N.E.R.D. flow, I spaz if I'm prevoked
I'm about to change the fucking game, pass the remote
Money is everything and it's every other thing
I'm part of the quietest, the model that my brother sing
Cash is the right now, women are post game
MoneyOverBitches.com, check the domain
It's coming too soon, album on the way
People ask me if I pray, I say, "Yeah, once in a blue moon"
Oops I mean a red moon; I did it again to em
Let me leave a space in for your blood affiliation
I say, heavy metaphors, flow so over weight
I could wrap around these other youngins like a cobra snake
Cross bite, drizzy-nigga, nobody as cold as drake
Keep your ass inline; don't be trying to roller skate
Fuck all the discrete shit; I get on some deep shit
I am 21, tell me who do I compete with
I'm on my elite shit; you could tell I'm real
Cause I'm getting hood loving, I ain't even talking street shit
Young angel, young lion, I'm done trying
I'm just doing, who's drinking, cause I'm buying
It's on me, everything is on me
And my girl is still down like she's fucking John B.
And when I go dumb, I tend to do dumb shit
I just listen back and I've sounded like a trumpet
This for all the strippers cause I know that they gone bump it
Tell her back it up and dump it, back it, back it up and dump it
Ain't no pistols here, your money will disappear
My accountant will feed his family off my fiscal year
Tax brackets and back and forth faxes
My money come in full circle, get up on my axis
Maybe I'm a kill 'em, only cause I promised
They think I'm being cocky, but I'm only being honest
I'm swallowing the goose, got a model getting loose
And I never party less; I got some bottles and a booth
I just walk up on the scene, I'm about to take this
I'm just having patience, cause I wanted to make sense
White cup, orange pot, Tennessee State shit
Drop a fo' in it and appreciate the greatness, Drizzy

[Lil Wayne]
Yeah
P-p pass the dro
I am such a beast and you can ask them hoes
And they might even say you should leave me alone
And I don't mean scaaaaag, cause his bitch like me
Stunting is a habit, get it from my daddy
Just like shaggy, I tote that bone-bastic
I'm a rude bastard, I don't give a fuck bout you
I ain't talking moths, but you pluck my balls
And yes I'm falling, but up I've fallen
If your bitch in heat, she could fuck my dog
I went from penny pinching to private planes
Never sat on any benches, I got in games
Starter-Carter, Ball-Harder
Ten girls, pent house suite; ya'll order
Whatever ya'll please: wine, crackers, and cheese
They take off their clothes and put on my T's
The supplement I've taken got me feeling mighty
My gun and money don't split, call that shit Siamese
Yeahyes my watch make the fricken time freeze
Your girl bless me, she suck my dick and I sneeze
Cheap ass apartment, just the kitchen I need
And 18 g's is why the chicken crossed the street
Whatcha know bout it, my niggas so bout it
If you kill everybody, they can't go to court about it, Weezy
I ignore the liars baby, I ignite the fire
I am like a Michael Myers; leave your body in the dryer
Got the shotty on the side of me, my bad boys follow me
I'm a bad boy obviously, popping at your ivy leave
I don't have a robbery, if so you'll have a casueulty
Oops I meant a casualty, oops I meant catastrophe
Oops I meant actually, you niggas is just ass to me
And big wet pussy is more like what I'm rathering
Welcome to the gathering, welcome to the barying
Or I hang you on the wall like a art gallery
You got shark salary and I got long money
I got cash money, I got young money, BITCH
