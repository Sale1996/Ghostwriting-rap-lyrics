DJ Khaled!
Cash Money, Young Money, We the Best
 
[Lil Wayne]
Khaled, I got you!
 
[T-Pain]
Welcome to my hooooood, hee-eee
 
[DJ Khaled] (Lil Wayne) {Rick Ross}
Where the hood at? {Huh} 
Where the hood at?
(YMCMB) {ROSAY~!}
 
[Chorus: T-Pain]
Welcome to my hooooood - Everybody know everybody
And if I got it, everybody got it, uh!
Welcome to my hooooood - Look at all them old school Chevys'
24's so you know we roll heavy, uh!
Welcome to my hooo-ooooo-oood - They outside playin hopscotch
and everybody know this is the hot spot
Welcome to my hooooood - Dem boys'll put you down on your knees
WHOOP! WHOOP! That's the +Sound of Da Police+ in my hood!
 
[Rick Ross]
(ROSAY~!) Audemar on my wrist, diamonds look like they glowin
Fifty stacks all singles, I make it look like it's snowin
Black unmarked cars, gotta peep how they playin
Treat 'em like jack boys, catch 'em slippin then slay 'em
Lord forgive me for my siiiiins, thats my confession 
If that put me in this Beeeenz, I got possession 
of a federal offeeeence, I'm talkin pressure 
in my criminal inteeeent (huh), so wear ya vests-es 
And I'm still gon' stunt, like it ain't no tomorrow 
Fuck ya house note, nigga, blow that bitch on a bottle
The Ferrari just a front, got the Lambo in the back
(ROSAY~!) Tell you +we the Best Forever+, DJ Khaled handle that, huh!
 
[Chorus]
 
[Plies]
Takeoff, T-takeoff..
I know some niggaz from my hood that woulda ROBBED Noriega!
I'm talkin Noriega, nigga, the +REAL+ Noriega!
If you ain't from the hood, bitch, then stop impersonatin us
And tell Congress when you see 'em, "Bitch, I'm stealin cable!"
And leave the d-boys alone 'cause they motivate us
And why's the half of my whole hood on papers?
Some o'em on house arrest ('rest), some o'em on child supp'ot (p'ot)
Some o'em did they bid, the other half waitin to go to court
Mr. Landlord we gon' BUST yo' ass with an eviction note
Better have the police witchu, dawg, if you came to repo
Im talkin strip clubs, Im talkin liquor stores
We throw our money 'round here, but yall can call us po'
 
[Chorus]
 
[Lil Wayne]
I'm goin in..
Uh, bitch I'm on probation.. so my nerves bad
And they say time flies, well mine's first class
I landed in the sky, I fell from the streets
I talk a lot of shit, and practice what I preach
BACK from hell, cell 23 
Tell the warden kiss my ass, pockets on Mo'Nique
Bitch, I'm from the murder capital, hoe I'm far from practical
Shit happens and since I'm the shit, I'm who it happen to
Young Money, Cash Money, Blood, bitch, I'm +red+ hot
I don't see nobody, see nobody/no body like a head shot
All that bullshit is for the birds, throw some bread out
Got it sewed up, check the thread count
 
[Chorus 2: T-Pain] (Lil Wayne)
Welcome to my hooooood - Everybody know everybody (Uh!)
And if I got it, everybody got it, uh! (Young Mula, bayyy-bay)
Welcome to my hooooood - Look at all them old school Chevys'
24's so you know we roll heavy, uh! (YMCMB)
Welcome to my hooo-ooooo-oood - They outside playin hopscotch (Khaled, I GOTchu!)
and everybody know this is the hot spot
Welcome to my hooooood - Dem boys'll put you down on your knees
WHOOP! WHOOP! (...I say fuck the) police in my hood! (Ha ha!)
