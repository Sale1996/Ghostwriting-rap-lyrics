[Intro/Chorus]
Six foot, seven foot, eight foot, bunch!
Six-six foot, seven foot, eight foot, bunch!

[Lil Wayne]
Excuse my charisma, vodka with a spritzer
Swagger down pat, call my shit Patricia
Young Money militia, and I am the commissioner
Yadon't want start Weezy cause the F is for Finisher
So misunderstood, but what's a world without enigma?
Two bitches at the same time, synchronized swimmers
Got the girl twisted cause she open when you twist her
Never met the bitch, but I fuck her like I missed her
Life is the bitch, and death is her sister
Sleep is the cousin what a fuckin family picture
You know Father Time, and we all know Mother Nature
It's all in the family but I am of no relation
No matter who's buyin, I'm a celebration
Black and white diamonds, fuck segregation
Fuck that shit, my money up, you niggaz just Honey Nut
Young Money runnin shit and you niggaz just runner-ups
I don't feel I done enough so I'ma keep on doin this shit
Lil Tunechi or Young Tunafish...

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
Yeah.. I'm goin back in, okay
I lost my mind, it's somewhere out there stranded
I think you stand under me, if you don't understand me
Had my heart broken by this woman named Tammy
But hoes gon' be hoes so I couldn't blame Tammy
Just talked to moms, told her she the sweetest
I beat the beat up, call it self defense
Swear man I be seein through these niggaz like sequins
Niggaz think they He-Men, pow, pow, the end
Talkin to myself because I am my own consultant
Married to the money, fuck the world, that's adultery
You full of shit, you close your mouth and let yo' ass talk
Young Money eating, all you haters do is add salt
Stop playin bitch, I got this game on deadbolt
Mind so sharp, I fuck around and cut my head off
Real nigga, all day and tomorrow
But these muh'fuckers talkin crazy like they jaw broke
Glass half empty, half full I'll spill ya
Try me and run into a wall outfielder
You know I'ma ball 'til they turn off the field lights
The fruits of my labor, I enjoy 'em while they still ripe
Bitch stop playin, I do it like a king do
If these niggaz animals, then I'ma have a mink soon
Tell them bitches I say put my name on the wall
I speak the truth, but I guess that's a foreign language to y'all
And I call it like I see it... and my glasses on
But most of y'all don't get the picture 'less the flash is on
Satisfied with nothin, you don't know the half of it
Young Money, Cash Money...
Paper chasin tell that paper look I'm right behind ya
Bitch real G's move in silence like lasagna
People say I'm borderline crazy, sorta kinda
Woman of my dreams, I don't sleep so I can't find her
You niggaz are gelatin, peanuts to an elephant
I got through that sentence like a subject and a predicate
Yeah, with a swag you would kill for
Money too strong, pockets on bodybuilder
Jumped in a wishin well, now wish me well
Tell them kiss my ass~! Call it kiss and tell

[Cory Gunz]
Yeahhhhh
Word to my mama I'm outta my lima bean
Don't wanna see what that drama mean, get some Dramamine
Llama scream, hotter than summer sun on a Ghana queen
Now all I want is hits, bitch, Wayne signed a fiend
I-I played the side for you niggaz that's tryin to front and see
Son of Gunz, Son of Sam, you niggaz the son of me!
Pause for this dumber speech, I glow like Buddha
Disturb me, and you'll be all over the flow like Luda'
Bitch I flow like scuba, bitch I'm bold like Kiva
And I keep a killer hoe, she gon' blow right through ya
I be macking 'bout my stackin and now I pack like a mover
Shout to Ratchet for backin out on behalf of my shooter
Niggaz think they high as I, I come laugh at your ruler
Cash Money cold bitch, but our actions is cooler
Wayne, these niggaz out they mind
I done told these fuck niggaz so many times
That I keep them bucks steady on my mind
Tuck these, I fuck these on your mind, pause
to feed them on my grind, did I get a little love?
Keep throwin my sign in the middle
Hit 'em up, piece on my side
Cause ain't no peace on my side - bitch~!
I'm a man, I visit urinals abroad
Tune tell me to I'm shootin when the funeral outside

[Chorus]

[Cory Gunz - over Chorus]
I'm Uptown, thoroughbred, a BX nigga, ya heard?
Gunna
