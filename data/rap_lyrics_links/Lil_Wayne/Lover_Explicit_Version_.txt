[Intro]
Young Money

[PJ Morton]
This argument is just gonna keep goin on.. and on
And at this point, I don't even really care who's right or wrong
Uh.. I just don't wanna fight anymore
Even forgot what we're arguing for
And if you think this is the way to be
I'm sorry, this ain't gon' work for me

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know, I know that no one's perfect
But what's the purpose
if we can't even make it through the day
Without fighting, we can't even get along
I would just rather let it go
Cause you should already know that

[Chorus]
I'm a lover, I'm a lover, I'm a lover, I'm a lover
Not a fighter, not a fighter, not a fighter
I'm a lover, I'm a lover, I'm a lover, I'm a lover
Not a fighter, not a fighter, not a fighter
I'm a lover, I'm a lover, I'm a lover, I'm a lover
Not a fighter, not a fighter, not a fighter
I'm a lover, I'm a lover, I'm a lover, I'm a lover
Not a fighter, not a fighter, not a fighter

[Lil Wayne]
Uh, she say she love but all we do now is fuck and fight
Man, I just pull them draws over like they runnin lights
Gotta cut my phone off like I'm on the flight
cause if I don't, she gon' check it like a pair of Nikes
Why you wanna go and do dat, do dat?
Trippin like you stepped on a crack, you wack
C'mon now, don't start honey
I put that dick up on ya good and make you walk funny
See I'm a lover, not a fighter, but I beat that pussy up
And I amy not be Mr. Perfect but we make the perfect couple
I think so, and you drink so
Chill 'fore I put ya ass out like a single
Shit gon' get real if you don't quit it, everybody got a limit
We argue over bullshit/+Bull+ shit and you ain't Scottie Pippen
Uh, but I ain't trippin on yo' ass
I wonder what you'd ever do if I went missin on yo' ass
Tunechi!

[Pre-Chorus and Chorus]
