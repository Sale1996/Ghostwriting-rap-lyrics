(mannie fresh in background)

[Verse One]
Say boooyyyyy
You ain't want to get hit with the AR, AR, 15, 15, flip cars
So just imagine what it do to pussy niggaz that goin against me
I come hhhaaard, I'm so hard
I'm bruising up my knuckles I'm watching my fist bleed, fist bleed
So whhhaaat
I'm bustin this bustin, this fuckin up everybody that I see
So move to the left, cause you might catch a hot one
Tear a whole square out ya chest with the shotgun
Make a whole pair out one nigga with the shotgun
We can go there, my nigga, I'm so there
Ridin by myself with the chopper on the backseat
Shoot out the driver side knock his body to the backseat
Stop pause, make the Dominique Dawes
Flippin bitch niggaz when them shorty's go off he

[Chorus]
Lose the handguns, we don't got back nigga
We hold shotguns, we pop that nigga
And when you shot it, don't it
It make ya body bounce
You do the shorty bounce

And when it hit you don't it
It make ya body bounce
You do the shorty bounce, bounce

Shorty Bounce
Now bounce shorty bounce
Now bounce shorty bounce
It make ya body bounce

[Verse Two]
Now, ay fella
You ain't wanna get hit with the AK, AK, 47, 47, heavy metal
Guns and roses
Roses and dresses
Funeral settins
Blessins
Ay man
You see 'em on the waist
I'm tryna shoot straight, straight shot
Don't lose faith
Homie use safe
Hit ya in ya grill, now they call you two face
This ain't dance, this a motherfuckin' pressure point
Eartquake, break a nigga down to a decimal
Break a nigga break, break a nigga down to a vegetable
Lay ya grandmother next to you
This the the untestable, the untouchable
The young stunna do, whatever stunna do
Stop pause nigga, make the Dominique Dawes
Flippin bitch niggaz when them shorty's go off he

[Chorus]

[Verse Three]
Ay chump
You ain't wanna get hit with this straight pump
just a pump, with the pump, with the pump
Not the pump, the pump
You know if I get em, you got already, you got already gotta slump
I shot 'em once, with the buckshots
Make it look like a sun shots
A nice body all dumb hot
He turned cold dead
Anybody in the city cops say did
Look me in my eyes nah look me in my barrel
Leave a barrel strawberry cherry on ya apple
I'm a very scary, new orleans mammal
Shorty on my back got me workin like a camel
Put a hole in ya back and lift you up
I'm weezy f baby
Guess whats up
Stop pause, make the Dominique Dawes
Flippin bitch niggaz when them shorty's go off he

[Chorus]
