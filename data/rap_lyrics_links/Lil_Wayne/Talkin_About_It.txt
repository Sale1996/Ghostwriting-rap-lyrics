Yeah, Yeah, OK

[Hook]
Came in the game as a young-un
Signed with Cash Money, pocket full of money
Niggas popping shit, always talking bout something
See ya ass in public, it's a whole 'nother subject
Man they just talking bout it, they just talking bout it
And I'm on the streets with it, I'm on the streets with it
See where I come from, you gotta be about it
And if you want it want it, we'll come and see about it

[Lil Wayne]
OK, uh
It's Weezy baby like the last shit
A big car and a bad bitch, uhhhh
I'm so fly, I need my ass kicked
These niggas balling by accident, uhhhh
Keep talking nigga, fuck up your body
Send ya homie to tell ya mom it was an accident, uhhhh
I'm a G till the casket
Drop all my glasses, uhhhh
Fast money, I'm the fastest
I got that hustler's passion, you know?
Dem boys back at the ass end
I'm at the bank trynna cash in, OK

[Hook]

[Lil Wayne]
OK
There's been a murder, bitch I make a killing
Insurance papers in the safe, money in the ceiling, huh
I got a pillowcase full of pistols
Come through a nigga house and aim at the pillows, huh
Yeah, wake up, wake up
Fucking with the boys, you could wake up taped up
Ya dig? Now go and drink that lake up
Stick him in the trunk and let him feel that bass pump
Hah, these niggas is nuts
Man that M-14 leave you physically fucked
Hah, these niggas is ducks
Well you could call me Scrooge cause I'm swimming in bucks
Bitch!

[Hook]

[Lil Wayne]
OK, yeah, yeah
Too hot, too cold
I'm, I'm red hot, blue cold, yeah
I knock ya melon out ya fruit bowl
All my guns black, I got truth sold, yeah
And I call my coup a black panther
"Blat, blat, blat" That's the gat anthem
And if a nigga play with family for that matter
I'ma smoke so many niggas I'ma catch cancer, yeah
And if I step up out this Benzo
You know I'm coming with a gun like a Nintendo
They soft, them niggas falling when the wind blow
Then I'm rolling up my window, fuck 'em!

[Hook]
