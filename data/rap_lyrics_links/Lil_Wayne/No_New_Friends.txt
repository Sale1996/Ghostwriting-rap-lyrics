[Intro: Drake] + (DJ Khaled)
(Another one - another one) Yeah..
I stay down with my day one niggas and we in the club screaming
(DJ KHALED~!)

[Chorus: Drake]
No new friends, no new friends, no new friends, no, no new
Still here with my day one niggas, so you hear me say
No new friends, no new friends, no new friends, no, no new
I still ride with my day one niggas, I don't really need
No new friends, no new friends, no new friends, no, no new
I stay down from day one so I say
Fuck all y'all niggas except my niggas
Fuck all y'all niggas except my niggas - one more time
Fuck all ya'll niggas except my niggas
Fuck all ya'll niggas - stay down from day one so I say

[Drake]
Uhh, man this shit so ill that we had to restart it
H-Town my second home like I'm James Harden, money counter go burrr when you sellin' out the Garden
Four car garage, pornstar m√©nage, Birdman go brrr cause he know this shit retarded
Fuck her on the floor before we make it to the bed
that's what your ass really call +Started from the Bottom+, yes lord~!
OVO Sound man I'm proud of my niggas, knew that we would make it never doubted my niggas
All my bitches love me; if I had a baby mama she would probably be richer then a lot of you niggas
Aye~! That's luxury dawg, day one niggas man ya'll stuck with me dawg
Ever since Youtube niggas been calling me the leader of the new school; fuck with me dawg, yeah

[Chorus]

[Rick Ross]
{M-M-M-Maybach Music} You know what it is, homie side baby
Your bitch all in my photographs (WHOO), ho niggas got hate for me (HUH)

Big homies all certified, nothing niggas gon' take from me
Follow codes, study game, feed fam nigga fuck fame
All black my whip foreign, these bad hoes keep tiptoeing
Down in Turks and Caicos, dope boy that's my dress code
All I hug is blood nigga, Khaled that's my flesh tho
All I want is love nigga, money bring that stress tho
Smoke good I love life, strip club like er'y night
Every night my same niggas, day one, straight menace 
Rozay! WHOOOO.. HUH! {M-M-Maybach Music}

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
Ugh, I'm here with my niggas, I'm too high to be friendly
They throw dirt on my name, well that's why they still dig me
And I'm tired of all this hating, I thank God for my patience
I thank God for my homies, I wish we could trade places
Bitch we good-fellas; boy, all them, niggas, with you 
they just pall bearers and if we ball catch us
Remember sip slow, live fast, Young Money, stay young
I been Cash Money since day one - Tunechi

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne - over Chorus]

Su-woo! Sip slow, live fast, Young Money, stay young
I've been Cash Money... uhh
