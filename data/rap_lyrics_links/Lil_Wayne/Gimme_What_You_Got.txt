[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder
Well, I bet I couldn't look more bolder
Hold her, as we dip into my solar
Call me for baby, I explore her
This navigator, you dont want like Lincoln
Black Bentley, you look better in a pink one
She smokin' and I'm about to steam one
Let's skip and make love on Venus
Baby the ball's in your court like Serenus
Make me jump over that net, between us
And let nothin' get between us
We too hot, only sweat between us

(Chorus)
Girl your hot like fire, gimme what you got
Coldest thing movin', gimme what you got
Heat up like summer, gimme what you got
Girl you know what your doin', gimme what you got
You got twenty-eights on the hummer, gimme what you got
'Cause you the number one stunna, gimme what you got
You got it, gimme what you got, you got it, GIRL

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
That's it baby girl, put it on my zipper
We ain't in the club but I still wanna tip her
You should be my misses, I can be your mister
Put me on deck shorty, I can be your skipper
I'll give you a kiss for everytime you make me smile
I'll give you a thousand, if you stay a little while
Know that and it's gettin' stronger
The feelin' that I got for you shorty, do what it do
 
(Chorus)

[Verse 3: Chris Brown]
Exit now I got a place where we can go
Back seat action, sunroof for two's
And the windows tinted, so nobody could look in
Put it in gear and burn out with me
I'll give you a kiss for everytime you make me smile
I'll give you a thousand if you stay a little while
Know that and it's gettin' stronger
The feelin' that I got for you shorty do what it do

(Chorus)

[Verse 4: Chris Brown]
(Ow) giiiiirrrrllll, you the finest thing that i've seen
And I'm tryin' to get with you
Giiiiirrrrllll, girl your on fire and I know that your burnin hot
(Shorty your burnin hot) and I'm talkin' to you
I'm a set you on fire and all I do is think about you, yeah
 
(Chorus 2X)
