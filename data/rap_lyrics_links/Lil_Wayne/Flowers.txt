Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Lil Wayne]
We got flowers for the ladies and dick for them hoes
Petunia's and Daisy's black on red rose
Two time Phantom black and red rose
That dick make them rest in peace I got a bunch of dead hoes
I got east-side with me nigga we ain't trippin'
And if a nigga fuck with us then they gone find you when they fishing
Man them hoes ain't on a mission but girl I ain't the uno
Skinny ass jean, pockets on sumo
Yeah bitch I know you see me
I'm so YM just know I am
I ain't perfect lord knows I sin
Two cup boys what you know bout them?
What it do girl, I'm serious,
Tunechi that's my alias
And I go down under like australia.

[Chorus (Lil Wayne & Twist)]
We got flowers for the ladies and dick for them hoes some say the EX make the sex so I roll up my sleeve and roll up my weed I'm getting money fast and all my hoes up to speed and I'm like shawty what yo name is...
And who you came with, you got that fire I'm just tryna keep your flame lit she say she on one, I'm on that same shit let take our clothes off and do whatever makes sense

[Lil Twist]
I be in my zone,
Girl I'm in my zone,
Man I go so tough I go sylvester stallone
I got money in my pocket
I'ma trending topic
Your on the outside looking in window shopping
Wait, hold up, stop the press
Shawty dropped her dress
You know it ain't trickin if you got it I'll invest
Man, everybody ballin so any nobody trippin
I hit her with that twist and now I got her twistin'

[Chorus]
Flowers for the ladies and dick for them hoes some say the EX make the sex so I roll up my sleeve and roll up my weed I'm getting money fast and all my hoes up to speed and I'm like shawty what yo name is...
And who you came with, you got that fire I'm just tryna keep your flame lit she say she on one, I'm on that same shit let take our clothes off and do whatever makes sense

[Chris Brown]
Damn I think all these girls in the club look sexy
Black girls, Becky's
Hopefully I take her mom back to the crib and have a couple of sips and get naked
Skinny nigga but I'm flexin
I rock all these rings like wrestling
I pin her down, go a couple of rounds and I break the springs when we sexing
(GOING) damn
I just want my cash
Girl yo booty donkey so I might act an ass
In the party I'ma buy the whole bar out
So don't give me no glass
Girl I'ma eat-eat your heart out and I might even lick your ass
Twist what you doing with that bottle you ain't old enough to drink that yet
Weezy told me to monitor this party
Gone have fun let them girls in this bitch
(YIKES) 18 and over
Twap Twap game over
Party hard rock and rolla
In the jungle views of roses

[Chorus]
Flowers for the ladies and dick for them hoes some say the EX make the sex so I roll up my sleeve I roll up my weed I'm getting money fast and all my hoes up to speed and I'm like shawty what yo name is...
And who you came with, you got that fire I'm just tryna keep your flame lit she say she on one, I'm on that same shit let take our clothes off and do whatever makes sense
