Typed by: AZ Lyrics

[Chorus]
Say what the fuck going on, man, it must be twerk season
Something in the air, it must be twerk season
'Cause they dancin', dancin' for no reason
Man, they dancin', dancin', dancing for no reason
Bitch, twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk
Bitch, twerk, twerk, twerk, bitch, twerk, twerk, twerk, bitch, twerk

[Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Big up to my amigo, he gave me a kilo for my ego
Talkin' 'bout you "popped the molly"
You just took you a placebo
And my suit is Valentino, she is hot as jalapeÃ±o
I can do a drive-by listening to Bobby Valentino
I can make her ass wiggle, I can get some cash with her
Talkin' 'bout your ex-boyfriend, fuck you and your last nigga
You ain't talkin' 'bout shit if you ain't talkin' 'bout us
Saying something in the air, yeah, bitch it's some ones
Twerk, twerk, twerk
Have you ever got some head while driving in reverse?
I ain't into backing up, but just in case I'm backing out
Now look how she reactin', now I put it in, she asking ow

[Chorus]
Say what the fuck going on, man, it must be twerk season
Something in the air, it must be twerk season
'Cause they dancin', dancin' for no reason
Man, they dancin', dancin', dancing for no reason
Bitch, twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk
Bitch, twerk, twerk, twerk, bitch, twerk, twerk, twerk, bitch, twerk

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Big up to my lil' sweet ho
My lil petite ho
Keep it a C-note
When my main ho act like a P.O.
Ain't that frÃ­o? That's Sub-Zero
I say one time for that bitch who just want dick and somethin' to eat
Only want a number three, that's my pussy custody
I want a slim fine woman with some twerk with her
She ain't got no nosy friends, just a purse with her
She ain't got a lot of ass but I can work with her
Nigga, that's my cup of tea, ha, burnt my tongue
Oh, she got a popcorn booty
Every time I see that ass it make me wanna watch a movie
It's supposed to be a lot of hard working going on
But who the fuck can focus with all this twerking going on?

[Chorus]
Say what the fuck going on, man, it must be twerk season
Something in the air, it must be twerk season
'Cause they dancin', dancin' for no reason
Man, they dancin', dancin', dancing for no reason
Bitch, twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk, twerk
Bitch, twerk, twerk, twerk, bitch, twerk, twerk, twerk, bitch, twerk
