[Wayne] Yeah

{"Gangsta Grillz, you bastards!"}

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I love all my bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
A $2 bill is still a couple dollars
And if any one of them niggas got a fuckin' problem
I'ma milk all of 'em cause they fuckin' cowards
I love red bitches, there's just somethin' 'bout 'em
But I'm gettin' better pussy from a brown one
Been schoolin' y'all niggas, I'm your alma mater
I'm the shit, where the fly swatter?

[Lil Wayne]
Ooh, I know you dykin' who you eatin' on
Make me think about all them nights we got a threesome on
Make me think about how you suck it like your teeth are gone
If your friends hatin' on you, fuck 'em to each his own, yessir
I do my drugs then I sleep 'em off
Like it just be callin' me, I need to turn my ringer off
Ain't a fuckin' singalong unless you brought the weed along
That kush - okay I got it, that kush
Cop pounds and put my people on
We can take the stairs up to the stars, that's where we belong
Fuck that shit you talk, I beat that pussy like production
Or like Rocky, beat the Russian; or like Jordan, beat the buzzer
Nigga, gimme what you've got, take that money like an usher
One man band, all you hear is repercussion
Told a bitch "Too much selfish gonna lead to self destruction"
She looked me in my eyes and said "Man, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'"
I said "Shorty, you a beast"

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I love bad bitches, okay what's the problem?
If she thinks she gonna come up then I'ma fuckin' drown her
I'm wilder than public schools and public housin'
Can't afford failure, I'm just browsin'
Uhh, I was 15 with $100,000
And if you talk trash, I'ma fuckin' possum
And nigga, if your bitch got a eye problem
You know what it is, armed robbery - Tunechi

[Euro]
Uhh, I heard 'em tell me "Go get 'em, young"
I haven't seen a movie since I started livin' one
I be in a room full of bitches, gettin' drunk
Smokin' like a point guard, no look, passin' blunts
Fuck you talkin' 'bout? Euro, this and that
Wanna walk in these shoes? Have the outfit to match
And niggas schemin' on what I had
But we gon' put money in the bag or a body in the bag
You choose, and all these new bitches old news
Throwin' stacks at 'em like "That's prol'ly gon' bruise"
And every dream girl that I fucked came true
Now every night feels like deja vu
And the hatin's no use, she ain't waitin' on you
I tell a baby "Tell ya man kick rocks with no shoes"
And I murder that pussy and I ain't leave a clue
Cause I put her on her knees and made her swallow all the proof
Uhh, that sick shit, I'm ill, yeah I'm a fuckin' problem
I'm fine with it though, bitches like fuckin' problems
And I can't solve shit if I'm the fuckin' problem
Just know I got 'em, let me know if there's a fuckin' problem
Out the city but you can't take the city out 'em
I know these hoes well, see the water spittin' out 'em?
Long story short, money always colorblind
She blew the team for some Red Bottoms, Euro

[Kidd Kidd]
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin problem
Had a few ugly bitches but I had to hide 'em
Can't live with em, can't live without em
Can't trust them hoes pokin' holes up in condoms
Put a S on her breast, she a supermodel
If you swallow these kids, do that make you childish?
Now she say I got a fuckin' problem
Because I fucked her once and gave a fuck about her
Her hair blown out like the 80s
I drive these bitches crazy, mental asylum should pay me
I ain't lookin' for a lady, call Will Smith to get you +Hitched+
I ain't lookin' for a wife, I need a one night trick
That can ride it like that, suck it like this
Hit it from the back in the back of the whip
I'm a mac, I'm a pimp girl
You don't need make up, put this mac on your lips
She drive a X5, beefin' with her ex man
Baby I'ma dog and a DMX fan
Told myself I wouldn't mess with my ex again
Popped a lil X then I tried to explain
I keep it too real to ever be a lame
Too many girls in this world, you all be lame
She all on my dick cause I got street fame
Told that thirsty ass bitch don't speak my name
Kidd Kidd, a nut from the nine
Tell 'em don't worry bout me, I'm just fine
Girl if you comin' with me then let's ride
I know you want money so don't waste my time
Uh, wear that ass out fuck until we pass out
Fuck a hotel, we goin' to my mans house
Scratch that your baby mama was an Amtrak
We treat that pussy like some good weed and pass that
Yeah, to my niggas, she fuck my niggas
Bought some bitches and she was with it; with you she wasn't, but she did it
She let you lick it, but never stick it
You be trippin, you say you fallin', nigga you slippin'
Uh, stupid ass nigga tryna' fall in love
If I fall, it's gon be from too many drugs
You askin' questions, bout what she was
With the Rida Gang, she told you in the club
Hahahah
