[Lil Wayne talking]
Yea.yea.yea.yea
This is the Carter muthafucka, yea
And in my building I must keep it real

[Lil Wayne]
And man I miss the times, we would shine, you would keep on your side
You would teach me how to ride and you would teach me how to pry
Then we get on the line and go over our lines
We were in the same position and that's when you change position, shit
I never change and I miss ya, and its strange but I never forget ya
Throw that at you and them bitches homie
And I know that aint you wit that dissin on me
That's why I never replied and never will just let em live phony
If ya ever died I swear to God I got yo kids homie
Whats mine is their I gotta give homie, and yea
We still a army in this bitch homie
Yea Cash Money still the shit homie, shit homie
Whats really real is you feelin me nigga
That Hot Boy shit still in me nigga, word the giggity nigga
And I aint got time to speak the history
I miss you and I know you missin
Gizzle but
 
[Hook: Reel(Lil Wayne)]RepeatX2
Man I miss my dawgs(yea)
Many nights club poppin(yea)
Many nights we were blowin trees(yea)
Many nights we were hustlin(yea)
Man I miss my dawgs(yea)
Me and you through thick and thin(yea)
Me and you through the very end(yea)
For only you I was in the game(yea)

[Lil Wayne]
And I remember when you came to the click
I had already made my name in the click, but you got famous and shit
I got my solja rag and dangled my shit
I was down to just to hang wit you shit
And I banged to the boogie bang bang wit yo click
And I aint even from the 3(3rd Ward), my hood was angry at me, shit
But I rose to my feet, played the post wit the heat
At them shows while you performed and posed
I was waitin for a nigga to jump, see I was patient but was ready to duck
Cuz you my brother chump
Real Gs never buckle up
But every family aint filled wit gangstas that's real
And that's real and I would never turn my back or turn ya down
Even if you turned around muthafucka
But history is history
I miss you and I know you missin me
Juve but

[Lil Wayne]
You was my nigga, my nerd, my joy, my herb
My main muthafuckin man Turk
My other, my partner, I was teacher, he was father
I skilled, he schooled, we chilled, we moved
We thug, we hung, we ate, we slept
We lived, we died, I stayed, you left
Remember how we played to the left
And we stayed out of trouble cuz we stayed to our self
Member B and Slim leavin, hand the ki's over
Tell me not to go Uptown and we went straight to tha Nolia
While I watched you reunite wit yo soljas
And yo mom and brothers, while I lied to the stunna
Yea those were the times my brother
Now I recognize real and I honor my brother
Yea nigga sub mage my brother, the Sqad's my brother
The nigga you left behind is my brothers
