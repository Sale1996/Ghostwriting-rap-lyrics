This is the archetypal rock sound

[Lil Wayne]
Ok this really ain't no rock shit
But um, let go
Hollygrove monster
New Orleans maniac
Shoot a nigga up until his whole body ain't attached

Hi, my name is best rapper alive
And your mouth is the best crapper alive
Cause you talk shit, I get hit and walk it off
Like fuck that, then I just spit like barking dogs
Call it bust back
Attitude like fuck em all
And I'm greasy
And your boyfriend is a butterball
What's geezy
I mean what's good, bitch is you blind
Check my watch bet it be money all the time
Sunny on the side where I stay at
Where M.I.A. at
I get pussy every time I say that
In the game room, I don't play that
Bitch nigga get laid down where he lay at
AK at your front door
Young Zo
You can ask Brisco
Shoot til my wrist so
Coupe with a bitch low
Who put the slick pull
I'm tired of the south, so in your mouth is where the dick go
Yeah

They like it when I say yeah huh?
And your boyfriend's a tampon
And I don't own land baby
I own a land mine
So step on my land and catch a bomb like Anquan
Weezy F. and the F is for franchise
You lookin at me is like you're lookin through ant eyes
Young Money can't die
Bitch we like Hancock
Yeah I'm a Martian what you saying Spock
I turn your beef into a ham hot
Then I put it in a pan pot
Shoot 'til my hand hot
I can't hear you saying stop
I hear nina sayin pop
I hear choppers sayin chop
I hear niggas screamin and shit
Like I said holla at ya boy bitch
But holla at ya boy bitch
I'm the boy bitch
Not ya boy bitch
Cause ya boy a bitch

Yeah
Young Moola Crazy

[Gudda Gudda]
Eastside Loco
You're sweet like cocoa
And you can get your ass beat fast like go-go
Mask on my face, low pro that a no show
Shoot a rapper when his album drop give 'em promo
You clown like bozo
They ask him bout the group shit
It's time to get the loot bitch I had to go solo
Your bitch all on me, you better watch your hoe though
She wanna come kick it like a dojo, uh-oh
Slick nigga fuck 'em then I drop 'em like a low low
Bitch want money like mils no, no-no
Nigga if you hating suck a dick no homo
Boy I keep it gutter like bo-bos
Yeah I'm doin what I do so nigga just do you
And my gun nicknamed m√©nage, she do two
Nigga welcome to the Young Money age zoo crew
We starvin and you could get ate like zoo-zoos

Niggas boo-hoo cry motherfucker I'm heartless
I'll break bones and cartilage
You are just a mark muthafucker
I'm a marksman
And I'm all about the green like Boston
Pardon me nigga I'm talkin reckless
You walk into a gun fight
Knife, no vest, bitch you crazy
Just like the ice you wearin you fugaze
Put 'em in the dirt
Make 'em push a few daisies
80's baby
Soon to be rich nigga
King Kong beatin on my chest on you bitch niggas
Paper I'm after
So I'm on your ass now
Young Money mothafucking cash cow
