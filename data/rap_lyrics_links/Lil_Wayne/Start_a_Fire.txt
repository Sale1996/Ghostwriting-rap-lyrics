[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Mama I'm in love with a hot girl
And they just don't get it, they just don't get it
Temperature's risin', her body yearnin'
Yeah we on that R. Kelly - and then she tell me

[Chorus: Christina Milian]
Let's start a fire, you'll be my lighter
Baby I'll be your gasoline
Let's start a fire, watch the entire
World as it opens up in flames
Let's start a fiiiiire
Let's start a fiiiiire
Let's start a fiiiiire
Let's start a fire, ire, ire

[Lil Wayne - over Chorus]
Uhh, uhh.. and they just don't get it
Uhh, uhh.. and they just don't get it
Yeah, Mickey and Mallory
Yeah, Bonnie and Clyde (hehe) Thelma and Lil Weezy
Am I right?

[Lil Wayne]
I'm like goodness gracious, great wall of China
All we do is fuck all day, all ma√±ana
It's a cold world, I stay warm inside her
Make her perspire, sweat, blood, and cry and
Goodness gracious, great God Almighty
She fuck me like a +King+ -- Stephen, Martin, Rodney
We break all of monotony, baby we high commodity
And they just don't get it

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne - over Chorus]
Yeah, yeah.. and they just don't get it
Uhh, uhh.. and they just don't get it
Me and you... they just don't get it

[Intro]

[Christina] Let's start a fire

[Lil Wayne]
Like goodness gracious, great balls of fire
She ridin' me like +A Streetcar Named Desire+
Stop, drop, roll, and shake what her mama, gave her
Clap that ass like the choir
Ooh, I ran into my old thing
I said "Bitch you broke my heart, but that's just growin' pains"
But trust me, she ain't nothin' but an old flame
I threw water on that old flame, no more flames
I'm so glad I'm out the dope game
Cause now I got more time to burn in that pussy like some propane
Now that pussy is my domain
And I know they just don't get it, they just don't get it

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne - over Chorus]
Yeah... and they just don't get it
Fuck 'em, fuck it - they just don't get it
See we already, we already lit it
And now we on fire, we on fire
Yeah, it's me and you
Just don't get it, we already, we already did it
And now we on fire, we on fire, yeah

[Outro: Lil Wayne] + (Christina Milian)
(Let's start a fire) Mama I'm in love with a hot girl
And they just don't get it, they just don't get it
(Baby I'll be your gasoline)
Fuck it - cause mama I'm in love with a hot girl
And they just don't get it (let's start a fire, watch the entire)
(World as it opens up in flames)
Fuck 'em - cause mama I'm in love with a hot girl
And they just don't get it - Young Mula baby
