[Intro]
You who are rich and whose troubles are few
May come around to see my point of view (mm-hmm)
What price the crown of a King on his throne?
When he chained in the dark (HA HA~!) all alone

[Jadakiss]
I'm as real as they come, I follow the rules
I'm still in the hood, but I probably should move
Made enough money, I don't fuck around
I just felt they needed me, so I stuck around
Feds got my man, shit is real son
Cause my Godson just became my real son
Think life is a game, but all you get is a turn
You live and you learn, either you freeze or you burn
Kush in the air, I'm pushin the gears
Love turned into hate, hate turned into fear
If it ain't right, I don't sign the deal
Shoot me in the watch, I got time to kill
Gasoline... propane
Ain't no salary cap in the dope game
Ain't no collective bargainin on cocaine
So in other words nigga, do yo' thang

[Drake]
Mind in one place, heart in another
Please pardon my brother, he's just angry at you niggaz
who don't have yo' heart in yo' rap shit, and got too fuckin comfy
Cause we still fuckin hungry, Young Money got the munchies
Faded, fuckin faded, aww yeah I'm fuckin faded
They tellin lies about me, aww yeah I musta made it
Rikers Island on this flow, eight months for that pistol
But at least they had some bad bitches workin in that shit hole
Ahhh, three visits later, I went and did it major
So fuck the judge, and the jury, and the litigator
Watchin all these kids who thought they had it figured out
And then November came, they let my nigga out

[Lil Wayne]
Uhh~! Stop playin, I ain't with that bullshit
Niggaz act like bitches, Shanaynay, oh my goodness
This is Wayne's World, and y'all are just some tourists
Give me three wishes, I wish I wish I wish you would bitch!
Brand new pussy, pussy good as baby powder
Two glock 40's, nigga you got 80 problems
Swimmin in the money, I'ma need some fuckin goggles
It's better to give, but we don't give a fuck about 'em
I just came home, shit done got real hoe
Lil Weezy-ana, the boot nigga steel toe
I ain't workin with a full deck but I deal hoe
I just touched down, kicked a motherfuckin field goal
Talkin 'bout Baby money? I got your Baby money
Kidnap your bitch, get that "how much you love yo' lady" money
I know you fake nigga, press yo' brakes nigga
I'll take you out, that's a date nigga
I'm a grown ass blood, stop playin with me
Play asshole, and get a ass whippin
I think you pussycat, ha Hello Kitty
I just throw the alley-oop, to Drake Griffin
I lay 'em down, Tempurpedic
This shit's a game of chess, you niggaz think it's cleavage
It's Young Money, yeah 'tis the season
I give you the business, bitch this a business meeting
My niggaz hungry, my bitches greedy
Will I die a bloody murder? Dear Mr. Ouija
Nigga I'm straight, my girl a faggot
Potato on the barrel, pop pop, tater salad
UHHH~!
