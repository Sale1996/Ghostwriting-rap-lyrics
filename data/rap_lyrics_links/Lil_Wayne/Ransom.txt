Yea
Drizzy baby
You already know who it is
It the first time I'm high
It's the first time I smoked in like 3 months
I'm sorry mama, I had to do it to them
Forty I see you
O I see you homie
I stay late tonight right
You know what happen when I stay late
Yea
Boy wonder
I swear it's like this every single time
Toronto I got you
I got us
Yea

I'm a hard guy to get along wit
Get on a song wit
When shit be goin right well I just flip it to the wrong shit
The team that I belong to
The artists I put on wit
Don't ever ask for nuttin 'cause them niggas got their own shit
Me and Weezy are like a mouth of hot peppers
Black Ferrari with the red seats I call it playin checkers
I'm never doing verses I'm forever giving lectures
If you trying to meet with money I'll be happy to connect ya
Life is better than it's ever been
Schedulin' million dollar mettings with the president
Someone cut the lights on where is Thomas Edision
Gotta a new condo watch me as a settle in
I deserve a MTV show for me and my people
And if you tryin' to zone I got a whole Swisher Sweet full
Rappers are liars and their women are deceitful
Add until they subtract me, I'll never be your equal
Last place Drizzy is the nigga in the lead now
Weezy told me just write every single thing you need down
And he got it for me and I'm as happy can be now
Bout to start ballin' like I'm coming off a rebound
Yea, and I should have the most braggin' rights
Becuase the nigga spit crack, bag it tight
Hate when rappers say they tryin' to get their swagger right
Cuz I done came on more fire than a dragon fight
Fuck you pussy ass hater you should do you
You ain't heard of me then you should go in get a blues clue
Oops I'm mean a red clue
Wayne's here soo-woo
Bet he felt like the end of a pool cue
But I ain't bangin', I ain't waving no flag
I'm ATF but they ain't seeing no badge
It's Heartbreak Drake I hate to see him so sad
I can son you, see a little me in your dad
I'm the same yellow boy that used to play up on the Degrassi
Can pocket 20 thousand to be anywhere they ask me
Cash like Johnny, Banks like Ashley
Burnin' like a Camel Light stupid hoe ash me
But don't me shit about me
And no the game really aint shit without me
She might have to pay me but I dick her down free
Wanna know if it's the truth then pull the zipper down and see

[Lil Wayne]
No homo though...
Yea
Ummm.....I'm going in

Drizzy I got us
This is my promise
Ima bring the barrel to them bitches eyeliners
And what I make up, will fuck up your skin
I pick buck up and buck-buck then buck-buck again
I will butt-fuck your friend
Then suck up her twin
I put the buck-up to him
Then buck-buck and buck-buck and buck-buck again
Suck nut you duck, fuck your unloving kin
Now don't rub it in
Like Lubriderm on a new tattoo I had to
Kick my princess up out my castle
Dad, who? Never had that dude
Always had a black tool
Even when I was at school
Cuz bullies aren't bullet-proof
Red scarf hoody too
Probably ain't as hood as you
Stupid motherfucker the only thing in the hood is you
I do everything as good as you no I do everything better
I get paid for everything for every letter, A-B-C, et cetera
Fetch a bone
Like a dog motherfucker I am gone for your neck
In a sec, intercept
Bring it back like work in a trunk
And my exit coming up yo I am headin' to buck like
Buck-Buck again
Might fly to L.A and just fuck Karrine
Nahh fuck Karrine
Lets get bucks again, and fuckin' spend
Them bucks and then, just fuck Karrine
If I told ya I'ma do it I did it
Got my city on my fitted
Bout to pop a lets get it
Lets get it motherfucker whatcha waitin on
It is bout a minute past pissed and I'm about to get shitted
I'm wit it if money is the it you want me wit
And I prolly just spit on the chick you won't be wit
And I hate a boney bitch only like I'm only think
And I own hip-hop, if you don't spit I'm gon' evict
And I just sold a lot of property to a buyer
And I think his name was kinda like Drake Drizzy Rogers
Or Drizzy Drake Rogers I'm too busy to play father
And when it comes to the game I'm too willing to play harder
So harder I go, there he go
They chant MVP when I shoot a free throw
C.E.O., Jazz what it do
The haters are there facin' and their ass is a shoe
Faster than you
Badder than you
Radder than you, et cetera
I told ya, I get paid buy the letter like
A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P-Q-R-S-T-U-V-W-X-Y
ZZ Top, yes we rock
And me and Drizzy both wrote on Detox
That was just a foot note
How long can he could he go
Wondering when he stop
Bitch when the beat stop
So I'ma keep rock-in to the sheet rock bend
Then the heat I send burn skin
The end
