Too many women and not enough time
I'ma kool kat but I'm on life nine
pimpin ain't dead cuz I be the life line
And I don't buy the bar cuz it don't sell white wine
goone let that light shine
ballin for a life time
smokin on that nice pine
weezy baby life fine
you can call him ya husband
call me at night time and even thoe women change I will always like dimes
And yea I'm quite fine but shawty much finer
And I jus get behind her den smack it like a honda
And please don't hate on me when you see me with kiana
cuz she wilder than Nirvana and colder than your honor
Holla at yo boy ma√±ana Maybach come wit a recliner
run up on me and shit will get uglier than an iguana
this is only a reminder, its young money don't forget it
And I'm Weezy F baby you might find it on her titty would ya

pass me the dutchy wit ya left hand
I got the whole club noddin like the yes man
I'm in my polo tee, cooji sweat pants
She on that jubilee I'll be the ex-man

pass me the dutchy wit ya left hand
I got the whole club noddin like the yes man
I'm in my polo tee, cooji sweat pants
She on that jubilee I'll be that ex-man

Chillin wit my posse bout to call sum ladies over
tell em dis is why your me so when you come you can leap over
you would think she came wit buttons by the way that I control her
put her on a tab now she rollin like a baby stroller
I'm the freshest and the scene reppin in my jeans
shoot ya lights out I be ready wit the beam
lifes a game of chess and I'm headin fa ya queen
not my stomache and my thighs but her head is in between
She wetter than a stream I drink medicine to lean
keep a cup in my head like I'm beggin for sum cheese
I fall off in the party yea I'm kinda tardy
but if a hater trip we ride on him like a harley
look you call it gettin married I call it actin selfish
my belt got g's on it like a packers helmet
And I'ma hit if you bring ya girl around
but the weed its like a collar cuz I might jus turn it down if ya

pass me the dutchy wit ya left hand
I got the whole club noddin like the yes man
I'm in my polo tee, cooji sweat pants
She on that jubilee I'll be the ex-man

pass me the dutchy wit ya left hand
I got the whole club noddin like the yes man
I'm in my polo tee, cooji sweat pants
She on that jubilee I'll be that ex-man

{Gudda}
Tool on deck I'm new born fresh
I knock ya friends down and you goin next
young money fly nigga all the bitches after me
murdered in the bed and you gone be my next casualty
automatic stick but I give it to her manually
I'm givin dick out year round and you can get it anualy
styrophoam filled wit a strawberry fanta treat
leanin I'ma need a kick stand to stay on my feet
get out my business like I kicked ya out my office
I ain't worried bout the price I'm mo concerned with the offer
fresh to death like I got dressed in a cauffin
wit a party and my pocket blue and red dolphins
I'm high as a muddafucka lemme do my thang bitch
I'm doin me and yo girl doin the same shit
I'm in the car gettin head as our lanes switch
Double G I do my thang bitch now you cud

pass me the dutchy wit ya left hand
I got the whole club noddin like the yes man
I'm in my polo tee, cooji sweat pants
She on that jubilee I'll be the ex-man

pass me the dutchy wit ya left hand
I got the whole club noddin like the yes man
I'm in my polo tee, cooji sweat pants
She on that jubilee I'll be that ex-man

I told you catch up did you make a mill yet
I can't predict how many of em I can still get
october gone its such a fuckin real set
no tats but the ink on my money still wet
life is such a beach its sandy all around me
I came here wit young money man dats family all around me
I'm in my living room and I got grammys all around me
And famous bitches doin nose candy all around me
welcome to the life the life is meant for me
my bentley has a tint and so you got to squint to see
I hollered at ya girl das when she went wit me
but please don't blame ya self cuz it just wasnt meant to be
dey say I'm one of the illest ask ya self for first impressions
And my cards always accepted I don't deal well with rejection
I look in the dictionary and don't see the word recession
I don't smoke in public but tonight I'll make an exception so jus

pass me the dutchy wit ya left hand
I got the whole club noddin like the yes man
I'm in my polo tee, cooji sweat pants
She on that jubilee I'll be the ex-man

pass me the dutchy wit ya left hand
I got the whole club noddin like the yes man
I'm in my polo tee, cooji sweat pants
She on that jubilee I'll be that ex-man
