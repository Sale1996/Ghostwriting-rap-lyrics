Uh...
Dana texted me and say she wanna see me..
Then send a picture of her in a mirror..
No clothes on, of course..  
She want that dope dick; hello world, I'm the dope dealer..
I love it when she talk crazy..
That dick make her walk crazy..
That last time was awesome..
All the lines, we crossed them..
I ain't a killer, but don't push me
I OJ Simpson that pussy
Hehe, that's the shit 
Pussy taste so good make you smack ya lips
I don't know about you, but I'm a beast with mine
She said she waitin for "Tha Carter 69"
Heh, I told her "Sorry 4 The Wait"
I value her time like an Audemars-Piguet
And we gon' stay current like the water in the lake
Yeah, we gon' fuck around like we fuckin in a circle
Heh, pardon the slur, that's the purple
It feel so real like it's virtual
Any kind of position, she's versatile
Man, she take it every way except personal, haha
Yeah, that's my bitch 
Pussy wetter than a wishing well, I wish 
I was in it right now instead of makin this song
Hut one, hut two, I run it in the end zone
Don't trip when I say I cain't see ya
And she say she workin on her career
Smoke got our eyes lookin like we from Korea
We floatin, but I'ma +Rock the Boat+ like Aaliyah 
R.I.P., shawty got me
But shawty knows I fucks her with her hard body
Shawty fine by me, spend some time by me
It's a jungle out there, come and climb my tree
I know it's on your mind...fine... 
And we can do whatever that is
She tell me that it's fine... I say fine... 
Shit, I was taught to live and let live 
So gon' live it up baby, giddyup baby
It's your world, ain't tryin to interrupt, but
maybe we movin too fast, but fuck it let's crash
One day we gonna have to leave our love in the past
But for now, I feel lovely, I feel great
Slide in her -- safe
Hehe yeah-yeah, all that good shit
No I ain't a player, I just play her by the bush
And I know what I'm doing and she love how I do it 
She throw that ass back and she never over-do it 
She call me baby and I call her bay  
Sorry 4 the Wait, "Carter IV" on the way~!
August 29...

Hehahah! Yeah.. Fuck with me Drizzy, gone
