[Lil Wayne]
Sleepin at the top, nightmares of the bottom
Everybody want to be fly til you swat 'em
But who am I to talk? I ain't shittin roses
We in the same picture but we all got different poses
Now I'm lookin in my rearview; I see the world in it
I try to slow down, and I get rear ended
Pause! Like a red light I'm dead right
+Highway to Heaven+, God do you see my headlights?
They say you don't know what you're doin 'til you stop doin it
Well call me clueless cause I do this
Attention all shooters, I'm a shootin star
Life is a course, and I'ma shoot for par
Searchin for today, instead I found tomorrow
And I put that shit right back man I'll see what I find tomorrow
Young Money CMR, blood like a scar
Weezy F baby and the F ain't for Flaw, uhhh
Uhh! Yup, yup, yup, yup

[Lil Wayne]
It's like I have it all, but I don't have to worry
Married to the money, a true love story
Only God can judge me, I don't need a jury
Nothing standin in my way like nothing's my security
Back to my journey, that bullshit don't concern me
If I knew I was going to jail I would have fucked my attorney
If you sleepin on me nigga, then I hope you toss and turnin
I'm so cold I'm hypothermic, ask your bitch she will confirm it
Yeah~! Now what we doin with it?
Keep openin your grill, I'm barbecuin with it
I know my shit already tight so I ain't screwin with it
Some say this game is a joke, well I hope they get it
Okay I'm walkin on needles, stickin to the point
Yeah the streets is talkin I'm familiar with the voice
I'm a gangster by choice I hope my sons choose wiser
And don't call me sir, call me sur-vivor, uhh
Yeah! Uhh... hehehe
Yup! Yup! Yup! Yup!

[Lil Wayne]
Uhh, call me killer cause I make a killin
I got this shit wrapped up, bow and a ribbon
That's them twin Glocks, you could call 'em siblings
And them bullets travel, better hope I keep dribblin
I touch the sky, get the clouds out my fingernails
These bitches think they fly like Tinkerbell
But they all on my +Wire+ like Stringer Bell
I let 'em be, cause you know how that stinger feel
Know how to whip that white girl, I can spank her tail
And I fuck up any track - train derail
Know how to roll, never need trainin wheels
And when the truth hurts, I pop pain pills
Uhh, all or nothin or nothin else
I bleed reality; I should cut myself
Just had a bowl of riches, and a cup of wealth
And the F is for +Fuck Yourself+
Uhh! Yeah, and I ain't doin nuttin
but gettin my share, breathin this air
And Mack moms told me she gonna keep me in her prayers
So I'm feelin alright, I'm tryin to stay aware
And if you wanna trip, then I'ma meet you there
To my niggaz in the game, keep the game fair
Players play, coaches coach, and cheerleaders cheer
I'm tryin to keep spirit when the ghosts disappear
Weezy F baby and the F ain't for fear, uhh!
