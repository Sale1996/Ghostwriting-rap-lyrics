[Lil Tjay]
Ooh, yeah
Lil Tjay

[Lil Wayne]
So I'm skrrting off the scene in a foreign, see me goin'
Me and YG up in Cali smoking GT out the bong (Ooh)
Shawty pulled up in a thong, I don't know what she on (Ooh)
If she ask to spend the night then I might give her what she want

I got to put my Perc' in, it's workin'
Lil Mama, say she nervous, yeah, sure bitch
I just want a lil' mountain, lip service
Treat it like a house, she want insurance
I'ma fuck her good one time, let her unwind
She gon' tell me where to come at, I'ma come fly
Put my thumb up in her yeah, yeah, she gon' jump by
I'ma fuck her like a madman, I ain't even mad, man
She gon' do a handstand or standing ovation
She rub my red flag, I call her Rozation
She get the pedi and the manicure, but no facial
Natural beauty, I'ma call your mother, "Mother Nature"
Under the covers, she know Tucnechi like the Undertaker
Girl that's my pussy, she say, "Daddy, that's an understatement"
I got it leaking like a pool lane
She call me Tunechi, when we fuck, she call me Tunechi

[Lil Tjay]
I got up out my Birkin, it's workin'
She said she a virgin, it's hurtin'
But she ain't never show me love when my pockets hurtin'
Now she see a nigga on, she fucking and slurping
And they see me puttin' on and it got them nervous
We don't never need to ball, I did it on purpose
And I used to play the block with the fiends, got some knots to my jeans
If a nigga talk hot, we gon' pop for his bean (Nah-nah)
I'm coming strong and they knew that
You ain't no competition, boy, don't think you wanna do that (I'm like)
You had your chance, but you blew that (Lil Tjay)
Everybody asking who that? (Oh, no, no, no, no)
The fuck going on?
Someone in my circle started leaking all my songs
I'ma stay ten toes, I'ma still go strong
I don't get these snake niggas, we just can't get along

So I'm skrrting off the scene in a foreign, see me goin'
Me and YG up in Cali smoking GT out the bong
Shawty pulled up in a thong, I don't know what she on
If she ask to spend the night then I might give her what she want
Fuck her one time, maybe two times if she do fine
Make your boo mine, I'm in the stu', this my new grind
I'm cooking up, I'm cooking up, ain't tryna lose time
I shoot it up, don't give a fuck, ain't tryna lose mine

Gangbang, growing up I was Stain Gang
Stain Gang, promise I was only tryna maintain
Lil TJay SB, that's the gang gang
Ask about me, bet they tell you how my name ring
And I know they gon' hate 'cause I'm up now
I'm at the point where I don't really give a fuck now
Free the guys, I'ma say it 'til they touch down
One day everybody have a bustdown

So I'm skating off the scene in a foreign, see me goin'
Me and YG up in Cali smoking GT out the bong
Shawty pulled up in a thong, I don't know what she on
If she ask to spend the night then I might give her what she want
Fuck her one time, maybe two times if she do fine
Make your boo mine, I'm in the stu', this my new grind
I'm cooking up, I'm cooking up, ain't tryna lose time
I shoot it up, don't give a fuck, ain't tryna lose mine (Dystinkt Beats)

[Lil Wayne]
Yeah
Gang, gang, pulling up
I was stain gang, stain gang, pulling up
Promise I was only trying to maintain
Lil Tunechi, YMB, that's the gang, gang
Lil Tunechi, YMB, that's the gang, gang
And I know they gon' hate 'cause I'm up now
I'm at the point, I don't really give a fuck now
Free the guys, I'ma scream it 'till they touch down
Lil Tunechi, YMB, that's the gang, gang
