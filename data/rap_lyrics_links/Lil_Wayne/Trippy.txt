[Intro]
(We trippy mane!)
(Mane, mane, mane, mane, mane, mane, mane...) Uhh

[Lil Wayne]
Blue skies, blue skies, I see you with my red eyes
Bust yo' fuckin grape nigga, turn yo' shit to red wine
Don't fuck up my high nigga, I'm too gone - bye nigga
She get dick weed and ignored, that's a D.W.I. nigga
My skin crawlin, my walls talkin, the pictures in here lookin at me
The ground movin, I'm seein shit, I'm blowin like I'm stuck in traffic
I'm smoking on that strong, got me +coffin+ like I'm gettin buried
I've been fuckin Mary Jane, I knew her when she was just Virgin Mary
I'm stoned, +Mick Jagger+, I can run around Saturn
Eyes rollin back, and keep blinkin like hazards
I said king me, king me with my mushroom, crown on
I graduated to better drugs, my cap and - gown on
Don't knock me off my high horse, what I do is my choice
I'm high as the scoreboard, bitch look up at my points
I'm trippin out, cotton mouth, I got high and fell asleep loaded
I woke up and got high again, "Okay! I'm reloaded"

[Chorus 4X: Juicy J] *
Weed, pills and that drank
That's my trippy kit {*3X*}

* 4th time "That's my trippy kit" doesn't repeat in first Chorus

[Lil Wayne]
Shout out to my weed man, shout out to my lean man
Pussy-ass nigga wanna spark somethin, I'm a gasoline can
I'm high nigga don't blow it, I trust it far as I could throw it
I don't know if I'm comin or goin, T make my blunt a Samoan
And I see lights flashin, life passin, take a bitch home fuck like rabbits
Styrofoam cups and wine glasses, shot glasses, hot flashes
My tongue numb, I can't talk, no balance, my spine hurts
My mind surf, my eye jerks, I try different drugs, I'm diverse
Goodbye Earth - farewell; high as heaven, eyes low as hell
Keep scratchin, keep bitin my nails, keep lightin an L, I'm a kite in the air
I like weed brownies and cookies, I'm straight but seein crooked
I got my trippy kit, I hope I trip and fall in some pussy - Tunechi~!

[Chorus]

[Juicy J]
Musty herb in a ziplock, twisted off top notch
Weed that I smoke, straight off a boat
Six foot bong, tryin to see what I toke (see it!)
This that Cali kush I motivate not gloat (mm-hmm)
All I need is Mary, let the models do the coke
Tryna get some Becky in the backseat of the ghost (ghost)
Hit the weed man, tell him that I need a bag
Wake up e'ry mornin and I take a drag (we smokin!)
Take the blunt, dip it in the lean then I laugh (you know what it is)
In your baby momma ear and I'm gonna smash (bitch)
They call me the Trippy King, don't try me nigga (turnt up)
Juicy J with the Taylors, Chinese eyes nigga (turnt up!)

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Uhh!
Man fuck these ol' bitch-ass niggaz
