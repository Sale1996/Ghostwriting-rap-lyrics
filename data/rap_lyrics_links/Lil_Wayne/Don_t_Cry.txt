[Intro: Lil Wayne]
Yeahhhhh, C5

[Chorus: XXXTENTACION]
Don't cryyyyyyyyyyy
Don't gooooooooooo
Won't liiiiiiiiiiie
I fucking love youuuuuuuuuuu, whoa

[Lil Wayne]
Why I'm staring into the clouds
Am I rising or they comin down?
I see death around the corner
And the U-turn sign's lookin like a smile
What do I do now? Who gon' find me, how?
Nowhere to turn but around and 'round
Just another nigga that done lost his head
No, a fuckin king that forgot his crown
I am not number one, it's true
I'm number 9-27-82
Color-blind even if I may be blue
A lot on my plate, ain't my favorite food
But I'm hungry, so hungry
Need my family tree next to a money tree
with a bunch of leaves in the Garden of Eden
With a bunch of Eves, no fruit punch for me
I sip from the Fountain of Youth
So if I die young, blame the juice
Bury me in New Orleans
Tombstone reads: "Don't cry, stay tuned"
Bring me back to life
Gotta lose a life just to have a life
But if heaven's as good as advertised
I want a triple extension on my motherfuckin afterlife
Rest in paradise

[Chorus] - 2X

[Lil Wayne - over Chorus]
Don't cry, don't cry
Oh why, oh why...
Whoa
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry
Why, oh why, oh why, oh why
Don't cry, don't cry
Don't cry, don't cry

[Lil Wayne]
Talent is God-given, be grateful
Fame is not a given, be humble
And conceit is self-driven, drive carefully
Stay in your own lane, seat buckled
And sometimes when there is, no music
We toot our own horns, rum-bum-bum-bum
That woman carried, the future
And Tunechi was born like, "Dun-dun-dun-dun-dunnnnn"
Don't call it a comeback
It was dark, now the sun back
Hit me hard, but I punched back
The wheels fell off, I rode the hubcap
Is it suicide or it's do or die?
It's newer days and it's bluer skies
I told myself, "It's just you and I"
Then the breeze came and it blew my mind
Lord knows who I'm there for
I give my last breath of air for
Momma tell me to be careful
Voice in my head give me an earful
But I got mind control over my control
I lost control but knew I'd find control
I let God control what I cannot control
Can't control the tears, let 'em drop and roll

[Chorus] - 2X

[Lil Wayne - over Chorus]
Don't cry, don't cry
Why, oh why, oh why
Don't cry
And triple extension on my motherfuckin afterlife
Rest in paradise
Don't cry, don't cry
Why, oh why, oh why
Don't cry
Don't cry

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Don't cry, stay tuned...
And triple extension on my motherfuckin afterlife
Rest in paradise
