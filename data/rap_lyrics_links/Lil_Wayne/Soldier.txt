[T.I] (Destinys Child)
Hey
(I want a Soldier!)
The way you got it, I'm the hottest around
They'll know it when they see you rollin' impala's around
(I got a Soldier!)
Wit the top down feeling the sounds
Quakin' and vibratin' your thighs ridin' harder than guys
Wit the chrome wheels at the bottom, white leather inside
When them lames be spittin' at you tell 'em don't even try it
To shot it wit Chelle and kick it wit Kelly or holla at B
Ya, gotta be g's you way outta your league
Please!

[Kelly] (Destinys Child)
We like dem boys that be in them lac's leanin'(Leanin')
Open their mouth their grill gleamin'(Gleamin')
Candy paint, keep that whip clean and (Clean and)
(They always be talkin that country slang, we like)
They keep that beat that be in the back beatin'(Beatin')
Eyes be so low from there chief (chief and)
I love how he keep my body screamin' (Screamin')
A rude boy that's good to me, wit street credibility

Hook: [Destinys Child]
If his status ain't hood
I ain't checkin' for him
Betta be street if he lookin' at me
I need a soldier
That ain't scared to stand up for me
Known to carry big things
If you know what I mean
If his status ain't hood
I ain't checkin' for him
Betta be street if he looking at me
I need a soldier
That ain't scared to stand up for me
Gotta know to get dough
And he betta be street

[Beyonce] (Destinys Child)
We like dem boys up top from the BK (BK)

Always ridin' big on the freeway {Freeway}
(Wit that east coast slang that us country girls we like)
Low cut caesars wit the deep waves (deep waves)
So quick to snatch up your Beyonce (Beyonce)
Always comin down poppin our way (Our way)
(Tellin us that country girls the kinda girl they like)

Hook: [Destinys Child]

Bridge: [Beyonce] (Destinys Child)
I know some soldiers in here (Where they at, where they at)

Don't mind takin one for me (Where they at)
I know some soldiers in here (Where they at, where they at)
They wanna spend that on me (Where they at)
I know some soldiers in here (Where they at, where they at)
Wouldn't mind puttin that on me (Where they at)

[Lil Wayne]
Hey, see cash money is a army
I'm walkin' wit purple hearts on me
You talkin' to the sargeant
Body marked up like the subway in harlem
Call him, weezy f baby, please say the baby
If you don't see me on the block I ain't tryna hide
I blend in wit the hood, i'm camouflage
Bandana tied, so mommy join my troop
Now every time she hear my name she so ..umfÂ…

[Michelle] (Destinys Child)
I like dem boys over there they lookin' strong tonight (Strong tonight)
Just might give one the phone tonight (Phone tonight)
Homey in the dickies in my zone tonight (Zone tonight)
He don't know it might be on tonight (On tonight)
Ooh he lookin' good and he talkin' right (Talkin' right)
He the type that might change my life (Change my life)
Everytime he look at me my girls be like (Girls be like)
(That one may be the one tonight)
