You hear a smash on the radio!
Aye!... You hear a smash on the radio
Sean Garrett... T-Pain you ain't gonna believe this
Sean Garrett... Lil Wayne you ain't gonna believe this

Pull up on the beach it was 95 degrees! aY!
My nigga Pain said you ain't gone believe your eyes
almost turn the deep ova comin to a screech
Because it was "Girls On Girls on Girls on Girls" On
We was... we was M-I-A-M-I
And the girl spanish so I said hi!
Then I saw my sista's kissin white girls asians
Cause it waz "Girls on Girls on Girls on Girls" on

Hold up!... Heyy!...

It was jam pack we was straight mind blown
They dippin like Caribbean divas!
Girls in them teeny tops leanin from the liquor
Pool site was jumpin like a wild alligator
Malaysian cutie on this one
On-a... On-a... baby from Boca Raton
Both sides turning into a movie
I just shot in my bedroom and
They both took it to the head and we was like
Uhh Ohh!
She was lookin back at me like there's no denyin'
While she gettin hers she giving me the eye!
Damn I like her angle with them bangles
And them thick thighs
Kinda remind me my old chick on 05,
She was limba like a ballerina
She was so outrageous had to put this on tweeda!
Her girlfriend say watch me make her say AY!
"Girls On Girls" on Girls on Girls!...

[Chorus]
Pull up on the beach it was 95 degrees! aY!
My nigga Pain said you ain't gone believe your eyes almost turn the jeep over comin to a screech
Because it was "Girls On Girls on Girls on Girls" On
We was... we was M-I-A-M-I
And the girl spanish so I said hi!
Then I saw my sista's kissin white girls asians
Cause it waz "Girls on Girls on Girls on Girls" on

[Lil Wayne]
Weezy Weezy Weezy Weezy Weezy... Weezy F Baby beach bum swagga
Pull up on the beach met a bitch named Sandra
Talk that shit get her to my sand castle
Take her off your 2 piece leave on your sandals
Told her I'm a beast she said Si she speak Spanish
Tan butt naked make the panty line vanish
The sun fell down and burned me on my crown
And now my head smokin like the heat in Miami
South beach killa she feelin me I feel her
She say she got a man but I'm realer, I steal her
Thief on the beach there's freaks on the beach
We do it on the beach and let the water touch our feet
That's sex on the beach whatcha know about it
Girls on girls I build a girl mountain
It's young money yee ain't gotta count it
Girls on girls nigga I'm surrounded

[Chorus]
Pull up on the beach it was 95 degrees! aY!
My nigga Pain said you ain't gone believe your eyes almost turn the jeep over comin to a screech
Because it was "Girls On Girls on Girls on Girls" On
We was... we was M-I-A-M-I
And the girl spanish so I said hi!
Then I saw my sista's kissin white girls asians
Cause it waz "Girls on Girls on Girls on Girls" on

Part 2 night fall party still blowin
And it started raining on the beach
now we in the club n we done went from rockin itty bitty pink bikinis
To those jeans and them shirts
And some of them rockin skirts
Fell in love is it the drink?
I'm feelin love it's not the drink!
Cause her nationality I couldn't tell ya wat it be
But I knew she was a freak
The way she moved to the beat! Uh huh!
She standin on the bar everybody clappin
She done took off almost everything
Like ain't nothing happend
Pointin at me pokin' at me
Got me soakin wet making all types of bets
Sayin she can't stand her EX!... (Uh Huh)
Spillin drinks all over me!... (Uh Huh)
Turing round askin what I think
Her body bangin teeth white sexy as Beyonce
I'm feelin like BIGGIE!... UH!... Baby baabbyyy!

[Chorus]
Pull up on the beach it was 95 degrees! aY!
My nigga Pain said you ain't gone believe your eyes
almost turn the jeep ova comin to a screech
Because it was "Girls On Girls on Girls on Girls" On
We was... we was M-I-A-M-I
And the girl spanish so I said hi!
Then I saw my sista's kissin white girls asians
Cause it waz "Girls on Girls on Girls on Girls" on
