[Intro: DJ Drama]
I mean it's simple, you can't fuck with us

[Lil Wayne]
I got money on yo head, I don't do my dirty work
I cut off my hands, I don't even touch the work
I pray these niggas donât fuck with me and I don't like to curse in church
And my girl pussy, taste just like Mrs. Butterworthâs
I mean that... believe that...
Don't be short with that work nigga, we find out where yo ho work nigga
We follow your moms from church nigga, you gonna have to swallow yo pride like a thirst quencher
Get 'em Tune! I don't really fuck around with certain niggas, fuck all y'all niggas except my niggas
These niggas hustlin' backwards, check ya rearview mirror and your side mirrors
OG kush keep my mind clearer, that chopper get yo mind right
I got two choppers, that's chopsticks, eat yo block up like shrimp-fried rice
Been so long since I seen my eyes white, you know I smoke like dry ice
Better stay in yo lane or get sideswiped, it's going down, let me straighten up and fly right
Still can't turn a hoe into a housewife, man it's like some things will never change
You ain't got a shot in a gun range, these chumps ain't even got chump change

Uh, yeah, and don't fuck with me, you know I'm Gotti
Yeah, check yourself before I sign it
Yeah, I'm shinin' on these niggas, no horizon
Yeah, and it's goin' down if I'm her pilot
Uh, my new car is so robotic
My new bitch is so provided, money talks, yours like no comment
Black car, racial profilin', rest in peace to Christopher Wallace
Desert Eagle like the Mojave, I get my work from Rico Suave
Uh, it's a Rollie if I got time on my hand
You ever see me broke? Write on my cast
Boy my weed so good, I cry when it's gone
Had a phone in jail, that's a cellphone
Yeah, I'm bout to buy a machine gun
We drink it all, leave clean cups, make mountains look like speed bumps
I'm sittin' on some train tracks, hopin' that bitch speed up
I'm strong-armin' these niggas, roll my sleeves up, yeah
I got bad bitches on standby, all my hoes got cat eyes
Celebrate when a rat die, make a nigga fall back like he gettin' baptized
Put me in a hospital room, full of flat lines, I'm Tunechi Lee immortal
My name ringin', my name ringin', hello may I take yo order?
I say, testarossa over testimony
Got so much shit built up you could smell it on me
Fuck all y'all niggas in Swahili, nigga
Ainât nothin' +Free+ round here but +Willy+, nigga
AK-47, call it Mr. Biggs
All my niggas blood, fuck yo syringe
Chop his head off, put it in the fridge
Try not to mistake that shit for dinner
Dedication

[T.I.]
Ay, ay
Hey let me introduce you nigga to America's most
Every nigga round with me carry a tote
Sadity bitches like a nigga Tune on the low
They just be like ten and be doin' the most
Okay, Tune in the jet flyin' over the boat
I'm on the way from the Panama, I got a few on the boat
What you niggas make a year, I could do with the blow
You keep on playin' with me, bet I'll put a few in you hoe
The fate of a fuck nigga, we soon to see
These niggas sweet as perfume to me
I mean really like cartoon to me
Ain't nobody fuckin with Tune and me
Hustle Gang, bang green, in God we trust
Young Money, Cash Money, they down with us
I got a bitch who want yo bitch, you finna give the hoe up
And don't buck, shawty listen, you don't really know us
We bust a nigga head, leave him layin for dead
I get caught with a banger, I'ma lay in the feds
In gen pop, nigga everyday in the feds
I was chillin' on the yard, really goin' hard
And these pussy niggas catchin' feelings over broads
King pussy nigga but I'm really like a god
Hey, A-Town nigga, Bankhead I'm about it
Everybody know to fuck with me cause I got it!
