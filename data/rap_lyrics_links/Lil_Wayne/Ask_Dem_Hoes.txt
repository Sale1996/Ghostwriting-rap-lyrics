Yea buddy, Weezy F. Baby Baby
Yea, my type of shit
See, when I do what I do, I do it
I said when I do what I do, I do it
Dat right

[Lil Wayne]
See, she all on my dick, cause I make alot of money
But I unno why, cause she gets none, bring it back...
All on my dick, cause I make alot of money
But I unno why, cause she gets none from me
She only get dick, way down in her tummy
And she tell all of her friends, now her friends wanna, bring it back...
Only get dick, way down in her tummy
And she tell all of her friends, now her friends wanna fuck me
I'm lookin in the mirror, and I see a dollar sign
I had a cat scan, and I had money on my mind
I tell a bitch go and get my name on ya spin
So I can feel good, when I'm hittin it from behind
I'm crack rock fresh, baby I'm that boy
Now put me in a pot and watch I come back hard
Yea put me on that block and watch I come back rich
Now she done put me in that pussy, she aint come back since

[Chorus + Hook]
Ask dem hoes, yea ask dem hoes
Ask dem hoes about me, ask dem hoes
Mmhmm, yea ask dem hoes
Ask dem hoes about me

I'ma beast, ask dem hoes
I'ma dog, ask dem hoes
I'ma beast, ask dem hoes
I'ma dog, ask dem hoes
Bitch I'ma beast, ask dem hoes
Hoe I'ma dog, ask dem hoes
Bitch I'ma beast, ask dem hoes
Hoe I'ma dog, ask dem hoes

[Lil Wayne]
Hat to the side, rims on the ride
It can't fit in my pocket and I don't have, hold up...
Hat to the side, rims on the ride
It can't fit in my pocket and I don't have to cock it
Scarface bitch, cocaine by the pie
Got them hoes sniffin, like dem hoes about to, hold up...
Scarface bitch, cocaine by the pie
Got them hoes sniffin, like dem hoes about to cry
Ms. MySpace don't blow my high
I download hard dick, to your hard drive
Den she got on her knees and soon we locked eyes
She caught it, like it was a routine pop fly
I'm dope boy fresh, new jeans, new everything
Dem bitches want me, like a wedding ring
I told her dat, I'm married to the money, committed to the cash
All I see is pussy, titties, and the ass

[Chorus + Hook]

[Lil Wayne]
Call me Weezy F. bitch I'm straight from the street
Dope game is sour, and the dope is sweet
I live in the tower, got a scope on the heat
Hit you from 100 feet, we don't even have to meet
Ya bitch love me, we don't even have to meet
But if I run into her, believe me I will, hold on...
Ya bitch love me, we don't even have to meet
But if I run into her, believe me I will do her
And if that bitch is crazy, believe I will sue her
Got some hungry-ass lawyers, that would eat her up and chew her
I don't know why you love her, I wish I never knew her
She only give me brain, she was just another tutor
She blow my whole band, I was just another tuba
Now get off my dick, and get lost in Aruba
It's money over bitches, Cash Money over bitches
Young Money over bitches, get money from them bitches
I do!

[Chorus + Hook]
