[Intro]
You know I've been talkin shit for a generation now
'Bout that time for me to kick my feet up
Y'know? Move on to other endeavors
Who's ready to take the torch?
Somebody? Anybody?
Haven't I taught you everything?

[J. Cole]
When this shit dropped I was like 16
Tryin to get some head from a mixed thing - big dreams
Say goodbye to ripped jeans, nigga got a job
Had my little wad, worst fear was getting robbed
For my last fifty dollars that I had left over
5 dollars in they pocket, nigga in his left shoulder
Minimum wage, $5.15
13's on the whip, kept my shit clean
Actually that was my momma shit
But I'm drivin 'round town on my Obama shit
Middle-class my ass, just to get a tank of gas
had to run the guns up the street and pawn the shit
But, yeah I'm headed for a scholarship
Lil' scrap game, but I got a lot of lip
Thats why them niggaz don't like me and always wanna fight me
A dumb nigga hate a smart mouth, most likely
I know the game, I'm a expert
Nigga, how you gonna jump me if my legs work?
Nigga I'm gone! Showed up at the crib tryin to bone
And I ain't fuck yet cause her momma always home
God damn, L-Lord have mercy
Please God don't let this little broad have herpes
My nigga say she fast like Jackie Joyner-Kersee
Gold medals if we gave hoes medals
No rose petals on a bed in the ghettos
Spiderman sheets got her singin falsetto
Tall white tees, can't believe we used to wear those
White folks lookin at us like we're weirdos
But we was only kiddos
Grabbin titties in the club, pocket full of Skittles
Tryna get the kitty was like tryin to solve a riddle
Tryna get to Diddy, cause I murder instrumentals
This that good old fashioned Mark Jackson
Fucked then I'll pass, y'all Utah Jazz'n
And ya'll borin', I don't play nigga, I'm Mark Madsen
Thats why my knots thick like a fuckin Kardashian
I'm not askin my nigga I don't need favors
I'm in the streets with the fiends, I done seen danger
My team major, we party like teenagers
I'm in the green Range, nigga I'm the Green Ranger
{Gangsta Grizzill!} Team major, we party like teenagers
I'm in the green Range, nigga I'm the Green Ranger

[Lil Wayne]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't even like this beat
But fuck it
I'ma only spit like a few bars cause I don't like the beat
Bitch I'm not old news, I'm more like gold shoes
She eat my whole dick, she like Whole Foods
They say I'm old school, but I dropped out
Drop your body off, at a cop's house
They throwin up them bricks, you better box out
My niggaz got enough white to build Barack house
I got my drawers on, Sam Rothstein
Forty-four on my waist, Rick Ross jeans
I've been faded, stone wash jeans
New pussy, new money, New Orleans
50 up in that uzi, G-G-G-Unit
I merc you with that bitch, scratch the serial number re-use it
I'm from the N-O, stretch niggaz out like limos
Uzi go zit-zit-zit-zit-zit-zit-zit, that's pimples
Ugh, I'm 'bout to go banana puddin
You a dyke cause your man a pussy
Hit you from the blindside no Sandra Bullock
Never bite the hand that feeds you always wash the hand that's cookin
Tunechi! Hahaha, +D4+ hoe
Shout out Cole
You already know what it is, "Cole World"
+Wayne's World+
We in this bitch hoe
Special delivery
At your front do', hahahaha
Ahhh redbone bitch!
