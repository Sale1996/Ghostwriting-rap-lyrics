[Intro: Lil Wayne] + (DJ Drama)
Yeeeeah~! {"David Banner"}
Uh-uh, uh-uh (Shoutout to Uptown!) {"David Banner"}
Come on, come on, come on, come on {"David Banner"}
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
{"David-D-David-D-David-D-David Banner"}
Jump for the 17, jump for the Hollygrove - uptown, uptown
Jump for the 17 - I'ma take it uptown, uptown (Hollygrove, what up?)
Holly-grove - I'ma take uptown, uptown, yeah
Yeah, ya dig
They already heard me, ya heard me? Uh-huh
You understand me - uh-huh
They gon' leave me, baby {"GANGSTA GRIZILLZ!"}
Check me out, look

[Lil Wayne - singing]
Woke one mornin'..
Woke one mornin' (uh uh uh) tears in my eyes (uh uh uh)
And you had left me without a kiss or a note or goodbye (uh uh uh)
Now I got (uh uh uh) to learn to live alone
But my heart can't take it, I guess that's why I wait by the phone
For a call, a call from you
Sayin' she needs me back, just as much as I, need you
But I guess for the time, you need to stay away (uh uh uh)
Let me tell you baby, now I'm thinkin' of you every day

[Chorus 2X: Lil Wayne w/ ad-libs]
I'm thinkin' about you
I'm thinkin', I'm thinkin'
I'm thinkin' about you
I'm thinkin' about you

[Interlude: Lil Wayne]
Oops, up-side your head
I said "Oops, upside your head"
I said feet, don't fail me now (Oops, up-side your head)
I said feet, don't fail me now (I said "Oops, upside your head")
White man came down to my city
On my corner and asked me what do I do?
I said "I do what I wanna"
I said "I do what I wanna"

[Lil Wayne - singing]
I keep thinkin' 'bout the good times we had
And how we let jealousy turn all we had good into bad
Now I realize, if you just try it again
Love will play out, you'll be my girl, I'll be your only man

[Outro]
"David Banner" {*2X*}
"David-D-David-D-David-D-David Banner"
