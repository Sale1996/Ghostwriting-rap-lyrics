[Future]
I see funny faces
Oxy-Oxy, Oxycontin
For the world
Oxy-Oxy, yeah freebands

Oxycontin, oxycontin
Oxy, oxy, oxycontin
Look at my wrist, oxy
Look at my bitch, oxy
Oxycontin, oxycontin
Oxycontin, oxycontin
Look at my bit, oxy
Look at my clip, oxy

[Lil Wayne]
Medicine Man
Medicine Man taking off never to land
United we fall, together we stand
I pop a whole she took a half
I'm feelin' gold she lookin tan
It never gets old she never gets mad
We too high to fuck, I never hit that
Cotton candie sweet as gold
Make that pussy open close
She take her meds up her nose
Looking like she smell a rose
It says Hermes on my clothes
20 mg, that's my dose
I fucked her off one of those
She act like she saw a ghost
Wake up baby, comatose
Wake up baby, vamonos
Sleeping like we on an island somewhere in Galapagos
Its lonely at the top we hold hands, Geronimo
100% cotton oxymoron, oxycontin

[Future]
Oxycontin, oxycontin
Oxy, oxy, oxycontin
Look at my wrist, oxy
Look at my bitch, oxy
Oxycontin, oxycontin
Oxycontin, oxycontin
Look at my bit, oxy
Look at my clip, oxy

Macha, macha, nigga stop it
N'ms always trappin' contin
Drinkin' sake, hope she toss it
I eat beef, Johnny Rocket
Open the bowl, in the faucet
Break that hoe, John Gotti
Be afraid, get the pocket
Pocket watch, pick a pocket
Bitch, it be a problem
Got me lookin' cocky
Juugin' in the lobby
Catch ya dripping' shawty
Cuban link, my wallet
And it's camofâlaugin'
It ain't no discussion
Better hit your target
Bentley with the roof
Got Versace carpet
Sippin' lean like soup
Yeah, Hatchatashi
I'ma pop the X, I'ma try the oxy
I just tried, ooh, I can't feel my body

Oxycontin, oxycontin
Oxy, oxy, oxycontin
Look at my wrist, oxy
Look at my bitch, oxy
Oxycontin, oxycontin
Oxycontin, oxycontin
Look at my bit, oxy
Look at my clip, oxy

Freebands!
Yeah I got some pills
Yeah I got the Perc
Yeah I got this big booty bitch in my vert
And I got a room, and it's downtown
And my wife...
