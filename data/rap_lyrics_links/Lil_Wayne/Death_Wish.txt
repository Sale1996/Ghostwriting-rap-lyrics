Death wish, death wish, death wish, death wish
Death wish, death wish, death wish

[Jadakiss]
AH-HAHHHH!
Yeah, yo, they must got a death wish
Cause they was on the +Road to the Riches+ 
back in the day, but they got off on the exit
Real disrespect shit - whenever a nigga 
try to fuck up your investment, it's hard to digest it
These young niggaz don't wanna get punched in they faces
So they keep the burner on 'em, and catch a bunch of cases
These old niggaz still think they livin in the 80's
And shorties that they knew since they were babies turned crazy
The bitches still holla
At anybody lookin like they gettin a couple dollars
Could fuck, suck and swallow
Ain't nobody winnin, but everybody can't lose
The dirt's still there, funeral home ain't move
Goin in, comin out gang affiliated
You'd rather go back before bein humiliated
A black cloud over the hood, you can't escape it
Dust smokin niggaz walkin 'round in the +Matrix+
Loyalty is thin, the tension is thick
Look at a broke nigga's face, when you mention a brick
Stick-up kids come around, when they sense that you rich
Candles and lizzle get lit when you get hit with the fifth
Niggaz that used to hoop dream is now sellin the piff
And they still rattin but you can't tell if you stiff
Especially when the tec spit
Fuck around get your head, and your neck hit, lookin for a death wish
What?

[Chorus: Jadakiss]
Talkin out your mouth, all reckless
To a nigga that you know, that'll let it off, that's a death wish
When your heart stops, and your body gets breathless
And help don't come in enough time, that's a death wish
When you see the blood and realize that your chest is hit
And don't know where it came from, that's a death wish
When you know a nigga, whole styles on some next shit
And you violate 'em, mm-MWAH, that's a death wish

[Lil Wayne]
Young Money!
Ahh, I be on that way left shit
Better get right or get left shit
Better hit right or get left hit
Even if you threw the best pitch
Yes bitch it's Weezy-F bitch, I'm the best bitch
Motherfuck yo' guest list, I be like, let's just
kill him and get breakfast, neck slit
Next shit expect this, every time you check this
I'm exit, I mean, excited to be yo' death wish
Bitch I wear this G shit on my heart, not my necklace
And I keep the Heckler for the heck-less
And I'm from the Mecca of the Reckless with a record-breakin death list
The reckless and neglecters think election won't affect us
I'm high above you, above law, above ever rich
Niggaz snitchin, put niggaz in a can like a beverage
Damn! I pop at your head, fuck up your memories
I put a bullet in Nina head and let her reminisce
Yeah, if you don't remember shit you gon' remember this
I'll knock them niggaz down this year, I'm on my timber shit
Big lion growl at you niggaz on that Simba shit
I'll be on that "Fuck yo' clique, I'll kill every member" shit
Cold as December shit, bang in any weather shit
And they could buy yo' bag with body parts sold separate
Yeah, that's a bet bitch like Russian Roulette bitch
Weezy be the genie in a bottle, here's your death wish

[Chorus]
