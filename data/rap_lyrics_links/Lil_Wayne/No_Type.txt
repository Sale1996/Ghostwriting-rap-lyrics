[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Cause I ain't got no type, no
But when I met codeine, it was love at first Sprite
Countin' dirty money all night, where the wipes?
I like my Swisher Sweet fat as fuck with cellulite, yeah
My bitch got a wife, yeah
Got me walkin' 'round feelin' like Dolemite
And these niggas talkin' crazy but they don't get out of line
They pockets sayin' "vacant" and my shit say "occupied"

[Lil Wayne]
Yeah, bad bitch on my team, mmm
Bad bitch on my team, just like Katniss Everdeen
Got lipstick everywhere
I got her shakin' on this dick-dick-dick-dick-dick-dick like a, electric chair, Lord
I got liquor, I got cigarettes
And these pussy ass niggas just got PMS
I don't think you should see him nor live off per diem
She just took off her clothes and said "You ain't lyin'"
She pretty like the bride of Frankenstein
She kill it like she married to the mob
I can't let one of these hoes lock me down, momma
She said "Don't worry son, I'll help you make bond
Cause these hoes throwin' pussy like hand grenades
Don't let it blow up in your face now"
Had to buy my dick a barricade
And a mothafuckin' K9
Diamonds in my teeth, I'm eatin' carrot cake
So, hard for me to put on a fake smile
I had to buy my dick a barricade
Yeah, and a mothafuckin' K9
I got cocaine, I got cigarettes
I don't do neither, it's at my bitch request
She like bad boys, I'm her crook in the neck
Her suicide note say she love me to death
Ooh, for her Lewinsky is so critical
And I didn't mean to get political
I watch her, let her figure slither
But I don't look into her snake eyes

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I ain't got no type, no, mm
But when I met codeine, it was love at first Sprite {"EarDrummers"}
I been countin' dirty money all night, where the wipes?
I like my Swisher Sweet fat as fuck with cellulite {"Mike WiLL Made-It"}
Ooh, my bitch got a wife, yeah
Got me walkin' 'round feelin' like Dolemite
And these niggas talkin' crazy but they don't get out of line
They pockets sayin' "vacant" and my shit say "occupied"
Yeah... but when I met codeine, it was love at first Sprite
I been countin' dirty money all night, where the wipes?
I like my Swisher Sweet fat as fuck with cellulite
Ooh, my bitch got a wife, yeah
Got me walkin' 'round feelin' like Dolemite {"EarDrummers"}
And these niggas talkin' crazy but they don't get out of line
I'm +Sorry 4 The Wait+ til I drop that "Carter V" {"Mike WiLL Made-It"}

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Yeah, these hoes throwin' pussy like hand grenades
Yeah, don't let it blow up in your face now
Mm, yeah, had to buy my dick a barricade
