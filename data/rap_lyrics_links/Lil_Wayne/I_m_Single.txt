[Lil Wayne]
Uh, camo shorts and bubble Kush...
Yeah, we can talk, she'd rather fuss..
This and that 'bout such-n-such, man...
Damn, where is the fuckin trust?
I'm tired of the hoop and holl'n
I'm 'bout to take the Coupe to Collins
Uh.. then take a female to the Island
Uh, then take her clothes off and do the honors
Yeah, now she hear I'm wit dem other bitches
Yeah, I told her mind her fuckin business
Hehehe.. Shit, she prol'ly out chea fuckin niggaz
I'm fuckin her friends, now her friends ain't even fuckin with her
Damn, she text me all day and night
So pissed off she ain't even spellin shit right
I text her back, and tell her, "It's life"
Now somebody tell them hoes I'm single for the niiiight

[Chorus]
...Yeah I'm single
Nigga had to cancel that bitch like Nino
I ain't trippin on nothin, I'm sippin on somethin
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me
And I'm single, yeah I'm single
And I'm single, tonight I'm single
I ain't trippin on nothin, I'm sippin on somethin
And my homeboy say he got a bad bitch for me tonight

[Lil Wayne]
Uh, dreads braided to the back
I'm chillin but my swag on full attack
Hahah... and my girl actin like a brat
So when she call, I don't answer, I just write her back
...She hate it when I do that shit
And I when get home, she go thru my shit
She call numbers back, to see who that is
...Man, I hate it when she do that shit
...Polo t-shirt, Polo draws
...Now make me take this Polo off
Heheh... Girl, you can get broken off
Yeah, I fuck you for an hour then I smoke it owww-ff
Swimmin trunks and bathing suits
Then go in the bedroom and tell the naked truth
Don't wanna fuss, ain't tryna fight
Man somebody tell them hoes I'm single for the niiiight

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
Uhh, now she got on her fuck 'em dress
..and I got on my double breast
Uh, and he been fussin all day wit her
And I make her feel special like a place kicker
She wanna be Weezy F. Babysitter
Say she wish she could cut my dick off and take it wit her
I say, "Hold on," she say she just playin
Then I falls in dat pussy like quicksand
Uhh, hot sex and cold wine
She left that nigga hangin like a clothes line
I cut my phones off -- both lines
It's bout to get nasty -- pork rinds
She came hard -- both times 
We both say we single, and we both lyin
We both wrong, but it feel right
Putcha hands up, if you single for the niiiight

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne - Outro]
Yeah..
If you singlllle, putcha hands up (uh)
If you singlllle (uh) putcha hands up (uh)
I-If you singlllle (uh) putcha- if you single tonight
And I ain't trippin on nothin, I'm sippin on somethin
And my huh-boy say he got a bad bitch fuh me 
I ain't trippin on nuh'hin, I'm sippin on suh'hin
And my HUH-boy say he got a bad bitch for me tonight
Yeaaaah, HAHAHAHA~!!
Ahhhh, lemme cut my phone back on, man (If you singlllle)
Yeaaaah, sorry baby, but I gotta go home (YEAAAAAH)
It's morning
