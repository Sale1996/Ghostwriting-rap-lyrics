Typed by: AZ Lyrics

(Yeah, I know that I'm winnin')
(I'm winnin', I'm winnin', I'm winnin', yeah)
(Yeah, uh, I know that I'm winnin')
(I'm winnin', I'm winnin', I'm winnin', yeah)
(Mustard on the beat, hoe)

(I'm rare, I'm rare)
(I'm rare, I'm rare)
(I'm rare, I'm rare) (This shit hard)
(I'm rare, I'm rare)

Like a 2 dollar bill, like a 2 dollar bill
Like a 2 dollar bill, like a 2 dollar bill

(I'm rare, I'm rare)
(I'm rare, I'm rare)
(I'm rare, I'm rare)
(I'm rare, I'm rare)

Spit cold shit, need Mucinex
Diamond chain 'round my neck with the crucifix
Got a family now so I had to pipe down
Before a young hoe fucked up my timeline
I wear my shades at night like Corey Hart
Stopped trappin' and the plug said I broke his heart
On a seafood diet, I don't fuck with pork
Porsche and Mercedes drive, I got a lot of torque

Trap check, check, one two
She wanna spit, dip, fondue
Shinin', I'm in the sun room
Life a bitch so you better use a condom
I'm rare like a nigga that's loyal
I'm rare like a girl with me that ain't spoiled
I'm rare like Mr. Clean with hair
Yeah (I'm rare)

Like a 2 dollar bill, like a 2 dollar bill
Like a 2 dollar bill, like a 2 dollar bill

(I'm rare, I'm rare)
(I'm rare, I'm rare)
(I'm rare, I'm rare)
(I'm rare, I'm rare)

I'm rare
I promise, I swear
I'm high, mid air, don't vomit up here
Like the 13th floor, fuck it, I'ma take the stairs
Like what 2 Chainz wear, that shit from Rio De Janeiro
I'm rare like a commercial with Future and Cher
Like a cop that's fair, like a triple-double-dare
I'm rare
Really rare, you scared, you really scared
I'm where? I'm here and there
You stare, you disappear
Oh yeah, that's really rare
That flair, them semi's tear
That trigger softer than hair
Silencers, hearing-impaired
That's rare, shoot up a fair
That's rare, my goons don't care
They bears, might get the chair
Who cares, they say they prayers
Oh yeah, the claps drop
I'm rare, sasquatch
It's bare traphouse
Codeine mascot
I chill where it's hot
Brazil backdrop
I'm real, her ass not
I'm rare, Tunechi

Like a 2 dollar bill, like a 2 dollar bill (Mulla, that's mulla)
Like a 2 dollar bill, like a 2 dollar bill (That's rare, that's rare)

(I'm rare, I'm rare) I'm rare, I'm rare
(I'm rare, I'm rare) I'm rare, I'm rare
(I'm rare, I'm rare) I'm rare, I'm rare
(I'm rare, I'm rare) I'm rare, I'm rare

Real like real niggas, real like 12 figures
Real like Wagyu steak, real like 88 polaroid pictures
My bite is stronger than my bark, this shit like dog parks (Parks)
Treat the Bugatti just like a fuckin' gokart (Kart)
'Bout my business and my soil is my witness
Only fuck with real niggas, them fake niggas I had to dismiss
Fuck with 'em from a distance, I'm a tycoon
Hella sharks in this business, stay with a harpoon

I got game like Donald Goines
startup companies, crypto currency coins
Like a bicentennial quarter I'm hella rare (Hella rare)
I've been hustlin' since I was in daycare (Daycare)
Now I'm a motherfuckin' millionaire (Millionaire)
Money longer than Diana Ross' hair (Ross hair)
I'm rare like white running backs, T squares, a box of applejacks
I'm an innovator, a trend-setter, far from a copycat
I don't rap like none of you niggas, I'm one of one (One of one)
The baddest bitch in the world could suck my dick and I bet I won't cum (Bitch!)

Like a 2 dollar bill (I'm rare, I'm rare)
Like a 2 dollar bill (I'm rare, I'm rare)
Like a 2 dollar bill (I'm rare, I'm rare)
Like a 2 dollar bill (Bitch)

(I'm rare, I'm rare)
(I'm rare, I'm rare)
(I'm rare, I'm rare) Rare, rare
(I'm rare, I'm rare) Yeah
(I'm rare) I'm rare
(I'm rare) I'm rare
(I'm rare) I'm rare
(I'm rare) I'm rare
(I'm rare) I'm rare
(I'm rare) I'm rare
(I'm rare) I'm rare
(I'm rare) I'm rare

(I'm rare) I'm rare
(I'm rare) I'm rare
(I'm rare) I'm rare
(I'm rare) I'm rare
