I can't fuck with hoe niggaz
I can't trust these hoes neither
Wake up early in the morning
Eat that pussy like cold pizza
Hater ass niggaz be baller blocking
Acting like some goalkeepers
There's a reason for everything but
My niggaz kill for no reason
Camo shorts for the whole beater
All-black hoodie, I'm Grim Reaper
Look like its time for spring cleaning
Brand new spanking street-sweeper
Been in the game, I'm knee-deep
I like good head, I like good reefer
All my niggaz strapped and ready
To set it off: Queen Latifah
Got a chopper with a drum
Split Swishers with my thumb
Get money like Donald Trump
Double barrel on that pump
This kush I got ain't no chump
Get stupid and get stomped
Two girls I call criss Kross
Kriss Kross'll make you jump
Gotta do what a nigga gotta do
Got goons Äì I ain't even gotta shoot
Got a bunch of bad bitches by the pool
I like my bitches in twos
Gotta go, I stick it and move
G Code: I stick to the rules
Last night I got so high
I Swear to God, I went to the moon
I want that shit you can't get no where
You pussy boy, don't go there
If I don't do nothing, I'ma ball
No hair. Smoking on that "oh yeah"
My niggaz tote that hardware
What you bout woadie?
My niggaz about that warfare
Real nigga since day one
Cause I ain't promised day two
Throw that pussy at me
Bitch, I think I'm Babe Ruth
Drop top Maybach on the way
Yeah that's that new Land-o-Lakes
She hit me with her jungle
I'm gonna hit her with that rattle snake
Guns clap like patty cake
Blood gang red bandana face
Make them pussies pop theyself
You can call that "masturbate"
I don't front no fabricate
I get high, I gravitate
Weezy F Baby bitch
The F is for Fascinate
Louisiana from that swamp
I'mma pull this bitch out and dump
Better run like Forrest Gump
F-ck you and where you from
3-2 I am the one: job well done
I ball 24/7, 3 6 5, 12 months
Put some redbone, put some caramel
Come to Wayne's World, it's a fairy tale
Yeah I'm high bitch, bitch I para-sail
Carter 4 is late, sorry for the wait
