[Intro: Lil Wayne]
{*muttering*} Nigga!
I'm sorry for the fuckin' wait
Was busy, racin' Ferraris with Lil Reginae
That's gangsta, you know I always come in second place
You hatin', it's written all over your fuckin'

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Bitch, you jealous
Woo! And I was right
Yeah, hehe, bitch, you jealous
Stuntin' on these, stunt, stunt, shit niggas don't like
Hehe, tell a fuck nigga "Bitch, you jealous"
I'm sorry for the wait, apologetic
Yeah, uh, bitch, you jealous
Now give us our cash and our credit
Pop, pop, sorry for the

[Lil Wayne]
Ridin' around like Pablo, still talkin' that blanco
My Nina sing soprano so we gon' leave on a high note
Come out my shell like Raphael, and crack yours like a taco
Lil Wayne tougher than John Wayne, make him change his name to John Doe
It's me and my lil brother Capo, Lil Marley G and my bottom bitch
If I'm fallin', it's bottomless; if I'm trippin', it's a power trip
Her pearl tongue like the pearly gates and with that said, I climb the fence
My other bitches gotta ride the bench and with that said - bitch you jealous
I'm fly like my dreadlocks propellers, I think I should headline Coachella
My woman a queen like Coretta and nigga, you sleep with the Devil
I couldn't be Jr. forever, I don't mean to ruffle your feathers
But I had to spread my wings, ain't trying to get lemon peppered
Got too many pistols, too many issues, too many mistakes, too many miscues
Only made me better, it turned me into the man I am today, I'm new and I'm improved
I got my shit right, it's just you and a tissue, suit yourself because this suit is a rental
Now the snow is just comin' in like I broke a window to an igloo
Slow a bitch down like un momento, I'd rather get screwed than scrutinized
I'd rather get used by a cutie pie; if she ain't fuckin', it's uber time
I rather be advised than supervised, you do the math, we do the numbers
We pour champagne and expensive wine in water guns and shoot each other, uh
I get high, meditate like a monk, preposterous when I get drunk
And my goons is wilder than Gronk, my do's is as bad as my don'ts
Met a kinda-cute bitch with a donk as long as the bitch got a donk
And I smell like pussy, money and weed, she said "Ooh, I like your cologne"
The last niggas tested us flunk so please study hard, study long
Kill your wife then take the bitch phone and text you to please hurry home
And the rain drops turn into blood, look like you just come in from a storm
And if all pussies come with walls, I hope you run into your own
Nigga I come with that heroin flow, I come with that never before
My CMB days are dead, I ain't worried 'bout ghost, I married the MOB, we divorced
Woo! And all that shit dead with out me of course it's nothin', a zombie, a corpse
You burnt yourself and was suppose to pass me the torch; fuck it, I'll see you in Forbes nigga
... I'm sorry for the fuckin' wait
Was busy, searchin' my calender for better days
I found 'em - you either turn the page or tear the page
Y. M., Young Money, never age

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Bitch you jealous, woo!
And I was right, yeah
Tell a fuck nigga "Bitch, you jealous"
Stuntin' on these, stunt, stunt, shit niggas don't like
Yeah, hehe, bitch, you jealous
I'm sorry for the wait, apologetic
Hey, uh, bitch, you jealous
Now give us our cash and our credit
Hey, pop, wait
