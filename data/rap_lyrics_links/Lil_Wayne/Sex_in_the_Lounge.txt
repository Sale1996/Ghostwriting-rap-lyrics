[Intro: Bobby V]
Yeah, Bobby V yeah
Deejay turn me up!
Don't you turn this down
No no

[Nicki Minaj]
I think I gave him, a discrete name
He replied, with a street name
PR, at the Heat game
No ball, repeat game
He addicted to hustle, I'm addicted to fame
Though he packin that muscle, I'm addicted to brain
I'm addicted to chillin, make a hell of a killin
Don't I stunt on these bitches? Man I'm bad as a villain
Get the gun I'ma hunt 'em, when I'm done, I'ma done 'em
When we leaving the lounge, I'ma keep it a hundred
It went down, 'nuff said~!
Pull off in that thing and it's blush red

[Chorus: Bobby V]
Sex in the lounge, girl I'm gon' take you down
I'm gon' have you screamin girl, they gon' hear the sound
of our sex in the lounge
I can't believe this is happenin to me, girl
Happenin to me, girl
Oh I

[Bobby V]
So caught up in this girl, shorty got me all tricked out
Can't control myself, cause I'm so into her
Cause we doin it like nobody's around
And when we doin it, I can hear her make a sound
Shorty was in gear, like me
Had that girl singin, singin like me
She be like oh-oh-ohh, oh-oh-ohh, oh!
Oh-I, I, I, I-I-I, I, I, I
Whoahhhhhh, she lookin at me like she want it
But I'm over here
Ohoahhhohhh, she cumin on top of me
I'ma make her scream, her scream

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
... Sit that pussy on my bottom lip
Then after that, you know we gotta switch
My house so big that bitch came with a lobby
We didn't use a rubber, but I came on her body
I lay her down and kiss her neck and talk dirty to her
Like I get that pussy wetter than a dirty sewer
Fuck with me, turn around and bust it open for me
Get on that dick and get that money; go Oprah for me
All your girls don't like me cause they know you love me
But if you scared, go to church, it's open Sunday
I-I-I dig, I dig in that pussy, guess what I found?
Tunechi Lee and Nicki, sexin around

[Chorus] - 2X
