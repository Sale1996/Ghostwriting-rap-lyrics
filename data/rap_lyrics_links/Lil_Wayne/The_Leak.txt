[Verse 1: Lil Twist]
It's the microphone killa
Microphone wrecka
Call me mr. Twist himself
The young chubby checker
Like young money young'n
When no playn the boy
But I jet
And I am your favorite kids choice award
Nick at night another year
And my girls know miley cyrus

But the money keep flowin
Like the jonas on the island
Jonas brothas I'm so illy
Like look VIC I'm so so silly
Like I'm sittin in the lab with Jae Millz you gotta feel me

WAIT

Young mula baby
Yeah we so crazy
And I am so amazing
And ya'll are so lazy

Call me jeezy baby
And please don't try to play me
Yeah
You gonna need more than god to come save me

WAIT

That's my savior
Church, now I'm missin ya
Eyes burnin everyday, I'm sayin like I'm mase'n ya
Then I hit tha harlem shake
They like look Lil Twist you mazin now**
Then I hit the back space
Now Lil Twist erasin ya
Nah I'm just show casin ya
If a test I'm a'sin ya
If you the young and I'm the cap
I can't belive no chasin ya
And with these jew els boy I can't feel my face
And I open up your top
Now the now the kid wastin ya
Intelligence the lil that you had
I'm the big bad wolfs dad
Homie no comparin me to no one
Espeacially you I'm in the league next to u
Oh I bumpd u

And I'm ooo who weee
Awsome
Greatness
That's I
U can see me with no eyes
Flyer than a birds sight
No lie
Why should I
I'm fly high
Like jim jones song
We ballin
When I was born to skip college
Straight running this game
No shame
You lame and rap should be my middle name
Lil Twist and young game
No roka fella ella
This rap game ain't easy
Oh wait it is easy when your big brothers WEEZY
GO!

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Brand New money, br-brand new bostin'
And ya act brand new and get a brand new coffin
Lil bro I got ya hold ya weight and I'm a spot ya
All ya need is the combination to the locka
I'm the hip-hop rocka
I'm the hip-hop docta
I'm in tip-top shape and my flip flops gucci
Drinkin sacky, eating sushi with a bunch of bad groupies
I swear I'm a walking movie, you ain't even gotta cue me
And baby I'm the **** you ain't even gotta do me
Cause ain't no one gon do me better than I'm a do me
So so I'm a do me
My WATCH SAY TIME TO DO ME
U don't kick it like I kick it, bitch I kick it I'm kinda bruce lee
I'm the shooter behind the shooting I'm the looter behind the looting
And I got so much swagger I swear swagger tryin to sue me
Yo girlfriend trying to new me
I mean she trying n to get to kno me
She say that she will do all kinds of crazy shit to know me
Ok Lil Twist I'm Kobe but I'm shooting like Ginobli
No one after, nor before me I go to earth when mars is boring
What am I worth? you can't afford me
But ya baby moms adore me
She wanna read my tattoos like a mothafukin story
That's another fukin story
Well we get to that later
U don't kno what your in for, and call me mr.data
Or you can call me it's the greatest or for short just the greatest
I swear I walk right on the lot and bought the longest mercedes
It's WEEZY baby hoe
Turn up ya radio
I'm in the penthouse fucking on the patio
She call me daddy yo
She don't wear panty hoes
And when I'm done watch out I do magic, make her vanish yo
But she was spanish though, and I like them spanish hoes
Yeah two of them and one of me's a weezy sandwich hoe
But I be like damn them hoes, I am an animal
I am the chief of the tribe like a seminol
Crazy like anne nicole
But I'm expanding tho
Man I swear I don't need security
I need fan patrol
And I am Young Mula
And so is Twisty baby
And you ever forget that
And don't forget the baby
GONE
