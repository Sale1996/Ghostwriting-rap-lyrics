I did it for everybody out here on their own<end_line>
I did it for the ones who walk a mile in them cages<end_line>
And never tell me no<end_line>
Come get me when I fall, and tell me when I'm wrong<end_line>
But you should know I bought 'em<end_line>
I changed it, I changed it<end_line>
They say that shit the same, it ain't the same, though<end_line>
I changed it, I changed it<end_line>

Oh my God, I changed it<end_line>
Oh my God, they still on the same shit<end_line>
You can't say nothin', you can't say nothin'<end_line>
You end up everywhere you say you wasn't<end_line>
Is that your boyfriend? Why you say that's your cousin?<end_line>
I don't do handshakes, that shit disgusts me<end_line>

No more seein' visions, I changed it<end_line>
Young Money shit, Mula Gang shit<end_line>
Different hoes doing the same shit<end_line>
Poppin' pills, we don't know where the pain went<end_line>
Lit like high beams, sippin' on my lean<end_line>
Rippin' off my wings, knife out my spleen<end_line>
Yeah, Carter time, I put bling on for the time<end_line>
She changed her ringtone to one of mine, I changed 23s to 45s<end_line>
Lil Tune like autotune, I get in her throat and she harmonize<end_line>
She get the D and ooh la la la, and when she leave, I kumbaya<end_line>
I whip it up with the left hand, I don't fuck with the yes man<end_line>
I get younger by the second, I don't rust like Def Jam<end_line>
It's a must I expand, and flex on my ex-team<end_line>
Have sex on my jet ski, text my chef, told 'em "Let's beef"<end_line>
Changing girls, change is fine<end_line>
She don't like girls, change her mind<end_line>
Change the world, change my line<end_line>
Never ever change my slimes<end_line>
Changing looks, changing lies, changing skies, changing lanes<end_line>
Me, Minaj, and Champagne changed the game<end_line>
And y'all chump change<end_line>
I'm just sayin'<end_line>
