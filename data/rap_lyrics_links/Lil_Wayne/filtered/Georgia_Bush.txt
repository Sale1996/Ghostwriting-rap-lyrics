This song is dedicated to the one wit the suit<end_line>
Thick white skin and his eyes bright blue<end_line>
So called beef wit you know who<end_line>
Fuck it he just let him kill all of our troops<end_line>
Look at the bullshit we been through<end_line>
Had the niggas sittin on top they roofs<end_line>
Hurricane Katrina, we shoulda called it HurricaneBush<end_line>
Then they tellin y'all lies on the news<end_line>
The white people smiling like everythin cool<end_line>
But I know people that died in that pool<end_line>
I know people that died in them schools<end_line>
Now what is the survivor to do?<end_line>
Got to no trailer, you gotta move<end_line>
Now it's on to Texas and to<end_line>
They tell you what they want, show you what they want you to see<end_line>
But they don't let you know what's really goin on<end_line>
Make it look like a lotta stealin goin on<end_line>
All them cops is killas in my home<end_line>
Nigga shot dead in the middle of the street<end_line>
I ain't no thief, I'm just tryin to eat<end_line>
Man fuck the police and presidentBush<end_line>
So what happened to the levies, why wasn't they steady?<end_line>
Why wasn't they able to control this?<end_line>
I know some folk that live by the levy<end_line>
that keep on tellin me they heard explosions<end_line>
Same shit happened back in Hurricane Betsy<end_line>
1965, I ain't too young to know this<end_line>
Young President Johnson but now it'sBush<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I was born in the boot at the bottom of the map<end_line>
New Orleans baby, now the white house hatin, tryin to wash away like we not on the map<end_line>
Wait, have you heard the latest, they sayin you gotta have paper if you tryin to come back<end_line>
Niggas thinkin it's a wrap, see we can't hustle in they trap, we ain't from<end_line>
Noooww it's them dead bodies, them lost houses, the mayor say dont worry bout it<end_line>
And the children have been scarred, no ones here to care bout em<end_line>
And lash out, to all the rappers that helped out<end_line>
Yea we like it they call on y'all, but fuck presidentBush<end_line>
We see them Confederate flags, you know what it is<end_line>
A white cracker muthafucka that probably voted for him<end_line>
And no he ain't gonna drop no dollas, but he do drop bombs<end_line>
R.I.P. Tig' cause he died in the storm, fuck presidentBush<end_line>
See us in ya city man, give us a pound<end_line>
Cuz if a nigga still movin then he holdin it down<end_line>
I had two Jags, but I lost both them bi-tch-es<end_line>
I'm from N.O. the N.O. Yea!<end_line>

Money money money get a dollar and a dick<end_line>

Bout to go get surgery and put some diamonds on my wrist YES<end_line>
Yep, I'm a muthafuckin trip<end_line>
I'ma trip to Japan and buy some brand new shit<end_line>
Nine hundred to a grand, get you twenty eight grams<end_line>
If you talkin bout bricks, I'm the interstate man<end_line>
And the women say damn, them niggas don't say a damn thing<end_line>
Boy I bet that shotty make you bounce like a bed-spring<end_line>
Walkin a thin line, gotta defend mine<end_line>
And wit no pen I'm sorta like a bomb BOOM<end_line>
Young toon, yea that's what my people call me<end_line>
Fifty thousand for the cause, tryin keep the reaper off me<end_line>
I drink a lotta syrup, bitches say I'm sleep walkin<end_line>
Big money for the grill, so I'm never cheap talking, yea<end_line>
Keep talking and the flame leap off the hip<end_line>
And keep sparking, pap pap sleep softly<end_line>
Yea, nap nap, nap sack, three forties<end_line>
Like fuck another nigga, nigga just don't be da target<end_line>
Young New Orleans nigga, nigga just don't be retarded<end_line>
We done lost everythin and you lookin like a bargain<end_line>
Purple weed, purple drink, purple heart sergeant<end_line>
I'm the best rapper in the game no argin<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
And I don't ever write, pause<end_line>
Un-pause this, so keep ya bitch ass lines inside the margin<end_line>
Lil Wayne dot com bitch log in<end_line>
Put a pillow under your knees and keep ya jaws in<end_line>
All in ya girl mouth, use her like a toilet<end_line>
They usually want a baller and the young nigga ballin<end_line>
Mike Jordan, pardon my swag<end_line>
Even my father rich as fuck and all my brothers left the family<end_line>
We said fuck it bought two houses in Miami<end_line>
I can't wait to do cribs, MTV c'mon get at me<end_line>
Any rapper wan get at me, tell ya label contact me<end_line>
Half four hundred for a feature, wanna battle, I'll beat ya<end_line>
I'm a beast, I'm a preacher, I'm the son of miss cita<end_line>
Mom dukes, my jeter, she the reason, she the reason<end_line>
Everybody woman wanna beat a boy diva, not even<end_line>
There's a 305 dime I wanted ever since I seen her<end_line>
Got a topic of this evenin, hotter than a tub steamin<end_line>
Gotcha girlfriend dreamin of one day bein Trina<end_line>
Notta sim seemer, ten ki's in the Beamer<end_line>
Got a white girl drivin, couldn't do it much cleaner<end_line>
I'm fly in the sky like that muthafuckin ribbon<end_line>
Bitches got my name on em, and the nigga still livin<end_line>
Spend a condo and a club, one bottle won't do<end_line>
Two bottles won't do, bottles for the whole crew, thanks<end_line>
And bring me that Patrone, I don't play<end_line>
No ice I like my drink straight, not gay<end_line>
And bitch that bank come everyday, I'm paid<end_line>
I wish a nigga come invade, get sprayed<end_line>
I stomp a nigga out like I got ten legs<end_line>
Then they fish the nigga up out the lake in ten days<end_line>
Behave, no ho, I'm on that Rage Rov<end_line>
Cash Money, Young Money, ho that money age old<end_line>
And can't a cage hold this animal from Hollygrove<end_line>
Sorry mami I be stoned, I be, I be, I be blowed<end_line>
Got me copy rock star, Weezy Baby fuck these hos<end_line>
Gotta pay me now for me to even take these hos<end_line>
Price sizin for a show and the flow<end_line>
So either Drama is my nigga, or that boy got doe<end_line>
Go figure that's my nigga, that's my nigga, my nerve<end_line>
If anybody else want it, sixty thousand a verse<end_line>
<verse_end>
