Pocket full of money and some dark shades<end_line>
Flow so current he can start waves<end_line>
Game like butter he Parkay<end_line>
Love me some head like shortay's<end_line>
Coppin quarters like the arcades<end_line>
Getting high with my animals in our cage<end_line>
And you can see us if we start gaze<end_line>
Creole boy maybe I saut√©<end_line>
On your mark, ready, start race<end_line>
That's just you making my heart race<end_line>
And I may be the opposite, but I'ma let cha operate, yeaah<end_line>

And I know she wants the D-boy<end_line>
So I'ma pop on her like kee-loy<end_line>
And I got that magic like Bruce Leroy<end_line>
If this isn't it, then love got a a decoy<end_line>
Ger body sicker than retard<end_line>
And I bet I got the medicine she need for it<end_line>
And I bet I got the medicine to keep going<end_line>
She shoots me happiness and I bleed joy<end_line>
No band-aid for me boy<end_line>
