<verse_start>
I can hear the reaper comin'<end_line>
But I ain't scared<end_line>
Oh, no, no, I ain't runnin'<end_line>
Now when I walk past<end_line>
You might see an extra shadow<end_line>
Angels on my shoulders<end_line>
Are usin' me for a battle<end_line>
Spiritual warfare, good versus evil<end_line>
I even fought the demons as a semen<end_line>
Yes I was brought there<end_line>
Cursed ever since my day of birth<end_line>
Got a Heaven-sent flow<end_line>
Though, it's Hell on Earth<end_line>
So wit' that in mind, I don't live for Prada<end_line>
I'm tryin'a stack n' mack, and got stigmata<end_line>
Tryin'a get the same fan base as Big Poppa<end_line>
Sometimes when I flow<end_line>
They say the southern Big's popped up<end_line>
They tell me "don't get mur'd, or get locked up"<end_line>
But I'm from Holly Grove<end_line>
I can't give the block up<end_line>
So til' the day they drop my box, fuck<end_line>
I'ma ride wit' my Glocks up<end_line>
You already know<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I say, Miss America, Land of the Free<end_line>
You ain't never do nothin'<end_line>
For a brotha like me<end_line>
You sold me a dream of forty acres and a mule<end_line>
Then you turn that half-a-acre that I had, into a pool<end_line>
You get up on the news, lyin' bout how the levy's broke<end_line>
Now Weezy lost two Jags, and spitta's Chevy broke<end_line>
Flooded out engines, messed up suspensions<end_line>
You took everything we had<end_line>
Uncle Sam, you Satan fan<end_line>
