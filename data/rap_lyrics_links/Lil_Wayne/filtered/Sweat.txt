Sweating so hard you need three or four towels<end_line>
Shawty wanna be my boo like showtime at the Apollo<end_line>
Weezy F, the F for follow, follow me straight to my condo<end_line>
And get freaky bring you over, hit that ass just like a rhino<end_line>
I'm from Hollygrove, I still hang with L<end_line>
I make them bitches, they waiting to exhale<end_line>
I'm on some gangsta shit, I knock your head off<end_line>
You bark up my tree, that's a dead dog<end_line>
Where them hoes at? tell 'em I said wassup<end_line>
I like a shaved pussy, no razor bumps<end_line>
Yeah, YMCMB, when I step on stage, them hoes sweat like I'm Keith<end_line>
