<verse_start>
I'm a lover not a fighter, I can't find my lighter<end_line>
My house is four stories, I tell'em I don't write 'em<end_line>
And my living room is white, my lies are much whiter<end_line>
My darkest secrets are bright - I need a sun visor<end_line>
I say "187", make your bitch run my errands<end_line>
I'm at the bar with a Dracula orderin' Bloody Mary's<end_line>
I got a house on the prairie, got a corpse in the basement<end_line>
I see hell out the window, man this view is amazin'<end_line>
And if I go back to jail, Persian rugs in my cell<end_line>
Got the world in my hands; it got all under my nails<end_line>
In a room full of stairs, give 'em something to see<end_line>
I be so fucking faded - who washed the colors with bleach?<end_line>
Now they bitin' my style, hope it get stuck in yo teeth<end_line>
I been had the green light, so don't jump in the street<end_line>
The world's under my feet, I'm just kissin' the sky<end_line>
Tune, what is that smell? That's the shit on my mind, hah<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Uhh, breakin' up the kush, sticky fingers-onics<end_line>
I'm throwin' up gang signs, you can see I'm in my vomit<end_line>
And I'm cool right na' but please don't change the climate<end_line>
Cause I'm sleepin' with the enemy in bulletproof pajamas<end_line>
I got issues bigger than you, bitches taller than me<end_line>
Ratchet and bougie -- I like R&B<end_line>
Unapologetic, I'm sorry for not being sorry<end_line>
You niggas old news - prehistoric<end_line>
I need Benadryl for my trigger finger, bad bitches for my home boys<end_line>
The grass is greener on the other side, I'm focused on my own yard<end_line>
Ain't got enough, need more dough, we twisting blunts like torsos<end_line>
I'm +Rich as Fuck+ but more so, a poor soul<end_line>
Oh well, If snow fell like hoes fell in love I be a snow man<end_line>
My bitch a die for me, she a soldier - GI Joe-Ann<end_line>
Take chances when I know I ain't got no chance, roll 'em<end_line>
I left that crap table with a chip on my shoulder<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
We ain't got no motive, we just killin' yall for nothing<end_line>
And my bitch got cotton mouth, you know them snakes cannot be trusted<end_line>
And I bet y'all niggas don't say shit, because I'm feeling lucky<end_line>
And I still pray every night that aliens abduct me, Tunechi<end_line>
Whattup Khaled?<end_line>
