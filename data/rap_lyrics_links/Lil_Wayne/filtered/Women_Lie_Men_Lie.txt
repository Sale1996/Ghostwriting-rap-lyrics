YOUNG MONEY~! YEAAH!!<end_line>
Okay, I ain't gotta lie, cross my heart, hope to die <end_line>
Them numbers don't lie, G5 over sky <end_line>
I fucked her pussy good, make her cry if I tried <end_line>
But I'm tired of bein sick, and I'm sick of bein tired <end_line>
Tired of these niggaz, and tired of these bitchez <end_line>
And shit, let 'em lie, long as they ain't snitchin, ha ha! <end_line>
And men lie about women <end_line>
and shit... women lie about plenty <end_line>
And they ain't lyin on me <end_line>
I'm in the bed with two fine bitches lyin on me <end_line>
so that would make three, and numbers don't LIE<end_line>
and money don't LIE, and neither do I, bitch!<end_line>
..'cause I'm the truth<end_line>
Yah, now what are you? Ha ha!<end_line>
