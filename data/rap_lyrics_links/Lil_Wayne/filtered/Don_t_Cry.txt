Why I'm staring into the clouds<end_line>
Am I rising or they comin down?<end_line>
I see death around the corner<end_line>
And the U-turn sign's lookin like a smile<end_line>
What do I do now? Who gon' find me, how?<end_line>
Nowhere to turn but around and 'round<end_line>
Just another nigga that done lost his head<end_line>
No, a fuckin king that forgot his crown<end_line>
I am not number one, it's true<end_line>
I'm number 9-27-82<end_line>
Color-blind even if I may be blue<end_line>
A lot on my plate, ain't my favorite food<end_line>
But I'm hungry, so hungry<end_line>
Need my family tree next to a money tree<end_line>
with a bunch of leaves in the Garden of Eden<end_line>
With a bunch of Eves, no fruit punch for me<end_line>
I sip from the Fountain of Youth<end_line>
So if I die young, blame the juice<end_line>
Bury me in New Orleans<end_line>
Tombstone reads: "Don't cry, stay tuned"<end_line>
Bring me back to life<end_line>
Gotta lose a life just to have a life<end_line>
But if heaven's as good as advertised<end_line>
I want a triple extension on my motherfuckin afterlife<end_line>
Rest in paradise<end_line>

<verse_start>
Talent is God-given, be grateful<end_line>
Fame is not a given, be humble<end_line>
And conceit is self-driven, drive carefully<end_line>
Stay in your own lane, seat buckled<end_line>
And sometimes when there is, no music<end_line>
We toot our own horns, rum-bum-bum-bum<end_line>
That woman carried, the future<end_line>
And Tunechi was born like, "Dun-dun-dun-dun-dunnnnn"<end_line>
Don't call it a comeback<end_line>
It was dark, now the sun back<end_line>
Hit me hard, but I punched back<end_line>
The wheels fell off, I rode the hubcap<end_line>
Is it suicide or it's do or die?<end_line>
It's newer days and it's bluer skies<end_line>
I told myself, "It's just you and I"<end_line>
Then the breeze came and it blew my mind<end_line>
Lord knows who I'm there for<end_line>
I give my last breath of air for<end_line>
Momma tell me to be careful<end_line>
Voice in my head give me an earful<end_line>
But I got mind control over my control<end_line>
I lost control but knew I'd find control<end_line>
I let God control what I cannot control<end_line>
Can't control the tears, let 'em drop and roll<end_line>
<verse_end>
