I had 20s on my Benz, lent it to all my friends<end_line>
And everything was all gravy, everything was all gravy<end_line>
And if I need somethin' call Baby, I need somethin' call Baby<end_line>
And the streets was callin' me but a nigga had call waitin'<end_line>
And yeah we all went through our phases, we all went through our savings<end_line>
Some niggas stayed on point, some niggas was point shavin'<end_line>
And sometimes we had to be vegetables, that mean we had to stay patient<end_line>
Cause they say you are what you eat, I took the star out of starvation, bitch<end_line>
I come from a Third World, start rappin' in the fourth grade<end_line>
Start trappin' in the sixth grade, went platinum in the tenth grade<end_line>
Dropped out a nigga gettin' paid, this when Birdman had a fade<end_line>
This when Hummers didn't come stretched, but Birdman had 'em made<end_line>
This when pretty bitches set you up and niggas didn't give two fucks<end_line>
You had two guns and two phones, you could waste time and get and get a new cup<end_line>
But this when niggas had pimp cups and new rappers got hem'd up<end_line>

Yeah, yeah.. uhh<end_line>
But this when niggas had pimp cups and dirty money got rinsed up<end_line>
And the early birds in the wormhole would get so fat that they'd get stuck<end_line>
We'd clean our fingerprints up, we'd clean the shit we didn't touch<end_line>
This when niggas called Diddy Puff; lettin' Biggie bump<end_line>
while I'm sittin' up in that big body, I can show you a dead body<end_line>
Lotta niggas got pinched and the snitches ended up dead lobsters<end_line>
Wrap the birds in red tape, call them bitches +Red Robins+<end_line>
Pops had kilos, I needed one key I would've made cops<end_line>
Free my niggas down and rest in peace to all my dead partners<end_line>
I smoke by the pound in like a week and fuck the Weight Watchers<end_line>
Got my self a brand new triple beam just to weigh options<end_line>
I stumbled upon a gold mine, I thank God that it ain't copper<end_line>
Some niggas were late bloomers, but boy look how they've blossomed<end_line>
Don't know niggas that wear wires but I know niggas that go haywire<end_line>
I know hoes that play possum and will bring us to y'all mailboxes<end_line>
And dead man can't talk and the Feds don't have seances<end_line>
Look, you put a knot on the end of a condom full of drugs and put it in her pussy<end_line>
And get through customs cause last time we just took 'em<end_line>
I rather be blind before I be the nigga that stand around just lookin'<end_line>
And you can beat around the bush and find a nigga laying behind them bushes<end_line>
And I know real niggas gon' fuck with this<end_line>
Like that's that shit I be talkin' 'bout<end_line>
Yeah, I know real niggas gon' fuck with this<end_line>
Like that's that shit I be talkin' 'bout<end_line>
