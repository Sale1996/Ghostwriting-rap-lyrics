I got the right<end_line>
To put up a fight<end_line>
But not quite<end_line>
Cuz you cut up my life<end_line>
But my sight<end_line>
Is better tonight<end_line>
And I might see you in my nightmare<end_line>
Ooooh how'd you'd get there<end_line>
Cuz we were once a fairy tale<end_line>
But this is farewell<end_line>
<verse_end>

Babygirl I'm finished<end_line>
I thought we were committed<end_line>
I thought we were cemented<end_line>
I really thought we meant it<end_line>
But now we just repent it<end_line>
And now we just resent it<end_line>
The clouds is in my vision<end_line>
Look how high that I be getting<end_line>
And it's all because of you<end_line>
Girl we through<end_line>
You think your shit don't stank<end_line>
but you are Mrs. P-U<end_line>
And I don't see you<end_line>
With me no more<end_line>
Now tell everybody THAT YOU KNOW<end_line>
THAT YOU KNOW<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
L-L-L-L-LETTING YOU KNOW<end_line>
Tell everybody that you know<end_line>
That I don't love you no more<end_line>
And that's one thing THAT YOU KNOW<end_line>
THAT YOU KNOW<end_line>
<verse_end>
