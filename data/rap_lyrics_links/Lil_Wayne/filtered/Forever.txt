<verse_start>
Okay, hello its the martian, Space Jam jordans<end_line>
I want this shit forever, wake up and smell the garden<end_line>
Fresher than the harvest, step up to the target<end_line>
If I had one guess then I guess I'm just New Orleans<end_line>
And I will never stop like I'm runnin from the cops<end_line>
Hop up in my car and told my chaffuer "to the top"<end_line>
Life is such a fuckin roller coaster then it drops<end_line>
But what should I scream for? this is my theme park<end_line>
My mind shine even when my thoughts seem dark<end_line>
Pistol on my side, you don't wanna hear that thing talk<end_line>
Let the king talk, check the price and pay attention<end_line>
Lil Wayne, that's what they gotta say or mention<end_line>
I'm like Nevada in the middle of the summer<end_line>
I'm restin in the lead, I need a pillow and a tucker<end_line>
My foots sleepin on the gas<end_line>
No brake pads, no such thing as last, uh<end_line>
