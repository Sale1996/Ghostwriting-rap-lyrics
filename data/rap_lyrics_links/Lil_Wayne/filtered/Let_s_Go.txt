Better pay attention now so you don't forget later<end_line>
I run the damn block, I oversee all of the paper<end_line>
Don't make me take ya, play ya<end_line>
I cock the glock and spray ya<end_line>
Call it a caper, won't be no as-salama-laka<end_line>
And J, he got the gauges, they cocked and ready<end_line>
Make me run up in ya places and pop ya daddy<end_line>
Got them bricks rocked and heavy, let it be known<end_line>
I cook it hard and cut 'em in zones and the money be gone<end_line>
Then I hit a blunt to the dome, and ride when night falls<end_line>
Supply the white raw, if there's a problem, knock ya wife off<end_line>
Lock the spot down<end_line>
Respect it young nigga, I'm creepin' over<end_line>
Now cut it with just a little bakin' soda, breakin' boulders<end_line>
I take it out my holster and bakin' soldiers whenever<end_line>
Nigga it's whatever, tell ya ma to call the reverend<end_line>
You see me on the block with crack, gats, and weed<end_line>
Rats, plats, and ki's, that's practically me<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
See I'm a hustler, cut-throat, put rhymes in mom's muffler<end_line>
You can't even count how many times the 9's bust at ya<end_line>
Some of the, niggas that you run with are, suckas bruh<end_line>
None of ya, won't leave, without some bullets up in ya<end_line>
Niggas can't hold me down, wodie wild<end_line>
Cuz all that they can hear is loud screamin' and explosive sounds<end_line>
They show me how to cook that brown and rock that white<end_line>
No school, put that book back down, pick up that knife<end_line>
See that's the real reason I hate to be on tour<end_line>
I'd rather be back on the block with a bird of that pure<end_line>
Niggas got it all wrong, thinkin' I'm all song<end_line>
But yall gon' twist it and end up all gone<end_line>
Dog-gone cocksuckers, you not thuggers<end_line>
I pop dozens of glocks, cousins, in my struggle<end_line>
So stop frontin', it ain't gon' get ya everywhere<end_line>
I'ma start bustin', and bullets hit ya everywhere<end_line>
<verse_end>
