<verse_start>
You're a roughneck, I'm a cutthroat<end_line>
You're a tough guy, that's enough jokes<end_line>
Then the sun die, the night is young though<end_line>
The diamonds still shine, in the rough hoe<end_line>
What the fuck though? Where the love go?<end_line>
Five four three two, where the ones go?<end_line>
It's a shit show, put you front row<end_line>
Talkin shit bro? Let your tongue show<end_line>
Money over bitches, and above hoes<end_line>
That is still my, favorite love quote<end_line>
Put the gun inside, what the fuck for?<end_line>
I sleep with the gun, and she don't snore<end_line>
What the fuck yo? Where the love go?<end_line>
Trade the ski mask, for the muzzle<end_line>
It's a blood bath, where the suds go?<end_line>
It's a Swizz beat, there the drums go<end_line>
If she's iffy, there the drugs go<end_line>
If she sip lean, double-cup toast<end_line>
I got a duffle, full of hundos<end_line>
There the love go, where's the uproar?<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Get the fuck though, I don't bluff bro<end_line>
I come out the scuffle without a scuff, whoa<end_line>
Puff puff bro, I don't huff though<end_line>
Yellow diamonds up close, catch a sunstroke<end_line>
At your front door, with a gun stored<end_line>
"Knock knock, who's there?" is how it won't go<end_line>
This the jungle, so have the utmost<end_line>
For the nutzos, and we nuts so<end_line>
What the fuck bro? It's where I'm from bro<end_line>
We grow up fast, we roll up slow<end_line>
We throw up gang signs, she throw up dope<end_line>
Dreadlock hang down like you dun know<end_line>
Put the green in the bag like a lawnmower<end_line>
Hair trigger pulled back like a cornrow<end_line>
Extra clip in the stash like a console<end_line>
Listenin to Bono, you listen to Donald<end_line>
What the fuck bro? Where the love go?<end_line>
Swizzy he the chef, I like my lunch gross<end_line>
Just look up bro, there the Scuds go<end_line>
I see the shovel, but where did bruh go?<end_line>
Hmm, to the unknown<end_line>
Only way he comin back is through his unborns<end_line>
If you see what's in my bag think I'm a drug lord<end_line>
It's empty when I give it back, now where's the uproar?<end_line>
<verse_end>
