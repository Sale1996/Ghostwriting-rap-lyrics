If you want to leave be my guest, you can step<end_line>
Feeling irreplaceable listening to Beyonce<end_line>
But ok ill put you out on your BDay<end_line>
Now if you rocking with Weezy<end_line>
Bedroom in the bank, baby we safe<end_line>
I got game like E.A.<end_line>
But I want to let you play<end_line>
And don't I treat you like souffl√©<end_line>
Don't I look at you like I see a new day<end_line>
And don't I do what I do say<end_line>
I'm through talking so I'm a let you, Face<end_line>
<verse_end>

Yeah let me catch my breath<end_line>
You talking bout leave baby you ain't gone yet<end_line>
And if you leave, leave correct<end_line>
And I'm a send a jet to pick up the next<end_line>
And if you leave, you're leaving the best<end_line>
So you would have to settle for less<end_line>
I am no Elliot Ness, I don't handcuff I don't arrest<end_line>
I do confess to the virginsy<end_line>
Cause under them sheets I am a mess<end_line>
Yes, baby you blessed<end_line>
Not chess don't jump your nest<end_line>
<verse_end>

About you, your love, your sex<end_line>
You know I work you out like bowflex<end_line>
Our jokes, no stress<end_line>
Love live life proceed progress<end_line>
Make sure the neighbors get no rest<end_line>
We can get together, never disconnect<end_line>
Your back, your neck<end_line>
Funny how that song hasn't got old yet - to us<end_line>
So let's project<end_line>
You stay in, never incorrect<end_line>
<verse_end>
