E-Class, I think we got a problem<end_line>
Big money in this bitch, if you didn't knew<end_line>
Big business, minus the business suit<end_line>
Even I look in the mirror like, "Is it you?"<end_line>
And I say, "I must be the hottest, if it isn't you!"<end_line>
Stay fresh from my top to my tennis shoes<end_line>
New coupe, no top, big tennis shoes<end_line>
Never slipping, even on the side of a swimming pool<end_line>
We don't get ridiculed, we get rid of fools!<end_line>
They said I couldn't play football, I was too small<end_line>
They said I couldn't play basketball, I wasn't tall<end_line>
They said I couldn't play baseball at all<end_line>
And now everyday of my life, I ball<end_line>
And they say you ain't great, 'til someone assassinate<end_line>
And I feel like MLK<end_line>
Yeah, +I Have A Dream+ to be your worst nightmare<end_line>
And now meet The Boss of The Cartel - ROSS!<end_line>

Yeah, you gotta pay for this<end_line>
I remember when I used to pray for this<end_line>
This, this is classic<end_line>
Some shit you might not see again<end_line>
And we taxin', you don't want it - nigga, leave it then!<end_line>
And we taxin', you don't want it - nigga, leave it then!<end_line>
And we ain't trying to see the pen<end_line>
Like a needle in a hay tack, we ain't trying to see the pin / pen<end_line>
This is a luxury tax!<end_line>
