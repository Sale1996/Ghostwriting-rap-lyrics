Money don't make itself, these niggas gon' make me kill 'em<end_line>
I should probably see a shrink but I'm afraid he'll make me little<end_line>

Chop yo, fuckin', head, off, and put it on the front of my car like the emblem - get 'em<end_line>
I got Mike Banger on the beat, I got this banger on display<end_line>
I just test drove a new Lamborghini and got a A<end_line>
Got a billion bitches, I'm lookin' for the one that got away<end_line>
And since all these niggas watchin', ask them for the time of day<end_line>

Can't kill me, I was born dead, crown of thorns head<end_line>
Devil horns red, have my barn head<end_line>
I'm a serial killer, yo lucky charm dead<end_line>
And that trash bag, they find you arm, leg, leg, leg, arm, head<end_line>
Oh what a tangled web we weave, I feel like daddy long legs<end_line>
Hop out that Ferrari Spider for my boys at Rikers and all my lifers<end_line>
My bitch say my dick is great but I make her say it like Tony the Tiger<end_line>
I own a rifle and I'm on the edge, I bop bop and I'm ridin off<end_line>
