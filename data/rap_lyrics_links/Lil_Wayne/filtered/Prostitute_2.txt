Um, I wouldn't care if you was a prostitute<end_line>
and hit every man that you ever knew<end_line>
See it, wouldn't make a difference if that was way before me and you, girl<end_line>
And you won't never have to worry about me, as long as you keep it real<end_line>
Whatever's on your mind, speak don't hide your feelings<end_line>
Stay true for me and never lie to me<end_line>
and don't you ever keep no secrets, no matter..<end_line>

But I don't care, I wanna know you for my damn self<end_line>
Yeah, and even those thugs that say you scandalous<end_line>
Swinging on the pole from one man to the next<end_line>
I don't care what he say, no I don't care what he say<end_line>
Because, they can say what they want baby<end_line>
But the will never change my views<end_line>
Cause they would never know you the way that I know you<end_line>
And I'm trying to share to rest of my whole life with you<end_line>
And if it gotta be a down, so be it baby<end_line>
And if your friends can't understand<end_line>
