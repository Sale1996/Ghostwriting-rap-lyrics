A young nigga screamin fuck the world and let 'em die<end_line>
Behind tints, tryna' duck the world and smokin rie<end_line>
Got my bandanna 'round my head and pants to my feet<end_line>
And got my eyes fire red and glock on my seat<end_line>
I'm tryna' stay under intoxication<end_line>
'Cause I lost my father, and got an order, plus I'm on probation<end_line>
I'm drinkin liquor like it's water, gettin pissy drunk<end_line>
And stayin away from them lil' broads that tryin to give me some<end_line>
I keep a chopper in the trunk and my heat on my wasteline<end_line>
Duckin the law, 'cause I ain't tryna' do no FED time<end_line>
Sometimes I just wish I could be away<end_line>
But I gotta take care of Janae and keep Macita straight<end_line>
So I just maintain the struggle and I keep tryin<end_line>
But how can I when my closest people keep dyin'<end_line>
I ain't lyin that the law tryna' bust my clique<end_line>
But I scream fuck the world man, I'm too young for this<end_line>

Give me a cigarette, my nerves bad<end_line>
The FEDs said they heard that I know where them birds at<end_line>
And my old lady say she saw me with anotha ????<end_line>
And some a the boys shot up my block so now I gotta kill 'em<end_line>
And teachers keep tellin' my momma that I'm gettin' worse<end_line>
And now she trippin talkin 'bout I need to be in church<end_line>
And my lil' girl whole family tryna' lie in court<end_line>
Tryna' put me, a child, on child support<end_line>
And whole family deny me of what I do 'cause I'm a 'thug and stuff'<end_line>
Plus, my niggas keep fallin to them drugs and stuff<end_line>
That dope got these niggas meltin away<end_line>
Man they got clowns right around me, killin they self everyday<end_line>
We keep fightin but they so strong<end_line>
I know it's hard but don't give up baby hold on<end_line>
Just keep ya fate, count blessings, and wodie keep ya trust<end_line>
And grab ya nuts and let 'em know that we don't give a fuck<end_line>
We don't give a fuck<end_line>
<verse_end>

I mean the world just ain't gon' never change<end_line>
So I just keep my head up and my nuts, let 'em hang<end_line>
Dawg I swear it's very rough out here for the youngstas<end_line>
Like everybody against me 'cause I'm a young thug<end_line>
Dear Rabbit, why they have to kill Rabbit?<end_line>
But I'ma keep you alive, nigga, I'm Lil' Rabbit<end_line>
That's why this lil' nigga be buggin like it's no tomorrow<end_line>
I only can depend on macita and C-M-R<end_line>
I try my best to make it through the night and live today<end_line>
But I'm upset so I'm steady wipin' tears away<end_line>
And police got me under surveilance when and wherever<end_line>
Wreckin they brains, tryna' figure where I'm gettin that cheddar<end_line>

But I try to forget about it and just stand strong<end_line>
But if everythang was cool I wouldn't write this damn song<end_line>
Fuck the world<end_line>
