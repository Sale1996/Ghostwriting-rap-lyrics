<verse_start>
And tonight's the night<end_line>
And them girls all on me like white on rice<end_line>
And I get 'em to the crib, play two-on-one<end_line>
I'm, already high, now is you on one?<end_line>
Take a jet to the sunset, you wan' come?<end_line>
Or, sit in my Phantom and chew on gum?<end_line>
Baby, I could take you to and from<end_line>
Ice up ya lil wrist, til' ya blue hand numb<end_line>
Umm, ya dealin' wit' a boss lil mama<end_line>
Young Wayne, tell me my time bud<end_line>
If you hangin' with the homies, I'll holla<end_line>
And if ya man ain't me, why bother?<end_line>
I go by the name Carter<end_line>
I got more plaques than tarter<end_line>
I'm just checkin' out the charts on the charter<end_line>
Number one spot, Wayne and Paula<end_line>

<verse_start>
Don't be so, damn easy<end_line>
Don't be so, d-d-d-damn easy<end_line>
