<verse_start>
Times is torn as it is<end_line>
That's why I got guns, and my guns got kids<end_line>
That's why I be goin' so tough on them hoes<end_line>
I play my own hand, I don't shuffle or fold<end_line>
Fuck wit a nigga, let go fuck wit some hoes<end_line>
Hear them bitches screamin' like they stuck in a hole<end_line>
I am not a deamon, but was once a lost soul<end_line>
'Til I found myself a block away from the cross road<end_line>
I have, outgrown the fishbowl<end_line>
And I'm on my feet like a fuckin insole<end_line>
Yeah it may hurt like a fuckin' left no<end_line>
But it's "fuck the world", like a fuckin nympho<end_line>
And we spend dough, cause we make more<end_line>
And I make sure, when I say so<end_line>
It's Jay Rock and Weezy, need I say more<end_line>
Clothesline the beat, Ted DiBiase flow<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Kingpin hoe, need I say more<end_line>
Your family could die, when I say go<end_line>
Green light green light, whatcha green like?<end_line>
Before ya sign me up, get the scene right<end_line>
And I just happen to fan it when I'm being nice<end_line>
Cause drivin' slow in the Lam', it doesn't seem right<end_line>
Yeah, and I remember them long nights<end_line>
Livin' the wrong life, but I made that wrong right<end_line>
<verse_end>
