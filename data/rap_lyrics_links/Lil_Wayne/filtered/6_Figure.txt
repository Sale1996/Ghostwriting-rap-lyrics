I be catchin' a nigga corner, rippin' through a nigga street<end_line>
Hot Boys they ride with me, like a preist, five deep<end_line>
Windows tinted, clips extened, drum lettin'<end_line>
Bustin' lead 'n, real 'n, Hot Boy$ don't forget it<end_line>
Leave every porch wet 'n, brains all over the step 'n<end_line>
Disrespectin' the whole neighborhood block wettin'<end_line>
Step in, the section, uh-of the Hot Boy$<end_line>
Full of the 'dro, and ride and chop you whole spot boy<end_line>
Better watch boy, where you be at cause I'm a hit at, three flat<end_line>
You want beef, I'ma beef at, make it hot, I'ma crease that<end_line>
Camoflauge to the 'Boks, pop off clips in the glocks<end_line>
Make sure all choppers cocked, start a quake, shake the whole block<end_line>
Take the tip of the jo, kick down the front door<end_line>
Run from front to back bustin', Terius cut his wife throat<end_line>
I'ma play it how it go, hold a black connect sho'<end_line>
We went to school for this, we spend bins like a pro<end_line>
Go chill with the Joe, Say wodie let's get loaded<end_line>
Blow a pound with my round, 50 shot'll get me toted<end_line>
