Bandana 'round my brain<end_line>
Eyes bloodshot red<end_line>
Briches down to my legs, guns up in my trench<end_line>
When niggaz playin, they get drenched<end_line>
My pockets is full of lead<end_line>
So, nigga, stay off the benz, I'm young with bad nerves<end_line>
Since I lost my father, I've been troubled hurt and disturbed<end_line>

Tell that slut go get your stash, and empty your pockets, fool!"<end_line>
That's how it was...  crime, struggle, drivin' for scrubs<end_line>
Lots of thugs... make niggas come ta answer them up<end_line>
