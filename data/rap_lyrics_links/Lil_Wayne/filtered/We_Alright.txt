Do this shit for rizzeal<end_line>
Young Money, Rich Gang, ya heard me, with big ears<end_line>
You just a crocodile, I drink a full cup of his tears<end_line>
Canât recognize you nigga, like Santa cut off his beard<end_line>
And Tunechi, he gonâ be alright as long as he got his pills<end_line>
Iâm higher than my bitch bills; stop cryin bout' 'em, bitch chill<end_line>
I'm working on that "Carter 5", I got this bitch in fifth gear<end_line>
I can't stand these niggas, I'mma lie down or sit still<end_line>
Get tied down with that fuckin' steel at your eyebrow or your fuckin' grill<end_line>
Catch you while you layed up, straight up - bunny ears<end_line>
I shoot your fucking fade up, ratchets don't touch me<end_line>
If that pussy smell like catfish, salmon, trout or guppies<end_line>
I ain't trippin on no ho, treat that ho like a servant<end_line>
I know that ho better know, how to deep throat like a serpent<end_line>
But lose lips sink ships, but I just let these hoes Worship<end_line>
She think I'm a window of opportunity, close curtains<end_line>
