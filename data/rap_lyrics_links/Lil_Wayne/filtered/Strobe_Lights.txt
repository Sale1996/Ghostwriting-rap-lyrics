Love is the party, my heart is such a disco ball<end_line>
She's in line waitin - my guest list too long<end_line>
I told her I would love her, love her as forever<end_line>
Forever's just a word, I put words together<end_line>
Steppin on the stars, she pause<end_line>
And I know that one day this show will end - applause<end_line>
The strobe lights are dancin, we've taken all the chances<end_line>
She question what we are, and I'll drink to the answer<end_line>
Cause my heart is out of service, my eyes turn black<end_line>
I don't see love anymore I'm blind to the fact<end_line>
I got my +World+ in my pocket, cause I ain't tryin to +Drop+ it<end_line>
The sky is at my neck, so I turn up my collar<end_line>
My world spin around her, cause it's a whirl without her<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
HAH! Love create wars, I got wounds and scrs<end_line>
The strobe lights are dancin, dancin with the stars<end_line>
But what happened to ours? What happened because<end_line>
the rain is comin down, now we trapped in the storm<end_line>
And I step right out of her spotlight, and into the strobe lights<end_line>
HAH! ... I don't need your light<end_line>
<verse_end>
