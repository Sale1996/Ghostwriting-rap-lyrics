<verse_start>
I am sittin on the clouds-I got smoke comin from my seat<end_line>
I can play basketball with the moon, I got the whole world at my feet<end_line>
playin touch football, on marijuana street<end_line>
or in a marijuana field-you are so beneath my cleats<end_line>
Get high, so high that I feel like lying<end_line>
down in a cigar-roll me up and smoke me'causeHaha<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Swimmin laps around a bottle of Louie The Thirteenth<end_line>
Jumpin off of a mountain, into a sea of Codeine<end_line>
I'm at the top of the top-but still I climb<end_line>
and if I should ever fall, the ground will then turn to wine<end_line>
Pop, Pop I feel like flying-then I feel like frying<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I can mingle with the stars, and throw a party on Mars<end_line>
I am a prisoner locked up behind Xanex Bars<end_line>
I have just boarded a plane without a pilot<end_line>
and violets are blue-roses are red<end_line>
daisies are yellow, the flowers are dead<end_line>
wish I could give you this feeling-I feel like buying<end_line>
and if my dealer don't have no more, then<end_line>
<verse_end>
