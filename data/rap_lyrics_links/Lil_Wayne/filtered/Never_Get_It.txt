<verse_start>
Hat to the front<end_line>
Lookin' like I'm lightin' up a bat for a blunt<end_line>
I'm stickin' to the script, tryna kick it like a punt<end_line>
My life is like a movie and I do my own stunts<end_line>
I'm the Birdman Jr., call me young Baby<end_line>
Coulda been a killer but Cash Money saved me<end_line>
Remember I was little but the cash money made me<end_line>
Big dog bitch, no tramp, no lady<end_line>
Young ass nigga had a thing for old ladies<end_line>
But as I got older I began to like 'em younger<end_line>
To heavens where I brung her, and when she was under<end_line>
She said "Daddy they, daddy they, daddy they, daddy they<end_line>
Daddy they can't do it like you can"<end_line>
I get chips like Vegas and I am not a blue man<end_line>
Too much ice on my wrist and now I got a blue hand<end_line>
And if I sing Prostitute she gon' need some new pants<end_line>
And if I sing Pussy Monster she gon' need a new man<end_line>
Hello world, I would you all to meet me, her new man<end_line>
I vow to stay on top of my Somers like Suzanne<end_line>
And I hustle everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday<end_line>
Everyday I'm hustlin', fillin' up my cup again<end_line>
With that purple stuff again, I can't get enough of it<end_line>
Pay me in the direction of a swisher and I'm stuffin' it<end_line>
With that purple stuff again, I'm on some same color shit<end_line>
After you do Wayne, it's time to do Wayne's brothers bitch<end_line>
I get money like a fuckin' Wayans brother bitch<end_line>
I get good with Gorillas and stay away from the rattlesnakes<end_line>
And the jakes, and the fake, and the hate<end_line>
Interstate 10, no cops in sight<end_line>
And I'm coming back with a whole flock tonight<end_line>
Lord, don't let me get stopped tonight<end_line>
Or I'ma have to shoot it out with the cops tonight<end_line>
I swear, and tell the jack boys not tonight<end_line>
Cause I ain't 'N Sync but I will Pop tonight<end_line>
Yeah, that's right, if you ain't got that price<end_line>
Then go that-a-way, not a way we can even negotiate<end_line>
Big money heavyweight, on my way to Heaven's Gate<end_line>
So if that be them open gates, flow so appropriate<end_line>
Don't associate me with the bullshit<end_line>
One wish, I wish a motherfucker would trip<end_line>
Like a engine, I come from under the hood bitch<end_line>
But now a nigga gettin' paper like a booklet<end_line>
They ain't help me with it, but I took it<end_line>
And now they never get it, never get it, never get it, never get it<end_line>
Never get it back, yeah that's my word<end_line>
"Bling-Bling" in the dictionary, yeah that's my word<end_line>
And for me Ja Rule made it just like Irv<end_line>
Sometimes I still go through the hood just to kiss my curb<end_line>
Cause I love that block nigga, Eagle and Apple<end_line>
Old G's, young G's, leaders and barrels<end_line>
But God found me like a needle in a barrel<end_line>
And I'm so ready for war cause I'm a Jesus for the battle<end_line>
Money on my mind, that's all I think of<end_line>
Married to the game, never taking my ring off<end_line>
M.O.B., yeah that's my theme song<end_line>
Smokin' two L's, rockin' bells like ding-dong<end_line>
haha, yeah I got my wings on<end_line>
Flyer than the rest, I don't rest I keep going<end_line>
I just I-G-nore 'em<end_line>
Like anyway, anyway, anyway, anyway<end_line>
Anyway it goes, I'ma get gold<end_line>
And I could see the top the way I'm climbing this pole<end_line>
A nigga with the flu ain't rhyming this cold<end_line>
And nigga I'm hotter than a "fire in the hole"<end_line>
Steppin' out my shower like a lion in a robe<end_line>
Eyin' these hoes, iron in my hol-ster<end_line>
Surp, purp, sure<end_line>
Let's elevate and get away, accelerate and never hate<end_line>
Dedicate this, to the blue eyes and blonde hair<end_line>
I'm on top of my green like a lawn chair<end_line>
Don't worry, I'm straight like arm hair<end_line>
Don't worry, I'm straight like combed hair<end_line>
This world fucked my Pops and I was born here<end_line>
From the cell to a jet, call it Con-Air<end_line>
I told my niggas that we would see<end_line>
Better days yesterday, and today is a better day<end_line>
