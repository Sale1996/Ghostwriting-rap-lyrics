Money over the best pussy<end_line>
The blind hear me, the deaf lookin'<end_line>
When opportunity knock<end_line>
I run out the back door shit I thought it was the cops<end_line>
Damn, I fuck the bitch with a broom stick<end_line>
The same broom I didn't clean my room with<end_line>
Stay on my toes, no ballet<end_line>
Shout out my Zoe's, sak pase<end_line>
I'm twisted weed in my mansion, I go dumb in alumni Stanford<end_line>
Remember when moms couldn't afford Pampers, now she trying to avoid cameras<end_line>
All I do is count my blessings, Weezy F. for Fortunate<end_line>
I came up from that bottom, now I'm richer than chocolate<end_line>
