Wezzy fuckin baby, Get 'em a leash<end_line>
Young money Dipset you betta believe<end_line>
That gun got me walking like I got irregular knees<end_line>
I be all over the bread like sesomi seeds<end_line>
Auto-matic with the money like Reggi for 3<end_line>
Big birds no Sesame Street, Bitch!<end_line>
I'm to clean they ain't messin with me<end_line>
I'm just trying to see my decimals speak<end_line>
Now these niggaz just lighter then some good shit to me<end_line>
These niggaz sweet like a taheshin treat<end_line>
They say I'm full of hot air then I release the heat<end_line>
Split a nigga from his teeth to feet<end_line>
Know what I'm talkin about<end_line>
Yadadamean like Keak Da Sneak<end_line>
