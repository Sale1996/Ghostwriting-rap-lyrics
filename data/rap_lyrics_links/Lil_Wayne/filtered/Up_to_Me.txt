Look, where I go from here?<end_line>
Just lost my father last year<end_line>
But I still, remain to keep it real like dollar bills<end_line>
I drop tears, can't believe my daddy's gone<end_line>
Rabbit come home, why ya left us all alone?<end_line>
But I'm comin man<end_line>
Just wait at the gates, I'ma be runnin man<end_line>
Arms open, eyes wide, full a love<end_line>
You watched me come up from a scrub<end_line>
Now ya see ya son ridin everyday on doves<end_line>
But I wish, I could share them times wit' you<end_line>

And it ain't all that cool livin off pictures<end_line>
Ah man, visit while I'm sleep, write a note or call me<end_line>
Can't believe you left me to be a small man<end_line>
But I know it wasn't meant to be<end_line>
That's why I suck up all the game that you sent to me<end_line>
<verse_end>

But it's all gravy I'm with Baby makin millions now<end_line>
So I still smile<end_line>

Ain't nothin changed, if I still come home late at night she fuss<end_line>
But it's still the ol' same ol', same ol'<end_line>
Thangs go, up and down like rainbows, we maintain though<end_line>
So you know who payin the bills now, ah hah<end_line>
Still flossin, give my audience the chills, ah hah<end_line>

I know ya see me everytime, watchin yo' lil boy shine<end_line>
And I know that ya see I put out my own CD<end_line>
And picture this, your little boy even on TV<end_line>
But I swear it's off the heezy, Weezy<end_line>
Say it's cool, you can believe me, I like how they treat me<end_line>
I'm doin' what ya say, don't let a nigga try me<end_line>
And I don't let a fine, pretty broad get by me<end_line>
Don't let nothin' pull me off track from my hobby<end_line>
Oh yeah, and I don't leave my room sloppy<end_line>
But the same thang make ya laugh, make ya cry<end_line>
And everybody that ya love it's like they have to die<end_line>
I pray to the Lord everyday and ask him why<end_line>
And ask him to bless your soul everytime I pass by<end_line>
I know he doin' it, and leavin all the love to me<end_line>
And I'ma prove it, and show ya daddy it's up to me<end_line>
