Stay strong, be tough, that's what the preacher tell ya<end_line>
He never really felt ya, so he can't even help ya<end_line>
Need a shoulder to lean on, somebody to cry to<end_line>
It's like everything's gone, but I'm a survivor<end_line>
Standin on stage in front of thousands<end_line>
Don't amount to me not havin my father<end_line>
That's real talk, I know a lot of y'all got 'em<end_line>
But you need 'em way more when you gotta go without 'em<end_line>
And I'm without 'em, but that's life y'all<end_line>
Sometimes you gotta learn to swim with no lifeguard<end_line>
I'm alright God, shit I'm still breathin<end_line>
But lose hurt like bullets, I'm about to start bleedin<end_line>
Throw me down some comfort, cause my heart need it<end_line>
Tryin to cope wit my chances and meet 'em<end_line>
There's a dark road ahead, but I'm tryin to take it easy<end_line>
Rest in peace Lil Beezy, my nigga<end_line>

Smoke cush all day and pop painkillers<end_line>
Fuck who don't understand it, this what the game did us<end_line>
This what the streets showed us<end_line>
This how the block made us, the same block where they layed 'em<end_line>
I pray every time I cross the spot on the pavement, save me<end_line>
Lord will I be next for the taking?  Take me<end_line>
I know I'm livin like I know when I'm comin<end_line>
But I'm just livin cause I know that it's comin<end_line>
And the end is comin, but I ain't runnin<end_line>
I and hidin and duckin, I'm in the middle of a war, I'm alive and love it<end_line>
I'm just speakin from the heart of the diein public<end_line>
We still beatin, we gon rise above it<end_line>
Though it seem like they cheatin and we loosin<end_line>
We survive if nothin, they could never take the stride from strugglin<end_line>
I gotta ride<end_line>
And sometimes that ride get bloody<end_line>
But I just think about my buddy and go after that money, but uhh..<end_line>

And all the things I never said, I gotta say it now<end_line>
I shoulda said it then, now I gotta talk to clouds<end_line>
Now I gotta walk around, brim down<end_line>
Just tryin to find my way to the next day, escape<end_line>
Ya birthday could be ya death date<end_line>
So I'm livin like it was just yesterday, let's pray<end_line>
Ten fingers together, can't bring 'em together<end_line>
It's murda murda, I don't think it get better<end_line>
So be a competitor or get out the weather<end_line>
Me? I got a umbrella and a berretta<end_line>
I'm just tryin to make sure my daughter future progressin<end_line>
