Mad trees and bitches in dungarees<end_line>
The city under seas, kitchen 100 degrees<end_line>
I love that summer breeze, I'll stand in it until it freeze<end_line>

Nigga, one of my sniplets'll end your whole life<end_line>
You ain't nothing but a riblet to a nigga with a knife<end_line>
In a fork, I'm a pig myself, I eat schwork<end_line>
So be smart and play your own part<end_line>
If you don't love yourself, I'll make you see your own heart<end_line>
And we don't like the narcs, stay away from the cell<end_line>
Hey, I'ma shoot it out if I'm facing the ail<end_line>
Yea, so tell your girl to come and make me rich<end_line>
Weezy Baby nigga, 9 to 5, 10 to 6<end_line>
