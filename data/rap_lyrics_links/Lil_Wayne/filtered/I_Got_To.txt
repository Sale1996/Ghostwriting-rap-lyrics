Bitch look up in the sky it's the bird fucking man<end_line>
Junior daddy  shitting on the game<end_line>
You probably see me sitting on the Range<end_line>
I'm hustling  look up in the sky it's a bird of some cain<end_line>
Aye, I flip it twice and I serve in the game<end_line>
Shout it Ride fly, 20 birds on that thang<end_line>
I say shout it Ride high dro burn my brain<end_line>
Gotta let a boy  I re-earn my thang<end_line>
And my five pound germ might sing<end_line>
A song - if you wanna sing say Bling<end_line>
And if you ever see my pa say King<end_line>
And if you ever see his son say Weezy baby!<end_line>
New prints of the Big Easy baby<end_line>
Ya'll niggas can't see me, but I see you lil Pha Pha baby<end_line>
Ya dude can't lose  I'ma spread my wings and fly away brrrr!<end_line>
