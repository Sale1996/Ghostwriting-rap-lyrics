It's the way you flip your hair<end_line>
And those stylish clothes you wear<end_line>
When you walk into the room<end_line>
All my partners stopped and stared at you<end_line>
But they just been the usual<end_line>
It's the tattoo on your back<end_line>
And that brand new Louie bag<end_line>
With them matchin' high heels<end_line>
I can't help this girls swag's the truth <end_line>
And I just want to give her love, oh <end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Just to smell your perfume, got me goin out my head <end_line>
See you comin' see you goin'<end_line>
Never met someone as bad as you<end_line>
Since you're my favorite girl, yeah<end_line>
I know just what you need, to make you look complete<end_line>
This platinum wedding ring, 'cause oh I got a thing for you<end_line>
I'm a take you around the world, oh baby<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Ah ha ha, yeah<end_line>
OK I'm thinkin' of a master plan<end_line>
Nah, I'm lyin', shorty on my mind<end_line>
Shorty like a fryin', pan, and I ain't got<end_line>
Nothin' but sweat inside my hands<end_line>
So I dig into my pocket, all my money is spent<end_line>
But I don't need a cent, 'cause shorty priceless<end_line>
I tell it like this, I been<end_line>
So baby I can take you<end_line>
I roll up, this is a hold up<end_line>
It's young money man, shorty made me smile<end_line>
When ain't a damn thing funny<end_line>
Heh heh, but still don't nothin' move but the money<end_line>
So baby if I move then we move with the money<end_line>
Which is my favorite dish<end_line>
But if I taste you that'll probably switch<end_line>
And then we will probably switch<end_line>
Now I'm walking up the street, whistling this<end_line>
