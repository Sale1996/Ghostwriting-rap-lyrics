<verse_start>
They call me Birdman Junior, I'm flyer than the rest<end_line>
I'm trying to get a couple cool pigeons to the nest<end_line>
And if you look at how the jewels glisten on my chest<end_line>
Then you will be impressed and yes that's VS<end_line>
Fly boy to death, I used to only fly<end_line>
First class on every plane til I bought a jet<end_line>
I'm on the runway, let down the steps<end_line>
Open the phantom door and light up the cess<end_line>
I smoke the best, Chamillion come get me<end_line>
From University of Houston after I pass my test<end_line>
Swisha lays for sure, it'll come your nerves<end_line>
So boy I'm so high, I could palm the world<end_line>
Yeah and I'm strapped for the turbulence<end_line>
Pow! Now you up here with me in a cloud<end_line>
They call me Weezy Baby, the son of a stunner<end_line>
Bitch I'm flyer than a motherfucker, ya know<end_line>
