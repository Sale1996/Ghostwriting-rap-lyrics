Baby, tonights the night<end_line>
And them girls all on me like white on rice<end_line>
And I get 'em to the crib, play to on 1<end_line>
I'm already hot, now its you on one<end_line>
Take a jet in to the sunset, you wan come?<end_line>
Or sit in my Phantom and chew on gum<end_line>
Baby, I can take you to and from<end_line>
Ice up ya little wrist 'til ya blue hand numb<end_line>
Um, you dealin wit a boss lil' mama<end_line>
Young Wayne, Tony Montana<end_line>
And for you I'll tell my homies "I'll holla!"<end_line>
And if ya man ain't me why bother?<end_line>
I go by the name Carter<end_line>
I got more plaques than tartar<end_line>
I'm just checking out the charts on the charter<end_line>
Number one spot, Wayne and Paula<end_line>
