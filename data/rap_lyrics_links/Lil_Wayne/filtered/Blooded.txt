Once again it's on, yea I'm back in the booth<end_line>
Stayin at the top like a tac in the roof<end_line>
Still on these souls, like a mac in a suit<end_line>
Still on my toes, not a crack in my shoe<end_line>
Rappers talkin bout me, but I don't give a who<end_line>
These niggas still lyin, I'm the motherfuckin truth<end_line>
Talk tough, 'till I knock off ya couf<end_line>
And I own my team, I'm like a malu<end_line>
They hatin on me, I'm jus tryna be Weezy<end_line>
Just like Young Jeezy, in the lime Lamborghini<end_line>
Smoked out my mind baby now I'm seeing 3D<end_line>
Dope boy fresh, from my fitted to my DC<end_line>
All red, so these souls know who we be<end_line>
We be's, bloods we B's<end_line>
Pop pop flows, ya'll niggas sweet pea<end_line>
Gettin high on the yacht, call it sea weed<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I advance my flow, and they must like that<end_line>
They like it so much, they say they write that<end_line>
Barkin at the dog, but I dont bite back<end_line>
I aint CPR, I aint bringin they life back<end_line>
Back CPR, bad bitch wanna bite back<end_line>
Skittles on my wrist, yea nigga the bright pack<end_line>
I'ma shine, I live with a life<end_line>
Air force fly, call me a knife jack<end_line>
Brand new coup, same color in the sky<end_line>
The dash say 2, yall know I'm gon' try<end_line>
Cop pull me over, yall know I'm gon' lie<end_line>
They go up in my trunk, yall know I'm gon' fry<end_line>
Them niggas throwin salt, all over my fries<end_line>

Niggas throwin darts, now we hit the bulls eye<end_line>
Young money bitch, New Orleans Eastside<end_line>

<verse_start>
Been around the world, rep the same thang<end_line>
Been around the world, it's the same game<end_line>
B's up b's up, flame game<end_line>
Blat blat blat blat, bang bang<end_line>
I told my homie, Streets you can't sleep on life<end_line>
So he popped an X pill, and didn't sleep all night<end_line>
I aint worried bout you, I'm jus tryna do me<end_line>
Last album did 2, I'm jus tryna do 3<end_line>
I am what every pair of eyes oughta see<end_line>
Bitches wish they can just call it Art of Me<end_line>
My mommy use to tell me get a 95<end_line>
Cash money let it say, nevermind I'm fine<end_line>
