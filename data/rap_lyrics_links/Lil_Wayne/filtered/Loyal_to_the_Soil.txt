I won't let that money define me<end_line>
I let my struggles refine me<end_line>
I know my angels behind me<end_line>
Young, rich, and in the sticks tryna find peace<end_line>
I ain't get high and I ain't sell dope<end_line>
People ask "why?" I did it for my folks<end_line>
Wanna slice the pie then you gotta have hope<end_line>
Take the plan serious or watch it go in smoke<end_line>
Watch it go in smoke, watch it go in smoke<end_line>
Watch it go in smoke, watch it go in smoke<end_line>

Uh, chin to the clouds, all 10 on solid ground<end_line>
Sipping purple Whitney Houston, never touch the Bobby Brown<end_line>
When it comes to the crown, I done dreadlocked it down<end_line>
Rest in peace my daddy Rabbit, he in Heaven hopping 'round<end_line>
I been outchea on the grind, I want mine on time<end_line>
Keep it a hundred, not even 99.9<end_line>

I rep five, invite your girl to my suite at the Loews, she left high<end_line>
Oh my in a double R, I'm re-ready to die<end_line>
My pockets fat as Precious but what's more precious than time<end_line>
Cause life is too short, I got that from Too $hort<end_line>
Couldn't ball, I was too short<end_line>
But rich, like I play two sports<end_line>
Flag red like scarlet<end_line>
Keep my head in my wallet<end_line>
Leave the BS in the toilet<end_line>
Leave the BS on the Charmin<end_line>
With TF on my garments<end_line>
I wear Trukfit like Ralph Lauren<end_line>
And I'm loyal to my soil<end_line>
Straight from hell, I mean New Orleans<end_line>

They said you wanna make it so here's the keys to survival<end_line>
Get you a work ethic, go about it maniacal<end_line>
Carry your family, all the great ones on that Mariah flow<end_line>
Come to the neighborhood, show a kid to throw a spiral<end_line>
All about your time, that's the best thing to give<end_line>
A message from the distance hardly ever stay in ear<end_line>
Gotta keep a presence even with your relatives<end_line>
Cause we all carry gifts like Santa and the deers<end_line>
I come through with no security<end_line>
I grew up in the slums ain't no fear in me<end_line>
Now the lames come and go and no forgetting me<end_line>
They in love with the life and I don't know Billie Jean<end_line>
Look at my demeanor, see loyalty in my background<end_line>
Love me cause I'm solid, not because I became a cash cow<end_line>
Tryna make jobs for younglings, that's on the ave now<end_line>
That's why I can't have a barbecue and don't have a pat down<end_line>

Watch it go in smoke, watch it go in smoke<end_line>
Watch it go in smoke, watch it go in smoke<end_line>
