He was my teacher, so I was like fuck the lesson<end_line>
He was my preacher, so I was like fuck the reverend<end_line>
My mother sita, she said that I was with the devil<end_line>
My mother sita, now say that he was sent from heaven<end_line>
So, I take heed to every single word that he tell me<end_line>
And I remember what my poppa told me<end_line>
Remember what my poppa told me, Young Stunna<end_line>
