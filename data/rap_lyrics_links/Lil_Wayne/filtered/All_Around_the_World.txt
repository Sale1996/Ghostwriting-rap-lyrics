It's the way you flip your hair<end_line>
and those stylish clothes you wear<end_line>
When you walk into the room<end_line>
all my patnas stop and stare at you<end_line>
But they just wanna use you up<end_line>
It's the tattoo on your back <end_line>
and that brand new Louie bag<end_line>
with the matchin hiiiigh heels <end_line>
I can't help this, girl your swag's the truth<end_line>
