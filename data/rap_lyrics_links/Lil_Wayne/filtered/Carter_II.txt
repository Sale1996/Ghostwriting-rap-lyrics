<verse_start>
All I have in this world is a pistol and a promise<end_line>
A fist full of dollars, a list full of problems<end_line>
I'll address them like P.O. Boxes<end_line>
Yeah I'm from New Orleans, the Creole cockpit<end_line>
We so out of it, zero tolerance<end_line>
Gangsta gumbo, I'll serve 'em a pot of it<end_line>
I'm wealthy, still fuckin wit that block shit<end_line>
Wet your ass up, head to feet til your sock a drip<end_line>
Don't strip, you might fall and bust your ass<end_line>
No snakes at the carter, tell the gardener to cut the grass<end_line>
I hear 'em but they talking under mass<end_line>
Stop throwing pebbles at a bulletproof glass<end_line>
That's Cash Money, honey pie<end_line>
We ain't runnin, we don't hide sayin fuck the other side<end_line>
Don't get caught on it, this the dailiest grind<end_line>
I'll put your heart on it and walk on it<end_line>
The chalks only for the art homie<end_line>
How they trace ya after I erase ya<end_line>
Look around, we at war and you still in preparation<end_line>
I'm riding for them reperations, No patience<end_line>
Slow paper is better than no paper<end_line>
Fast money don't last too long, you gotta pace it<end_line>
You gotta know that paper<end_line>
If you got it from a caper, you gotta blow that paper<end_line>
Gotta know that photo fobia, no kodak moments<end_line>
Feds walls with my pictures on 'em<end_line>
Nah, I ain't even in the school yearbook<end_line>
I don't do too much posin, got a cool killer look<end_line>
Career crook, get your career took<end_line>
I'm back like a brizeer hook<end_line>
Bitch cheer, camoflauge gear, the hunter's here<end_line>
Better play it by ear, you ain't nothing but a deer<end_line>
Around here and this here is The Carter<end_line>
Serve it while it's hot out the pot to your mama<end_line>
And Slim tell me ain't nobody hotter<end_line>
But get your boys some different sauce, I want the whole enchilada<end_line>
I got 'em by the collar, watch me drop 'em<end_line>
On the head at the bottom<end_line>
You ain't gotta shoot 'em cause I already shot 'em<end_line>
And I ain't gotta get 'em cause I already got 'em<end_line>
Get 'em<end_line>
