Bentley interior - I lay back on it<end_line>
Every time a nigga see me it's a Kodak moment<end_line>
Now, I ain't the one to brag<end_line>
But I bought myself a Hummer, my brother a Jag<end_line>
I'm takin' all the hoes, and I'm makin' you mad<end_line>
You violate my household, I'm bustin' your ass<end_line>
Is you listenin'?<end_line>
Do you see my ice when it's glistenin'?<end_line>
'Cause if you're with that baller blockin', niggas comin' up missin' then<end_line>
<verse_end>

I need ato get right up in my new Prowler<end_line>
And put her lips tight on this pipe to suck out the problems<end_line>
Need a Rolex with princess cuts all at the bottom<end_line>
Need a kit with twenty-inches on the car that I'm drivin'<end_line>
Went from dimes to quakes, to money like Bill Gates<end_line>
Doin' a-hundred on interstates<end_line>
in Hummers on thirty-eight's<end_line>
See, we are the CMB, my nigga<end_line>
Fresh, Baby, Hot Boys, and Wheezy Whee, my nigga<end_line>

<verse_start>
Bitch, I'ma be stun'n until the day I go<end_line>
Bentley's and Hummers, and drop Di-a-blos<end_line>
Runnin' with niggas that don't love no hoe<end_line>
Platinum grill 'cause, bitch, I'm done with gold<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Now, you know it's Lil' Wheezy off the heezy<end_line>
Believe me - whoa<end_line>
Hot like pepper, slidin' out the Kompressor slow<end_line>
Me and your wife - slut, don't slam my door<end_line>
Cut on the lights - look how the damn watch glow<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Wherever it's poppin' - we stoppin'<end_line>
But if it ain't hot then - we not then<end_line>
Wherever it's twurkin' - we workin'<end_line>
She got to be slurpin' - that's for certain<end_line>
<verse_end>
