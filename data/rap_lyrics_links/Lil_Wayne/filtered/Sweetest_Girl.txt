She used to be the sweetest girl ever<end_line>
Now she like sour ameretta<end_line>
She wears a dress to the T like the letter<end_line>
And if you make it rain she will be under the weather<end_line>
She used to run track back in high school<end_line>
Now she tricks off the track right by school<end_line>
She takes a loss cause she don't wanna see her child lose<end_line>
So respect her, I'll pay up for the time used<end_line>
And then she runs to the pastor<end_line>
And he tells her there will be a new chapter<end_line>
But she feels no different after<end_line>
And then she asks him+<end_line>
