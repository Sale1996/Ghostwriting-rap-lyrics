But a lot aint enough<end_line>
So I got an occupatioin<end_line>
Gotta bring the baking<end_line>
Straight to the kitchen table<end_line>
Homie if ya girl pregnant<end_line>
You should kiss her naval<end_line>
Cuz you probably wont live<end_line>
To see the motherfuckin cradle<end_line>
Ya past left a scar<end_line>
And ya future's lookin fatal<end_line>
Ya can't be sorry<end_line>
Ya gotta be a savior<end_line>
Gotta be the bread winner<end_line>
So go rob the bread maker<end_line>
When they put ya homey to sleep<end_line>
It's gotta be a wake up<end_line>
Ya move in the hood<end_line>
Then ya gotta meet the neighbors<end_line>

And straight dunk like Staudi-<end_line>

My heart is in the dirty<end_line>
But the rest of me clean<end_line>

Like a tambourine bean<end_line>
Jewelry shinin' like flush<end_line>
Maybaline bling<end_line>
Red Giants jersey if ya know wut I mean<end_line>

One circle, three fingers is the theme<end_line>
And young money mother fucka is the team<end_line>
