I went from nothing to everything<end_line>
I went from finer to better things<end_line>
Colombiana and Mary Jane, stuffed the Eddie Bauer with Eddie Cane<end_line>
Straight to the top, fuck the middle man<end_line>
I cut him out, Edward Scissorhands<end_line>
Everytime I pop thousand milligrams, spin to the top like the ceiling fans<end_line>
Bad bitch pretty, she pretty bad<end_line>
She might get a bag that come with a bag<end_line>
Pull out a molly bag, let her dib and dab<end_line>
Let the money talk 'til it jibber jab<end_line>
My plug just hit me with a give and go<end_line>
Now I'm over the stove and I'm whipping ass<end_line>
Tell the boogeyman I'm the bigger man<end_line>
Tell the trigger man, "pull the trigger, man"<end_line>
Pull up on yo ass, two seater<end_line>
Pull off fast like a loose cheetah<end_line>
One diamond ring on two fingers<end_line>
Cheating on these hoes, call me Tune Cheadle<end_line>
Look how they grinnin' and blushin'<end_line>
I got the enemy rushing, get it, the enemy Russian<end_line>
Fuck it, end of discussion<end_line>

The money don't fold, baby mama keep calling my phone<end_line>
She ride it like a Harley, bitches call me gnarly<end_line>
Them diamonds fufu, you ain't tricking nobody<end_line>
I came up from nothing<end_line>
They was hating, I was getting to the money<end_line>
My wrist lookin' sunny<end_line>
Pussy good and she look like Kehlani<end_line>
Stars in the Wraith, automatic face<end_line>
She wanna fuck my chain<end_line>
Pussy poppin', but you bought her a ring<end_line>
Just to come pull up on me<end_line>
You probably flex for a week<end_line>
In Paris, a 50 at least<end_line>
Too many racks up on me<end_line>
