Pain, since I've lost you, I'm lost too<end_line>
Nigga feelin' like he at the bottom like a horse shoe<end_line>
Sorry for the trouble that I put you and your heart through<end_line>
God knows that I'd do anything for a part two, or to<end_line>
be prayin' for the day you come back to me, sayin' that you forgive me<end_line>
Give me another chance, I'm needin' it like a kidney<end_line>
I don't wanna advance, give me back her hands<end_line>
Give me back her touch, I don't ask for much<end_line>
but I fucked up, I know I fucked up, I admit I fucked up<end_line>
but everybody fuck up, now this other nigga lucked up<end_line>
Tellin' me and my clique don't give a fuck<end_line>
Cause um, we from New Orleans, she was from Georgia<end_line>
She was my down chick, I was her soldier<end_line>
I was her gangsta, she was my shoulder<end_line>
You were the pistol to my holster .. BANG!<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
You forgot about the house, you forgot about the ring<end_line>
I remember everything, I just wanna hear you sing<end_line>
I remember the love, right after the fights<end_line>
You can't tell me you don't remember those nights<end_line>
and if I would cry, then you would cry twice<end_line>
To me you are the brightest star under sunlight<end_line>
See take away my title, take away my stripes<end_line>
You give me back my girl and you give me back my life<end_line>
Give me back my girl and you give me back my life<end_line>
See this is just a nightmare, so I blink twice<end_line>
Open up my eyes hopin' she'd be in my sight<end_line>
I remember the time, I wish I could bring it back<end_line>
What she mean to me, is what I mean to rap<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
But I hope you haven't forgot about me up in the livin' room watchin' Sports Center<end_line>
You were cookin' dinner, I was such a sinner, but the Lord is a forgiver<end_line>
You know they say if you pray then you can get your blessings ordered and delivered<end_line>
and your boyfriend is not like me<end_line>
Ma you even went and got a teardrop like me<end_line>
I remember we would sit at home all day<end_line>
You called me "Butta", I called you "Babe"<end_line>
My momma asked about you, my partners did too<end_line>
I know your daughter will be so amazin' like you<end_line>
and I know you probably wish you never met me, and I just wish you never forget me<end_line>
and let me say, please don't worry 'bout the women I have been with<end_line>
No engagement can amount to your friendship<end_line>
and I hope that nigga know he got a queen, and all I can do is dream .. DAMN!<end_line>
