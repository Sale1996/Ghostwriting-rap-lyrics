<verse_start>
I've waited, days after days, I've grown, age after age<end_line>
I've ripped, page after page, now I'm runnin', stage after stage<end_line>
With a story comin' form nothin' to dinner in a house with mad stories<end_line>
Now every night's trill we leave the club with mad stories<end_line>
Now bad bitches love me and good girls go bad for me<end_line>
I'm havin' a good night, drinkin' everything that's bad for me<end_line>
I'm on all of that, all because I can sorta rap<end_line>
I mean kinda sorta I'm all that, I want it all so order that<end_line>
And let's toast...<end_line>
