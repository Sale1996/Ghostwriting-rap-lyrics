Ahh! My name is Weezy F Baby! Oww!<end_line>
I usually don't do this, ha! Ok, I'm lyin'<end_line>
Cuz these diamonds of mine, just sparkle like wine<end_line>
I'm easy to find, In the darker night time<end_line>
I get so much attention from ya' eyes, like signs<end_line>

My necklace is a crime<end_line>
And that bitch fine, what that girl name<end_line>
I call my jeweller over tell her; "Make that girl a chain!"<end_line>
I take that girl to Spain, she can't pronounce a thang'<end_line>

The fetish is Louiane, I'm bombin' like Hussein<end_line>
But I'm that fire, now I swallow my Butane<end_line>
Residin' on a plane, the sky is my domain<end_line>
I'm in and out the country, passports, and sweat-shorts<end_line>
And tanktops, and sweet thoughts, from sun shades, and private airports<end_line>
