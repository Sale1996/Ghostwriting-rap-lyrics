Ok I'm straight edge, no ricochet<end_line>
That pussy boneless, that Chick-Fil-A<end_line>
I fuck with real riders, and they tickets paid<end_line>
Niggas crying wolf, while I wipe them tears away<end_line>
I swear my mama trust my work<end_line>
So I give these hoes that work<end_line>
They say the best things in life are free<end_line>
So thats why it cost for you to get murked<end_line>
Have my pants saggin like fuck it<end_line>
I'm still on my business, spent my birthday in jail<end_line>
I was making bad decisions, saw my enemy at the light<end_line>
I told Marley light the weed<end_line>
Then I lit them niggas up before that motherfucker turn green<end_line>
Your bitch ride my like a go kart<end_line>
I pay that pussy like Mozart<end_line>
I Mozart these hoes hearts and then after that they worseless<end_line>

If niggas think its a game I leave their brains on their jerseys<end_line>
She said she love me, thats the molly talkin<end_line>
Her pussy so wet, it keep sliding off it<end_line>
She got a nigga, but he ain't me bitch<end_line>
I'm the original gangsta, he the remix<end_line>
Girl do you use that same mouth to kiss your mama?<end_line>
I say only God can judge me, fuck your honor<end_line>
Yeah, her birthday suit is her pajamas<end_line>
She said I didn't know your dick was a recliner<end_line>
I punch her man in his eye give him a shiner<end_line>
I blind him<end_line>
Him and whoever co-signed him<end_line>
I get Adam like Yolanda<end_line>
Young Money Cash Money Obama<end_line>
Its fuck the world no condom<end_line>
If he twisted, Ill unwind him<end_line>
And this pistol came with a silence<end_line>
But I swear to God he heard it<end_line>
<verse_end>
