CJ, YEAH, STUNNA!<end_line>
Uhhh, you know you're paid<end_line>
When you got Baby with you<end_line>
It's Young Money, like Ben Frank's baby pictures<end_line>
I'm the lady twista, I kiss her whiskers<end_line>
I been runnin' this shit, blisters<end_line>
Stickin' to the script, movie star money<end_line>
And if you gassed up, I leave the car runnin'<end_line>
I'm a big smoker, I'm a little drinker<end_line>
The peace sign is just a trigger and the middle finger<end_line>
W-what you know 'bout it, man y'all clueless<end_line>
I let two women ride me, that's carpoolers<end_line>
I rock stupid ice, Mr. Water Coolers<end_line>
If y'all in the building, then we are intruders<end_line>
Simmer me down pimpin', let me handle this<end_line>
I know the game, analyst<end_line>
Man I'm the shit, and y'all janitors<end_line>
Blow out the kush and crack a smile for the cameras!<end_line>
