Uhh - my mind's filled with mine fields<end_line>
The ashes fall, the wine spills<end_line>
The world stops, drops, and rolls<end_line>
It's judgment day or a fire drill<end_line>
Yeah! I pour out my heart, have a drink<end_line>
They say the drunk never lie, they ain't never lyin<end_line>
Yeah; my country 'tis of thee<end_line>
Sweet land of kill 'em all and let 'em die<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Damn - military minded, lost and can't find it<end_line>
The stars on the flag are never shinin<end_line>
Uhh - I saw a butterfly in Hell today<end_line>
Will I die or go to jail today?<end_line>
Cause I live by the sword, and die by the sword<end_line>
Heard po-lice was lookin for me, I'ma hide by a broad<end_line>
Shootin stars in my pocket, bitch sit on my rocket<end_line>
I'm wired out the socket, but still shockin<end_line>
Everybody wanna tell me what I need<end_line>
You can play a role in my life but not the lead<end_line>
If there's food for thought, then I'm guilty of greed<end_line>
Momma said take what you want Â– I took heed - yeah<end_line>
My little breed, yeah<end_line>

Back to life, back to reality<end_line>
Been eatin my girl and she's so sweet, got cavities<end_line>
Granted we do it for vanity not humanity<end_line>
But what's appealin to me is under banana trees<end_line>
Lorrrd, I go so hard<end_line>
I tried to pay homage but I was overcharged - ain't that a bitch?<end_line>
I'm just a nut tryin to bust a nut in the nut shell<end_line>
Used to say fuck the police, now I say fuck jail<end_line>
Uhh; same shit, different air freshner<end_line>
I don't +Playboy+, I ain't Hugh Hefner<end_line>
Tryna be a step ahead, but a few feet behind<end_line>
Two fingers to my head, pop! Peace of mind<end_line>
I'll be in the cloud, cloud number 9<end_line>
And I just fucked the clock, and let it cum to time<end_line>
It's a cold world, I put on a mink<end_line>
There's a chain of commands, I'm the missin link<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
And we live by the sword, and die by the sword<end_line>
Heard po-lice was lookin for me, I'ma hide by a broad<end_line>
Shootin stars in my pocket, bitch sit on my rocket<end_line>
I'm wired out the socket, but still shockin<end_line>
Everybody wanna tell me what I need<end_line>
You can play a role in my life but not the lead<end_line>
Uhh - I saw a butterfly in Hell today<end_line>
Will I die or go to jail today?<end_line>
