Rapping is my hobby, my house has a lobby<end_line>
My bitches act snobby, because I feed them thousands<end_line>
I know that didn't rhyme but I'm only being honest<end_line>
You can't pay me in cash now I'm only seeing commas<end_line>
I swear I got on Saks 5th boxers right now<end_line>
I'm trynna milk the game as if the game was a cow<end_line>
I had an Eddie Bauer expedition seven years ago<end_line>
My grandma used to tell me that she swear I been here before<end_line>
I used to wear braids like Jason's lyric, whoa<end_line>
Spent a bundle on the cross because I'm spiritual<end_line>
And I can never pass a physical, I stay high<end_line>
High as the voice of Akon<end_line>
And make mine a straight with no chase<end_line>
Hold the ice, I got enough on anyway<end_line>
And when they see the boy, they hyperventilate<end_line>
I got 'em running after me like I'm about to win a race<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
No, never entertain the suckers with the hating bidness<end_line>
I'm on a yacht playing table tennis<end_line>
Expensive linin, women sinning<end_line>
Adultery - compulsively<end_line>
I'm an arsonist on the beat, blaze fire<end_line>
The door close to the booth, I feel like a caged lion<end_line>
Yeah let me loose, now let me get 'em<end_line>
Cause I ain't going back and fourth like badminton<end_line>
No I will never drop the ball like badminton<end_line>
And I ain't being conceited, I'm just admitting<end_line>
I flow cocky, got hand rhythm<end_line>
I got this bitch on lock like San Quentin<end_line>
I'm tough daddy, what's popping gangster?<end_line>
I'm trynna keep my pockets fat like opera singers<end_line>
So sharp, if you touch me I'll chop your fingers<end_line>
I'm on top of the game like helicopter angles<end_line>
I see you niggas, I hope you having fun<end_line>
I hope you have a gun, this shit is crazy<end_line>
It's little Baby, I'm here to take it<end_line>
And it's looking vacant<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Ok, now I'ma go off on 'em, at first I was going soft on 'em<end_line>
But now it's time to go hard, busting, banging Bogard<end_line>
Take a shit in yo' yard, take a piss on yo' broad<end_line>
Make a list of yo' boys, and go and murder them all, huh<end_line>
Life is short, yeah a midget told me that<end_line>
And I always thought I was fly like I had a pigeon on my back<end_line>
But I got decisions on my back, vision on my back<end_line>
So don't you try to run up on me, I got precision with that gat<end_line>
I don't rat-tat-tat-tat-tat, all I got to do is tat<end_line>
Bet I hit my tar-get, like a fucking dart mat<end_line>
My address is Cloud 9, seek and you shall find<end_line>
Weezy on da grind, I'm bout my Frankenstein<end_line>
You know me, yeah, from my Lincolns to my Franklins<end_line>
See I make that money stretch and connect like an anklet<end_line>
Keep the bitches running in and out my house like a banquet<end_line>
And I don't even speak their language, haha<end_line>
And if the bitch boyfriend get angry<end_line>
Then my niggas turn around and tell his whole click<end_line>
Fuck that nigga! Pussy ass nigga!<end_line>
Fuck that nigga! Yeah!<end_line>
