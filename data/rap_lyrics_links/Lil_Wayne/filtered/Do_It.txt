<verse_start>
I keep wakin' up with these strippers<end_line>
I keep tellin' myself I'm gon' change<end_line>
But they keep sendin' me these naked pictures<end_line>
And I'm about to get 'em all framed<end_line>
Lord, I know she ain't perfect<end_line>
And I know she off the chain<end_line>
But every time she disappear<end_line>
I'm stuck here like David Blaine<end_line>
Hide her tears when I make it rain<end_line>
Dancin' so long but never made enough<end_line>
Fuck with me, she'll never dance again<end_line>
Fuck with me, we're never breakin' up<end_line>
Get your cash, get your bread<end_line>
Shake your ass on your head<end_line>
Remember when you fell off that pole?<end_line>
I signed your cast on your leg<end_line>
But you've got much better since then<end_line>
I guess that pole dancin' class worked<end_line>
I guess that yoga class paid off<end_line>
You got them hoes mad at work<end_line>
And your lil cousin, she don't dance<end_line>
She count your money and hold your purse<end_line>
Say you only dance to my songs<end_line>
That's a gift and a curse<end_line>
<verse_end>
