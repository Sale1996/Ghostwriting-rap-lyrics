When you get to where the fuck I'm at<end_line>
You gotta remind 'em about where you been<end_line>
About all of the money that done came and went<end_line>
About the two cents I ain't never spent<end_line>
When they say you're too famous to pack a gat<end_line>
I gotta remind 'em about where I'm from<end_line>
Not about where I'm going, about where I've gone<end_line>
Stepping on a Swisher roach like a stepping stone<end_line>
Goin' at a nigga throat like a herringbone<end_line>
Boy do I smell beef? Mmmm pheromones<end_line>
Got a fuckin' halo over my devil horns<end_line>
Trap pumpin' all night like Chevron<end_line>
Suck a nigga dick for a iPhone 6<end_line>
Fuck my nigga Terry for a new Blackberry<end_line>
You can get buried for a ounce of Katy Perry<end_line>
I was only five but still remember the drought in '87<end_line>
Lord tell 'em bitches I ain't got no times to play games with 'em<end_line>
I ain't got no time<end_line>
Tell her that I love her and I hate her in the same sentence<end_line>
I'm fuckin' her mind<end_line>
I got, mind control over Deebo<end_line>
Parmesan my panino<end_line>
Promethazine over Pinot<end_line>
And when my bloods start shootin' that's B-roll bitch<end_line>
