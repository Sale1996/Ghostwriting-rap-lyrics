<verse_start>
Ya... dig<end_line>
So I guess it's my turn<end_line>
And I'ma go at niggaz heads like sideburns<end_line>
Big phantom on the road, make a wide turn<end_line>
Big light, green buds, is what I burn<end_line>
Nikki, since I've been rappin, this is what I've learned<end_line>
All these other niggaz pussy, like dry sperm<end_line>
And I knock this shit out like Tom Hearns<end_line>
If it aint about money, me no concern<end_line>
A paper chaser, 'till my thigh burn<end_line>
And never give a bitch, what I've earned<end_line>
Fuck I look like?<end_line>
I'm lookin for a bitch that can fuck right, cook right<end_line>
And if not, then left foot right<end_line>
Foot get the steppin, yea bitch walk like...<end_line>
And my hoes talk like "Hsshswash", and I just say "Right"<end_line>
We don't fuss fight, she is just.. just.. just right<end_line>
