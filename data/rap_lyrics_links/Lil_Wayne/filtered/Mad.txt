Now tell 'em why you mad son<end_line>
Cause doing it all ain't enough<end_line>
Cause everyone all in my cup<end_line>
Cause such and such still owe me bucks<end_line>
So I got the right to get buck<end_line>
But I try not to let it build up<end_line>
I'm too high, too better too much<end_line>
So I let it go, let it go, let it go<end_line>

Yeah, but I, got a lot to be mad about<end_line>
Got a lot to be a man about<end_line>
Got a lot to pop a xan about<end_line>
I used to rock hand-me-downs, and now I rock standing crowds<end_line>
But it's hard when you only<end_line>
Got fans around and no fam around<end_line>
And if they are, then their hands are out<end_line>
And they pointing fingers<end_line>
When I wear this fucking burden on my back like a mother fucking cap and gown<end_line>
Then I walk up in the bank, pants sagging down<end_line>
And I laugh at frowns what they mad about?<end_line>
Cause here come this motherfucker with this mass account<end_line>
That didn't wear cap and gown<end_line>
Are you mad cause the judge ain't give me more time<end_line>
And when I attempted suicide, I didn't die<end_line>
I remember how mad I was on that day<end_line>
Man, you gotta let it go before it get up in the way<end_line>
Let it go, let it go<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Where'd your love go<end_line>
Where'd your love go<end_line>
Where'd your love go<end_line>
Where'd your love go<end_line>
Where'd your love go<end_line>
Where'd your love go baby<end_line>
<verse_end>
