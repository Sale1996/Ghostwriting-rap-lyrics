Uhh, I got shotguns under my staircase, rob yo hoe ass barefaced<end_line>
Been had this bitch on lock, I'm bout to get this bitch a cellmate<end_line>
All my life I been this cold, all my nights I spend with hoes<end_line>
I keep change on me now cause this shit's startin to take a toll<end_line>
I just flew two hoes in, oh how time flies, clip it's wings<end_line>
Make you spit that safe combination out like Listerine<end_line>
And even though I'm not an artist, this is where I draw the line<end_line>
We don't feel none of you niggas, y'all some fuckin porcupines<end_line>
I still got residue all on my dinner plates, real niggas in my inner circle<end_line>
None of my checks come late, I ain't havin' that, I give 'em curfews<end_line>
Dressed up like a old lady, uzi under my church dress<end_line>
Surprise yo ass like a baby, takin' his first steps<end_line>
Iâm too good for just any bad bitch, smoke like I've been kissin' dragons<end_line>
That milk carton show her missin' panties, that pussy felt like a hidden valley<end_line>
Thank God that I'm so gifted, I wouldn't return a single gift<end_line>
But all good things must come to an end like this blunt burnin' my fingertips<end_line>
Lil Tunechi.. this ain't what you want<end_line>
Put that gun to yo hoe head, make her tell me what you don't<end_line>
Got some moon rocks in my pockets, that's a pocket full of stones<end_line>
Fuck with me cause I fucked around and got that shit from Neil Armstrong<end_line>
Neil ArmstrongNeil Armstrong<end_line>
Fuck with me cause I fucked around and got that shit from Neil Armstrong<end_line>
Got some moon rocks in my pockets, that's a pocket full of stones<end_line>
Fuck with me cause I fuck around and got that shit from Neil Armstrong<end_line>
