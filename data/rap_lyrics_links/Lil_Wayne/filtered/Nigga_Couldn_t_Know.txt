<verse_start>
This is where them niggas die fast<end_line>
Sell bricks and buy bags<end_line>
They dodge class to hit the block and go find cash<end_line>
If you try to pass - take my advice: drive fast<end_line>
'Cause, my man, ain't no escapin' when shots blast<end_line>
You wonder why the cops keep circlin'<end_line>
Niggas murderin'<end_line>
I ain't never saw 'em before<end_line>
Tonight we twurkin' 'em<end_line>
Niggas wearin' masks like glasses<end_line>
Niggas got on tank tops and a pair of Reebok classics<end_line>
Pants to my knees 'cause the glock make it slouch<end_line>
I can't talk right now - I got three rocks in my mouth<end_line>
And, wodie, when we enter-- niggas freeze up like it's winter<end_line>
And if a nigga whisper, pistols eat him up for dinner<end_line>
Seventeen representer - you don't like it, do somethin'<end_line>
And I'll bet you'll see a nigga outside 'bout two-somethin'<end_line>
And we like to dress in all black up in my residence<end_line>
Ain't got on no suits 'cause we ain't tryin' to be presidents<end_line>
