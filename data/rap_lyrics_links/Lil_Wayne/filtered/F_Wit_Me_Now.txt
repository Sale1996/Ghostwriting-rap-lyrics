I go by "Wheezy: the Don"<end_line>
Magnificent nigga, lot of ice around my neck, and freezin' the arm<end_line>
And if a nigga decide to test, their chest get completely took off<end_line>
And if you wonder who the fuck<end_line>
we so sip<end_line>
It's like ain't nothin' but we gotta squab<end_line>
On the block everyday sellin' rocks and shit<end_line>
Choppin' bricks - give the damn cops a dick<end_line>
We cop a whip and drop a brick - that's how we do it<end_line>
Weed, liquor, money, and guns how we do it<end_line>
Freak bitch to swallow cum like fluid<end_line>
Who it be? Through his feet, Dubbs<end_line>
Ain't nothin' sweet 'cause I can't keep trust<end_line>
Lil' nigga - worth well over a mill, nigga<end_line>
Real nigga - come around and show up where you live, nigga<end_line>
Pullin' out the K's, nigga -and all<end_line>
Wayne 'bout to damage your home<end_line>
Nigga 'bout to go to see the man in the stars<end_line>
Hoppin' out the van with bandanas and all<end_line>
Cannons went off<end_line>
News cameras takin' pictures of your family when your avenue's gone<end_line>
Damn, it's a shame how the bullets slammed in your brain<end_line>
How the ice slammed the pain, rammin' your dame<end_line>
That's because she ran into the game<end_line>
Nigga, stop playin' with Lil Wayne<end_line>
Come on!<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Iceberg shorty dammit, pants is saggin', forty magnum<end_line>
Comin' out the club on Bacardi's, staggerin'<end_line>
Ten in the Ferrari wagon, braggin'<end_line>
Ohh, what's happenin'?<end_line>
'round the court 'cause some ex just looked at me<end_line>
Runnin' with them cats that be clappin' the plastic<end_line>
Nigga put a cap in your asses<end_line>
Catch me on the av with the crack and a 'matic<end_line>
Hopin' that the law don't pass me - stash it<end_line>
First of the month, just snatched me a package<end_line>
Bag it - 'bout to get this motherfucker crackin'<end_line>
If a nigga think about jackin', please believe<end_line>
I be clip-slappin', click-clackin'<end_line>
Pull the bitch back and run up on his parents<end_line>
Kidnap for his snacks, and then whack him<end_line>
Shit get drastic<end_line>
That's why I try to stay as fars away from beef as I could<end_line>
Grab me a freak to ease on my wood<end_line>
Transport coke from each of my hoods<end_line>
Wheezy Whee - CMB's in my blood<end_line>
In the streets seventeen's where I'm from<end_line>
And I ain't got no feelins for none of these womens<end_line>
Really, though, fetticheese is my love<end_line>
You know the streets made me<end_line>
And I don't give a damn if you hate me<end_line>
Nigga better be S-Q-A-D<end_line>
Until the bigger man do take me<end_line>
Squad shit!<end_line>
You don't want no violence to keep the quiet<end_line>
We call my people wild, and then we beef in quiet<end_line>
or we'll creep in houses, we'll sweep your momma<end_line>
So, please stay out it, or you leave in silence<end_line>
Come on! What!<end_line>

I ain't got no love for ya's<end_line>
Let gunshots smoked ya's<end_line>
Who fuck with us?<end_line>
Weed, liquor done corrupted us<end_line>
Wet a nigga like umbrellas<end_line>
Take the woman out a man; stomach out a man<end_line>
Pump and bust, the guts comin' out a man<end_line>
Runnin' out the Hummer with guns in each palm<end_line>
If the motherfucker sleep, call him come get it<end_line>
Niggas be kiddin' - me awake, deal away<end_line>
gun-spray - bullets damn near took off your son face<end_line>
Oh, shit - niggas on that whole shit<end_line>
Fours spit so quick like that lil' nigga ain't got no sense<end_line>
Slow this shit down - let me get back down to reality:<end_line>
I cause fatalities for any technicality<end_line>
Wipe off your family randomly - ya understand?<end_line>
It ain't no motherfuckin' game, and I ain't fuckin' playin'<end_line>
Come on!<end_line>
