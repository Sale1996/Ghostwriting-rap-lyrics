Cause to her I'm just a rapper and soon she'll have met another<end_line>
So if tonight's an accident tomorrow we'll recover<end_line>
And I know I'm not supposed to judge a book, by its cover<end_line>
I don't want be in the blind, but sometimes I Stevie Wonder<end_line>
about her, and she wit it if I'm wit it and I'm wit it<end_line>

See, I know this ain't your first but it's better than your last<end_line>
