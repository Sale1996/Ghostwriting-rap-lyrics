<verse_start>
Young Money, yeah, uhh<end_line>
Throw dirt on me, and grow a wildflower<end_line>
But it's fuck the world, get a child out her<end_line>
Yeah my life a bitch, but you know nothin 'bout her<end_line>
Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers<end_line>
I'm rollin sweets, I'm smokin sour<end_line>
Married to the game, but she broke her vows<end_line>
That's why my bars, are full of broken bottles<end_line>
And my nightstands, are full of open bibles<end_line>
Uhh, I think about more than I forget<end_line>
But I don't go around fire expectin not to sweat<end_line>
And these niggaz know I'll lay 'em down, make your bed<end_line>
Bitches try to kick me while I'm down, I'll break your leg<end_line>
Money outweighin problems on a triple-beam<end_line>
I'm stickin to the script, you niggaz skippin scenes<end_line>
Uhh, be good or be good at it<end_line>
Fuckin right I got my gun, semi-Cartermatic<end_line>
Yeah, put the dick in they mouth so I guess it's fuck what they say<end_line>
I'm high as a bitch, up up and away, man I'll come down in a couple of days<end_line>
Okay, you want me up in a cage? Then I'll come out in beast mode<end_line>
I got this world stuck in a safe, combination is the G-code<end_line>
It's Weezy motherfucker, blood gang and I'm in bleed mode<end_line>
All about my do' but I don't even check the peep-hole<end_line>
So you could keep knockin, but won't knock me down<end_line>
No love lost, no love found<end_line>
