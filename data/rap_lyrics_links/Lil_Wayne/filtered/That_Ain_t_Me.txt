Cut the music up please<end_line>
Yeah, I should never leave hip-hop<end_line>
Controlled by my two hands, they go tic-toc<end_line>
Around the clock yes it's my time, my throne<end_line>
Bet I know the time of day in any fuckin time zone<end_line>
I'm feeling like I'm on top of the rhinestone<end_line>
Pull in the ladder from heaven about to climb home<end_line>
Mental thoughts are sharper than a pine cone<end_line>
In this world of numbers I keep my nine on<end_line>
And I don't go to church because the line long<end_line>
And the preacher he be gettin his shine on<end_line>
But I know my Lord, I am God's own<end_line>
Back to my hands, tick tick, a time bomb<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Try to stay afloat on my innertube<end_line>
When they turned my city into a swimmin pool<end_line>
Before that, it was a livin cesspool<end_line>
We got get on our shit like nats do<end_line>
Polices be on my tip like hats do<end_line>
But, I just stay strong like blacks do<end_line>
Never +Saved by the Bell+ in a black school<end_line>
And I stay in trouble like +Zack+ do<end_line>
And in this game, nobody's on my plateau<end_line>
Therefore my name remains like a tattoo<end_line>
Yes, I take giant steps in Shaq boots<end_line>
B-I-R-Dman Jun-ior<end_line>
Or Weezy, F, baby, baby<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Yeah, alright, alright<end_line>
Alright alright I'm in their conversations<end_line>
The title's up for grab I'm into confiscation<end_line>
Punched, shot, or stabbed, now you're the doctor's patient<end_line>
Wild like an Arab from the Islamic nation<end_line>
I get money 'round the clock, ain't got no time for hatin<end_line>
And these niggaz ain't shit like they constipated<end_line>
I get the coupe with the kit, watch me lobster red it<end_line>
Drop the top at the light that's when I behead it<end_line>
So far ahead of them, I feel outdated<end_line>
But I feel electric, like I'm Raiden<end_line>
Used to play Mortal Kombat when I was a couch potato<end_line>
And now I'm comin out with faders, no homo<end_line>
