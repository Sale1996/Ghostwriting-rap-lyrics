Hi Â– G-H-two-oh, dial never<end_line>
My level far from the devil, have some manners <end_line>
Say hello, to angels and watch out for Uranus<end_line>
I go nuts like a Danish then vay-nish into thin air <end_line>
and stay in there<end_line>
This is D. Carter, betta bring ya swimwear<end_line>
Heh, but I'm shallow and when ya this high<end_line>
Everybody else balow - oops, I meant below!<end_line>
Mijo, zero degree yo, frio<end_line>
Get into your +soul+ like Neo, whee-oh<end_line>
Oh, I meant oh-whee - or is it ooh-whee?<end_line>
Truly, I don't give a fuck <end_line>
I am on the ceiling stuck, like a fan full of dust<end_line>
Like her hand full of bucks I'm, spendin like crazy<end_line>
I'm in Wayne's World where the women like ladies<end_line>
And you don't need a telescope to see Weezy F. Baby, hah!<end_line>
