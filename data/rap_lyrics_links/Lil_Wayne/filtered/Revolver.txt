<verse_start>
The shooter name is Wayne <end_line>
The victim didn't complain <end_line>
She just screamed 'shoot again' <end_line>
I gave her extra rounds <end_line>
My barrel twist around <end_line>
I am Mr. Shoot 'Em Down <end_line>
I leave hearts on the ground <end_line>
My love is a weapon <end_line>
And yes I use it well <end_line>
Then I let the rose petals <end_line>
Cover up the bullet shell <end_line>
I never shoot and tell <end_line>
I only shoot to kill <end_line>
And that vest ain't gonna help ya <end_line>
Even if it's made of steel <end_line>
<verse_end>
