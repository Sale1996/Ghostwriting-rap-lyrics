Moolah babe...<end_line>
She was a young girl in pursuit of glory and fame<end_line>
She would do anything she could to feel the flame<end_line>
When everybody know your move and the things you pay<end_line>
She finally made all her dreams come true and then she screamed<end_line>
Oh no, this ain't paradise! Oh no, this ain't paradise!<end_line>
Oh no, this ain't paradise!<end_line>
Oh no, this ain't paradise! Oh no, this ain't paradise!<end_line>
You know, this ain't paradise<end_line>

He was a young boy in pursuit of money and fame-ahh<end_line>
And he would do anything he could to kill the painnn-AHH<end_line>
When everybody know your moves, they speak of your name<end_line>
And ohh, all over the late night local news I heard him screammmm<end_line>
Oh no, this ain't paradise! Oh no, this ain't paradise!<end_line>
Oh no, this ain't paradise!<end_line>
Oh no, this ain't paradise! Oh no, this ain't paradise!<end_line>
Oh no, this ain't paradise<end_line>

I say the sun don't shine forever<end_line>
And everything that glitter ain't gold<end_line>
I say love don't love forever<end_line>
And everything that's new gets old<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Sometimes we try to find<end_line>
the road to the riches, need roadside assistance<end_line>
Blisters on my knees, from beggin for forgiveness<end_line>
Ain't no dollars on my trees, but knowledge on my feet<end_line>
Cause I been climbin to the peak, and runnin from the bullshit<end_line>
I'm tired of playin the same song, who told the DJ bring it back?<end_line>
Dead Presidents, bullet in Abraham Lincoln hat<end_line>
Starin at big poster I swear that he be winkin back<end_line>
Cut school, sell crack, sorry I'm just thinkin back<end_line>
Call-call me crazy I been called worse<end_line>
It's like I have it all, but what's it all worth?<end_line>
Ha ha, I'm probably better in my afterlife<end_line>
I should cherish life but, this ain't paradise<end_line>
