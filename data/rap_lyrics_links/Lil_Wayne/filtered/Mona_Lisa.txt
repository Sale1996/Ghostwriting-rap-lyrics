And you, tell her yo' business, she tell me yo' business<end_line>
You tell that bitch what you feelin<end_line>
All of the beans you be spillin<end_line>
To you she lie through her teeth cavities, fillings<end_line>
She know where you hide to tell me where it's hidden<end_line>
She know when you're gone, tell me when to visit<end_line>
We break in your home, and take the specifics<end_line>
And meanwhile the bitch is on vacation with him<end_line>
so she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains<end_line>
We find out addresses, and we don't leave messes<end_line>
You'll only know that it's gone when you're checkin<end_line>
Then your first thought is to start second-guessin<end_line>
She say "What's wrong?" He say "Nothin, keep restin"<end_line>
She say "What's missin?" "How you know somethin missin?"<end_line>
He scratch his head, she say "Get back in bed"<end_line>
Then she gave him some head, boy you can't trust them bitches<end_line>
And then she say ooh<end_line>

Walk up to the door, and right before he knock<end_line>
She open the door naked, she left it unlocked<end_line>
They started French kissin so he didn't see moi<end_line>
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch<end_line>
Music up loud with his head in the clouds<end_line>

Piss a nigga off, put the gun to his frown<end_line>
