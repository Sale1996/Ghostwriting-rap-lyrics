Stop runnin your mouth<end_line>
No shoes, no feet, I'll run in your mouth<end_line>
I'll come to your house, me and my goons<end_line>
Loadin up bangers, ridin under the moon<end_line>
Throwin up fingers sayin "My side rule"<end_line>
If a nigga disagree, ask him "Must I prove?"<end_line>
That Maybach coupe a cock-eyed fool<end_line>
And I'm "in it like Bennet" hoe, aren't I cool<end_line>
But if that thermostat switch and that needle move<end_line>
Then the attitude switch and the heat'll move<end_line>
I got that, Shakita banana, clip for the tool<end_line>

Wit your friends, to carry you alone<end_line>
To a concrete mattress and a fluffy tombstone<end_line>
Fuck discussion, I ain't in to it boy<end_line>
