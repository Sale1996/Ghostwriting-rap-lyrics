STOP! hatin' on a nigga<end_line>
That is a weak emotion<end_line>
The lady of a nigga<end_line>
And you can get tipped<end_line>
Like you waitin on a nigga<end_line>
Put in body bag and a apron on a nigga<end_line>
I give my all behind the mic<end_line>
But you can never see<end_line>
If you sit behind the light<end_line>
You don't have to pick me to win the title fight<end_line>
But I'ma wear that championship belt so tight<end_line>
And if I'm wrong there is no right<end_line>
And if I'm wrong there is sno-white<end_line>
I'm tryin to be polite<end_line>
But you bitches in my hair<end_line>
Like the fucking po-lice<end_line>
My flow is rare<end_line>
These other rappers nice<end_line>
These other rappers bark<end_line>
Some of em even bite<end_line>
But I'm much more bright<end_line>
I give the game sight<end_line>
So before you dim the light<end_line>
You just might might wanna...<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
STOP analyzing, criticizing<end_line>
You should realize what I am<end_line>
And start epitomizing<end_line>
Confident, got the heart of the biggest lion<end_line>
Confident like fuck em all<end_line>
Pull out my dick and ride it<end_line>
My flow sick so sick<end_line>
Its like my shit is dying<end_line>
It rains a lot in my city<end_line>
Cuz my city's cryin<end_line>
Cuz my city's dyin<end_line>
But I emerge from all of that<end_line>
I am a living poi-ne'er<end_line>
ZION, fear god not them<end_line>
Steer my robin coupe thru the streets<end_line>
In the booth and SABOO<end_line>
And then I leave a tub in the booth<end_line>
I leave a bloodbath<end_line>
Sorry there's a tub in the booth<end_line>
Now, WHERE THE DRUGS AT?<end_line>
Like the strings on a shoe, no nigga fuck that!<end_line>
I'm twisted like the strings on a boot<end_line>
WHERE NEW ORLEANS AT?<end_line>
I feel hip hop stole me<end_line>
Like a bus pass<end_line>
So in your possession<end_line>
I must ask...<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Drag my name thru the mud<end_line>
I come out clean<end_line>
Castaway stones<end_line>
I wont even blink<end_line>
A gun is not a math problem<end_line>
I wont even think<end_line>
Just leave you dead<end_line>
Like the mink under my sink<end_line>
Don't believe in me<end_line>
Don't believe me<end_line>
I graduated from hungry<end_line>
And made it to greedy<end_line>
My flow is like pasta<end_line>
Take it and eat it<end_line>
But I'ma need cheese<end_line>
If I'm baking a zede<end_line>
You niggaz want beef?<end_line>
I want a steak and a webe<end_line>
Lost in Amsterdam<end_line>
By Jamaica where we be<end_line>
Hard body nigga takin it easy<end_line>
All about my paper bout my paper like easy<end_line>
Why do rappers? Why do rappers?<end_line>
Lie to fans lot of rappers, lot of rappers<end_line>
Lie like acting<end_line>
