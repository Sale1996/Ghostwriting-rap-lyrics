<verse_start>
And I'm a start<end_line>
Yea, and I don't have to go to Hollywood<end_line>
'Cause Hollywood come through my neighborhood with cameras on<end_line>
I really think they're stealin from us like a sample song<end_line>
I really wish one day we'd take it back like Hammer's home<end_line>
The hurricane come and took my Louisiana home<end_line>
And all I got in return was a darn country song<end_line>
This whole country wrong<end_line>
What would you write if you just put a little ice on<end_line>
And cut your mic on<end_line>
But you don't even write songs<end_line>
But Hollywood make you spit like a python<end_line>
I meant Cobra, I'm so not sober<end_line>
I'm high like a Hollywood coffee or soda<end_line>
You can call me a roller<end_line>
Your grill's glistenin'<end_line>
Spent a hundred thousand on mine to feel different<end_line>
What's the real sense of it?<end_line>
Bling bling, I know<end_line>
And did you know I'm the creator of the term<end_line>
I just straightened the perm<end_line>
Aint let it sit too long, they just makin it burn<end_line>
And make a movie of our lifestyle<end_line>
But they earn like a dead body burned on a mantlepiece<end_line>
That's why I try not to lie on wax like this candle grease<end_line>
And I be's the little nigga<end_line>
Cooler than anti-freeze defrost on your window pane - Lil Wayne<end_line>
But in Hollywood it's Litt-le Wayne<end_line>
Don't make me nut<end_line>
So that's why I got a pre-nup<end_line>
I do<end_line>
<verse_end>
