Tunechi bitch, on my Future shit, I'm too legit, I sleep on a crucifix<end_line>
I wake up cranky and turn into a lunatic then shoot my bitch behind orange juice and grits<end_line>
Uzi clip, I need another uzi clip, I shoot to kill, these pussy niggas shootin' bricks<end_line>
I'm too for real, your head just a souvenir, she wanna get it off her chest but her boobs too big<end_line>
I'm bumpin' "Carter V" on a iPod, my bitch mad as hell cause it ain't out yet<end_line>
She said "Soon as these niggas hear your new shit, they gon' have to give they styles back"<end_line>
I said "You too cray", she said "You too humble"; I said "You too, bae", she said "You too sweet"<end_line>
Then I asked her do, she go both ways? She say "They do say love is a two way street"<end_line>
I said "Ooh, talk dirty, talk dirty, dirty, talk dirty to me"<end_line>
Treat that girl like cuisine, she gon' wanna shoot scenes, put my dick in museum<end_line>
I'm gon' die on my feet, never knees in the dirt, never dirt on my knees, I'm just servin' these fiends<end_line>
Sell birds to the bees, I sell birds to the trees, Tune I heard you don't sleep, I'm allergic to dreams<end_line>
I don't twerk but I tweak for that purple, that pink, yeah you see what I'm sayin' like you heard what you see<end_line>
I'm a verbal disease, I'm allergic to me<end_line>
Been a turd on these streets since my curtains was sheets<end_line>
Chef on these beats, I'm just stirrin' the grease, that bitch you in love with, she workin' for me<end_line>
I personally get you murdered this week like that blunt between my two fingers, I'm at peace<end_line>
Word, I smirk when I squeeze, trigger smart, street smart, I'm a nerd, I'm a geek<end_line>
I'm absurd, I'm unique, did my time in Cash Money, time served and released but this agent ain't free<end_line>
Word, that's the word on these streets but that shit is old news, that shit is so yesterweek<end_line>
I'm just focused, focused on my expertise<end_line>
They like "Tunechi, you good?" I'm like "Bob, yessiree!"<end_line>
Now don't, I mean don't, don't question me, let me breathe<end_line>
Dog... big dog, I cock back and shoot at ya fleas<end_line>
Money long -- tree trunk, now stand under me, catch these leaves<end_line>
I guarantee no guarantees but repeat what you heard, you a dead parakeet<end_line>
It's Tunechi, bitch; your bitch Tunechi bitch, I fuck her on my balcony, we watch the moon eclipse<end_line>
We do unusual shit, she gonna need lube for this cause I'ma stick it in her maximus gluteus<end_line>
We at the top of the world, she like the view and shit, from up here everybody look the puniest<end_line>
The coke got her all exuberant, she doin' lines like a movie script but these are true events<end_line>
Lord! I'll kill a nigga right now, I'll put a nigga lights out<end_line>
Then put his body in a icebox with holes in his body like socks<end_line>
These niggas softer than, these niggas softer than nylon, so keep my name out your mouth, I hope it taste like cayenne<end_line>
Lookin' up at the skyline, I'm thinkin' to my fuckin' self "You only live twice slime"<end_line>
And motherfuck you if you fight crime, I'm from a place with a high crime rate like Iran<end_line>
We put your ass on Nightline, I'm on the grass like a python<end_line>
These niggas lookin' at me, these niggas lookin' at me sideways, that's because they on the sideline but they never try mine<end_line>
Spittin' like I'm sippin' cyanide while my bitch sip a Mai-Tai but she wine fine<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
And I'm so sorry<end_line>
She say "Don't be sorry"... woo!<end_line>
Then she said "Don't apologize for shit<end_line>
Cause you the shit and we know "Tha Carter V" the shit"<end_line>
Woah.. woo!<end_line>
