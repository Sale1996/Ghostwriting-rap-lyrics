Times ain't the same, shit been goin bad<end_line>
Bend a bitch over, pull some money out her ass<end_line>
I'm tired of the game, cuz it ain't what it was<end_line>
The chopper's so close, I can give that bitch a hug<end_line>
and a gangster need love, so I keep a gangster bitch<end_line>
I got that dope dick, there ain't a bitch I can't addict<end_line>
And I'm lookin at the game, I roll my eyes<end_line>
I looked at the clock and the hands were tied because<end_line>
