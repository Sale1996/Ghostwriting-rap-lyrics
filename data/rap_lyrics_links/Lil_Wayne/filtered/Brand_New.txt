<verse_start>
I'm cold like a midnight in Aspin<end_line>
I am a president, and the assassin<end_line>
Cameras on, big lights, action<end_line>
Welcome to the show, I am the main attraction<end_line>
Money in the mattress, money in the attic<end_line>
Money on my mind, money is my habit<end_line>
Stay on the grind, until money's automatic<end_line>
Bitch I love money, I'ma fuckin fanatic<end_line>
Always strapped, gripped type graspin<end_line>
Say what? Who me? Click clack, blast em<end_line>
Chrome 24s tires thin like, napkin<end_line>
Gotta ride big, cause I am like a captain<end_line>
You know I'm a boss, chillin, relaxin<end_line>
Probably in my office, doin my taxes<end_line>
You litte niggas, so not in my bracket<end_line>
And I don't even have time to practice<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Tight, ridiculous price<end_line>
Ya camera has never saw a picture this nice<end_line>
I'm fishin and the bitches will bite<end_line>
It's probably cause my game is fixodent tight<end_line>
Right, I'm fuckin every bad bitch twice<end_line>
And if she doesn't wear panties, then I fuck her on sight<end_line>
I'm nasty like Spice, I know what she likes<end_line>
I could make a black women scream, like she white<end_line>
I can make a white woman scream, like Mike<end_line>
But before she start singin, she gotta check my mic<end_line>
Niggas just hatin, and I done lost sight<end_line>
It's like I don't see 'em, I only see the light<end_line>
Talkin that shit, but you boys just hype<end_line>
I hope you bring a gun to the fight<end_line>
Aight, Louis V. tennis shoes, big brown stripe<end_line>
You think you fresh, shit nigga, I'm ripe<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Brand new coupe, drivin crazy then a mothas<end_line>
Sittin low in the seats, with the burners sittin under<end_line>
Got my tank-top, top down, it probably aint summer<end_line>
But I ride like that, cause I'm hotter then them others<end_line>
Damn, it's no keep up with the brother man<end_line>
I could spekk my name, in burnt rubber<end_line>
I'm gone, leave me alone, while the dog is at supper<end_line>
You could wash my plate, and put it back in the cupboard<end_line>
Uh um, I'm so far ahead of them suckers<end_line>
I'ma hafta start rappin in numbers<end_line>
I promise the flow don't stop, they come rappin like thunder<end_line>
I bet you hide under your covers<end_line>
<verse_end>
