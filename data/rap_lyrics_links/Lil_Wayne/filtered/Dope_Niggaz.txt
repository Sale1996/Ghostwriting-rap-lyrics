Uh, I thank the Lord I'm not a broke nigga, I'm dope nigga<end_line>
Change my name, I ain't like average, Joe nigga<end_line>
Up above with my above average, hoe nigga<end_line>
Tight frame with a tight camel, toe nigga<end_line>
I got killers on the front line, you on the sideline<end_line>
Follow the guidelines or you be in the skyline<end_line>
Killers on the inside, and on your blindside<end_line>
Shoot you right between your motherfuckin eyebrows<end_line>
Ooh kill 'em, it's that "Carter V", let me get 'em<end_line>
I'm feelin like John Gotti, Lennon<end_line>
And you gon' respect my mind and my sign and my emblem<end_line>
You got money on your mind and we aimin at your temple<end_line>
Check me out or just be quiet in the library nigga<end_line>
Or the flowers on your grave gon' be dyin every winter<end_line>
And as long as I'm alive I'm a financial wizard<end_line>
Long as I can make a dollar out a dime and a nickle<end_line>
Thank the Lord I'm not a broke nigga<end_line>

Yeah, I grew up around dope niggaz, and cold killers<end_line>
And most niggaz was both nigga, two-sport niggaz<end_line>
I was no different from those niggaz, but I was chose nigga<end_line>
See those niggaz somewhere with me in these hoes nigga<end_line>
Momma was a go-getter, a coach nigga<end_line>
Taught me everything I know nigga, a soul sister<end_line>
Taught me how to be a goaltender, support system<end_line>
For that bitch who played her role wit'cha, and those children<end_line>
I ain't lyin slime, all my niggaz ballin, it's a fuckin team sport<end_line>
I could change the world, but I done lost the remote<end_line>
All my niggaz ballin, it's how it's supposed to be, hoe<end_line>
I could change the world, I'd rather change to beast mode<end_line>
Coke sniffers, and dope stickers<end_line>
And most niggaz was both nigga, explode nigga<end_line>
Pop a motherfuckin cork nigga, to those niggaz<end_line>
Cause life's too fuckin short nigga, get old nigga<end_line>
I ain't lyin, got a gold mirror just to see my goals clearer<end_line>
Be a role player, role model while you roll with 'em<end_line>
They say you don't need to be with us, stay on the road nigga<end_line>
That way I wouldn't come to the end of the road with 'em<end_line>
Man, all my niggaz targets, that's includin me, hoe<end_line>
I could change the world, I'd rather change the people<end_line>
And definitions cause we're defined by our legal roles<end_line>
All your haters fuelin, my needle broke<end_line>
Lord, I ain't a broke nigga<end_line>
