I met her after the fame<end_line>
And she aint even like me but I got her after the game<end_line>
Mami was a nice piece, young Cali sweet thang<end_line>
Made her into wifey and then reality changed<end_line>
It was going good...I was happy again<end_line>
But then things got rapidly strange<end_line>
And it had to be Wayne<end_line>
She was still a virgin<end_line>
What more could I ask from a dame<end_line>
But I was a bastard...I asked for the pain<end_line>
Now my ass in the rain<end_line>
And she got a new life...the picture flipped<end_line>
And none of it includes Weez and all his bullshit<end_line>
And I remember the Bahamas for the weekend <end_line>
We was freaking in the suite<end_line>
And she looked sweet enough to beat it up<end_line>
Till we began to sleep and I<end_line>
I'm dreaming 'bout the Victoria Secret lingerie<end_line>
Told me keep it..she aint want moms to see it<end_line>
And just think I once saw it on the girl's body<end_line>
Now all I'm seeing is nobody<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
You see I never really ran, but no gentleman<end_line>
All I know is big pimpin' ma'am<end_line>
I'm just tryna be Weezy<end_line>
And the perfect husband just might be too hard to find in me, Weezy<end_line>
Baby girl you gotta work with ya boy<end_line>
'Cuz all of that cursing it be hurting ya boy<end_line>
Look for the better not the worst in ya boy<end_line>
And maybe I can be ya boy...Ya know what I'm sayin'<end_line>
But see this here is not your everyday love tune<end_line>
It's the story of your everyday thug dude<end_line>
And in your mind you prolly thinkin we don't love you<end_line>
But on the real we just not used to what love do<end_line>
And please consider that<end_line>
We were taught to love money, ice, cars, and clothes<end_line>
Love pussy but you dont love them ho's<end_line>
Love ya niggaz love ya children<end_line>
Now if they got a bitch you could love that<end_line>
Holla back<end_line>
<verse_end>
