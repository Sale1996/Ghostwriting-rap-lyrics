So many doubt 'cause I come from the South<end_line>
But when I open up my mouth, all bullets come out<end_line>
Bang! Die bitch nigga die I hope you bleed a lake<end_line>

I'm just tryin' to be the great, tryin' to get a piece of cake<end_line>
Take it offa your plate, eat it right in your face<end_line>

Shoot shoot shoot shoot shooter<end_line>

<verse_start>
And to the radio stations, I'm tired o' being patient<end_line>
Stop bein' rapper racists, region haters<end_line>
Spectators, dictators, behind door dick takers<end_line>
It's outrageous, you don't know how sick you make us<end_line>
I want to throw up like chips in Vegas<end_line>

If we too simple then y'all don't get the basics<end_line>
<verse_end>

Sock soakin' wet I been runnin' y'all<end_line>

Better know me, Lil Wayne just call me lord<end_line>
Hard, take pain like Tylenols, raw<end_line>
Way past par, for, I'm some shit you never saw<end_line>
I take you to the shootout baby win lose or draw<end_line>
And then they ask who when where how<end_line>
And, my reply was simply pow!<end_line>
