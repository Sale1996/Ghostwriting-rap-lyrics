How you do your lips like that<end_line>
         Move your hips like that<end_line>
         Work your ass like that<end_line>
         Why you make noise like that<end_line>
         Move slow like that<end_line>
         Fuck fast like that<end_line>
         Baby, I ain't gon' lie to you<end_line>
         We so sexually compatible<end_line>
         How I thrill myself, like I kill myself<end_line>
         When I feel myself inside of you<end_line>
         You can be my cutty buddy, nibble on my Nutty Buddy<end_line>
         While we do some freaky things with the lights on<end_line>
         Touchin' on you while I'm listenin' to T-Pain<end_line>
         Huggin' on you while I'm listenin' to Mike Jones<end_line>
         Do it soon as we got in the sack<end_line>
         Or I could hit it in the 'Llac<end_line>
         Off a fifth of the yak<end_line>
  It's the middle of the night<end_line>
         Y'all got into a fight<end_line>
         Now you mad with your feelings hurt<end_line>
         Girl, let me Buy U A Drank<end_line>
         Please tell me what you thank<end_line>
         Right before I get up in them skirts<end_line>
  Skeet, skeet<end_line>
  I pull up in a 'Llac truck<end_line>
  Beep, beep<end_line>
  My mean shawty back up<end_line>
  Beep me<end_line>
  If your man act up, he poor time, girl, I'll be the backup<end_line>

See, I can't be her man<end_line>
And she can't be my girl<end_line>
But we do it like it's the end of the world<end_line>
You dig<end_line>
We have relations like I'm kin to the girl<end_line>
I make her holla like when momma brought her into the world<end_line>
Look, I don't let him buy you dinner tonight<end_line>
Then at the end of the night<end_line>
You be my dinner tonight<end_line>
You see, he dark, he always dim in his light<end_line>
And that girl, wanna shine, I bring her into the light<end_line>
I become her Allah<end_line>
And I swear that thang feel like la, la, la<end_line>
And since he feed her lies<end_line>
I be her dessert on the side<end_line>
