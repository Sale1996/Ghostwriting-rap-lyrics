Pain, since I've lost you I'm lost too<end_line>
Nigga feelin like he at the bottom like a horse shoe<end_line>
Sorry for the trouble that I put you and your heart through<end_line>
God knows that I'll do anythin for a part two, art too<end_line>
Be friends with her, then you come back to me sayin that you forgive me<end_line>
Gimme another chance I'm needin it like a kidney<end_line>
I don't wanna advance, give me back her hands<end_line>
Give me back her touch, I don't ask for much<end_line>
But I fucked, I know I fucked up<end_line>
I admit I fucked up, but everybody fuck up<end_line>
Now this another nigga locked up<end_line>
Tell him me and my click don't give a fuck<end_line>
Cause I be from New Orleans, she was from Georgia<end_line>
She was my down chick, I was her soldier<end_line>
I was her gansta, she was my shoulder<end_line>
You were the pistol to my holster, BANG<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
You forgot about the house, you forgot about the ring<end_line>
I remember everythin, I just wanna hear you sing<end_line>
I remember the love right after the fight<end_line>
You can't tell me you don't remember those nights<end_line>
And if I would cry, then you would cry twice<end_line>
To me you are the brightest star and the sunlight<end_line>
See take away my title, take away my stripes<end_line>
You give back my girl then you give me back my life<end_line>
Give back my girl then you give me back my life<end_line>
See this is just a nightmare so I blink twice<end_line>
Open up my eyes hopin she be in my sight<end_line>
I remember the time I wish I could bring it back<end_line>
What she mean to me is what I mean to rap<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
But I hope you haven't forgot about me up in the livin room watchin Sportscenter<end_line>
You were cookin dinner, I was such a sinner<end_line>
But the Lord is a forgiver, you know they say if you pray<end_line>
then you can get your blessings harder than delivered<end_line>
And your boyfriend is not like me<end_line>
Ma you even went and got a tan drop like me<end_line>
I remember we was in that home all day<end_line>
You called me Butter I called you Bay<end_line>
My mama asked about ya, my partners did too<end_line>
I know your daughter will be so amazin like you<end_line>
And I know you probably wish you never met me<end_line>
And I just wish you never forget me<end_line>
And let me say please don't worry about the women I've been with<end_line>
No engagement can amount to your friendship<end_line>
And I hope that nigga know he got a queen<end_line>
And all I can do is dream, DAMN<end_line>
<verse_end>
