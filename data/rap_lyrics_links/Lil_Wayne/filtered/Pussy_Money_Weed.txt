<verse_start>
Oh yes I love her like Egyptian<end_line>
Want a description? Her body's sickening<end_line>
I can be her prescription, I can be her physician<end_line>
Sexual healing, I can be her religion<end_line>
And now she's kneeling, praying to the ceiling<end_line>
I bless her as if she sneezed, must be the weather<end_line>
I dress her, I am her sleeves, I am her feathers<end_line>
She's fly, flyer than you, flyer than me<end_line>
I love her, she loves me too, I love her three -<end_line>
Times, more than her mom, time will tell that I'm the nigga<end_line>
That she should, we should, be wherever she wanna<end_line>
Be on a late night, mid day, AM<end_line>
Just say when, and I know I be with cavemen<end_line>
But never - mind them<end_line>
She's poison and I am Michael Bivins<end_line>
See I know that y'all don't hear me - but she does, we does<end_line>
What grown folk do when they had too much to drink and I think<end_line>
We done had to much too drink and...<end_line>

<verse_start>
Oh yes I love her like I ought to<end_line>
I see you at the alter Mrs. Carter<end_line>
I see you with my daughter, or son - more than one<end_line>
Maybe five like the Jacksons, or John Paxson<end_line>
Just don't let 'em fuck up the mansion, and daddy will be home<end_line>
Later on, smelling like the cologne that I put on<end_line>
This morn, and I hope that you smell like woman soap<end_line>
And shampoo, and lotion, and perfume, and candles<end_line>
And I'ma run through that pussy like a vandal, yes<end_line>
I'm nasty as a Scorpio but I'm a lucky Libra<end_line>
Got her wet like she's sweating out a fever, wow<end_line>
Leave her, to me and she'll be smiling every single time<end_line>
You see her - from e-ar to e-ar<end_line>
I wanna be beside her when she sleep and she lay<end_line>
Or we can stay awake and watch the next day<end_line>
Clothes are overrated, panties are debated<end_line>
Einstein - her head is the greatest<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Oh yes I love her like her dad told her no man would ever love her<end_line>
Oh and I better be the only man sticking it<end_line>
Licking it like an envelope, mailing it, sealing it<end_line>
Read it, I have written down Victoria's secret<end_line>
Don't tell nobody, don't share your body with nobody<end_line>
Not even a finger, I will cut it off and let him keep it<end_line>
Now that's for Weezy, baby and at my station<end_line>
We have sex orientation<end_line>
When I hit it, she squint like them orient Asians<end_line>
I do me, I say hey miss Chung Lee I like to see your booty<end_line>
Roll like sushi, I'm trynna dip my celery up in her blue cheese<end_line>
Ah's, ooh wee's, wa la's, tah da's<end_line>
Mhm's, uh huh's, oh yeah's, never oh no's<end_line>
Until I have to go, and then its - never oh no<end_line>
I tell her don't cry, I be back like the electric bill<end_line>
And when she butt naked she dress to kill<end_line>
