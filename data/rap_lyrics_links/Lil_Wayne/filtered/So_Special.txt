Uhhh! Boy shorts, wife beater<end_line>
Now let me see it, I'm a sightseer<end_line>
She was sleepin on me, but she's a light sleeper<end_line>
I make her cum first, then I follow the leader<end_line>
I talk shit, I hope it matters<end_line>
We climax, without the ladder<end_line>
Can't desert the future, no Nevada<end_line>
Her body is a weapon, rat-a-tat her<end_line>
I spent the night in heaven I slept with an angel<end_line>
And when we finish I swear that pussy said, thank you"<end_line>
I said "You're very welcome," I'm so well mannered<end_line>
And I go down South, Louisiana<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Then we take a shower together and wash each other's back<end_line>
And if she kick it off, I'ma run it back<end_line>
And then she say my name, like I forgot it<end_line>
She crazy about that dick, Lorena Bobbitt<end_line>
Love be the pilot, but it's kamikaze<end_line>
Yeah body language, girl let's talk about it<end_line>
Freedom of speech, Weezy a beast<end_line>
Open her up like a book, read it and weep<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
So special, yeah<end_line>
Thinkin 'bout you girl got my mind on E<end_line>
You know them other niggaz ain't me<end_line>
Girl I got that 12 Play for ya, that 12 Play for ya<end_line>
Just sit on my grill, that's that tailgate for ya<end_line>
I, put it together, common denominator<end_line>
I tear it up like loose leaf paper<end_line>
I got drinks on chill, my bedroom huge<end_line>
I knock her lights out; I blow her fuse<end_line>
See we don't even fuck no mo', we make love<end_line>
And now she's on the tip of my tongue, my taste buds<end_line>
Heh cause she my honey bee, yeah buzz buzz<end_line>
And now I'm itchin and scratchin, that's that love bug<end_line>
<verse_end>
