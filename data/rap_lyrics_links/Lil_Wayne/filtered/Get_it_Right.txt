Listen, listen, listen<end_line>
Zip it!<end_line>
Cock, then act a fool and make 'em dip it<end_line>
Chrome mack diply<end_line>
Automatic spitty<end_line>
I'm a Hot Boy, nigga, follow me<end_line>
Do or die, survive with me<end_line>
Blow a pound of that broccoli<end_line>
Hit a block and then ride with me<end_line>
Cut 'em all, but not your boy, he just had a baby daughter<end_line>
Then, Cita, he never walk again<end_line>
Don't play with them sharks again<end_line>
I make them niggas bleed like that time of tha month<end_line>
See, I told 'em, "Nobody move; nobody head bust."<end_line>
Plus, a hundred rush, turn a boy to dust<end_line>
Nigga, I'm a soldier, trust...I'll blow a hole in your guts<end_line>
And ain't no "if", "and's", or "but's"<end_line>
You could get mad and fuss<end_line>
Watch your lip, man, you'll touch<end_line>
I'll pop a clip in, and bust<end_line>
Look, I'm straight thuggin'<end_line>
Lookin' at niggas' fake muggin'<end_line>
I'm runnin' with niggas that stay sufferin'<end_line>
That ain' nothin'<end_line>
It's Wheezy Wheez<end_line>
I show off behind cheese<end_line>
Get full of trees<end_line>
Here I come, you better leave<end_line>
<verse_end>

Niggas know I could get ugly when it comes to that<end_line>
Oh, for sure, I leave ya bloody if it comes to that<end_line>
I ain't no ho, if in beef I ain't gon' run from that<end_line>
You got coke, keep it on tha low cuz I'll come for that<end_line>
I keep pistols in my possession cuz I stays in shit<end_line>
I was raised watchin' niggas shoot out with K's and shit<end_line>
My momma tried ta keep me inside, but I snuck out tha back<end_line>
Shot hookie from school, hung on V.L. and sold a lil' crack<end_line>
Niggas respect me cuz they know my nuts be hangin'and swingin'<end_line>
If my toes get stepped on, I'm click-clackin' and bangin'<end_line>
I've been out here since I was, like, ten years old<end_line>
Caught my first gun charge in nineteen-nine-four<end_line>
Scuffed my knees up, but the Lord, he pulled me out that<end_line>
I'm ahead now, and ain't no way that I'ma look back<end_line>
Fresh laid tha track down, I picked tha pad up for a minute<end_line>
Put tha gat down<end_line>
But don't think I still won't act, busta<end_line>
