<verse_start>
Girl, you know I did my time<end_line>
All I had was you on my mind<end_line>
Two years is a long time<end_line>
I nearly almost lost my mind<end_line>
Counted every day that went by<end_line>
Couldn't wait to see the look in your eye<end_line>
All I thought about was loving you<end_line>
See a man had to do what a man had to do<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Girl, don't you know that things got hard<end_line>
I could not stand bein' apart<end_line>
Questioned whether your love was true<end_line>
Was somebody else loving you?<end_line>
Now I'm knockin' at your door<end_line>
You tellin' me you don't want me no more<end_line>
What the hell am I to do?<end_line>
See a man had to do what a man had to do<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Girl, can't you see what you're doin' to me?<end_line>
Is this the way you want things to be?<end_line>
Gave you everything that I have<end_line>
You treat me so cold, you treat me so bad<end_line>
Girl, can't you see you're killin' me?<end_line>
Is this the way you want things to be?<end_line>
My mind is so damn confused<end_line>
Tell me what am I to do?<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I was on the grind movin' bricks<end_line>
You was tryin' to bring me back <end_line>
To nickels and dimes, you had to quit<end_line>
I was servin' it<end_line>
Ready to ride or die behind my partner<end_line>
Ready to slang that nine at any time<end_line>
Cuz I'm a rider<end_line>
Nigga know, Lil' Wayne<end_line>
Get down and dirty for this cheddar<end_line>
And for me to let a broad interfere, nigga never<end_line>
I was taught better than that<end_line>
Slim and Baby gave me the ropes<end_line>
And Rabbit taught me the game<end_line>
And if you think I'm gon' let go<end_line>
Then you can catch up with your thang<end_line>
It ain't gon' happen<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Repeat 1 to fade<end_line>
