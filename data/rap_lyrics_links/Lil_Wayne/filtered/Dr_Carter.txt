Wheres my coffee?<end_line>
Good morning Dr. Carter<end_line>
Hey sweetie<end_line>
Looks like it's gonna be a long day<end_line>
Uhhh another one huh? What we got<end_line>
Your first patient <end_line>
Is suffering from a lack of concepts<end_line>
Uh huh<end_line>
His flow is weak<end_line>
Another one<end_line>
And he has no style<end_line>
What you got for him?<end_line>
Tssss okay<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Let me put my gloves on, and my scrubs on<end_line>
Dr. Carter to the rescue<end_line>
Excuse me if I'm late but like a thief it takes<end_line>
Time to be this great uhhh so just wait<end_line>
Your style is a disgrace your rhymes are fifth place<end_line>
And I'm just grace one uno ace<end_line>
And I'm tryna make your heart beat like bass<end_line>
Hmm mm, but you're sweet like cake<end_line>
And I come to fix whatever you shall break<end_line>
Where is your originality you are so fake<end_line>
So picture me like a gallery capture what I say<end_line>
All I need is one mic all I need is one take<end_line>
Like hey! brighter than the sun ray<end_line>
Got a pistol on a playground watch the gunplay<end_line>
Like no kidding no kids in the way<end_line>
But the kids do watch gotta watch what we say<end_line>
Gotta work everyday gotta not be clichéd<end_line>
Gotta stand out like Andre 3K<end_line>
Gotta kick it, kick it like a sensei <end_line>
You gotta have faith you gottta gotta<end_line>
Wait wait I think I, I think I lost him<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Good afternoon Dr. Carter<end_line>
     I don't know about this one<end_line>
     His confidence is down, vocab and metaphors needs work<end_line>
     And he lack respect for the game<end_line>
Uhhhh let me see<end_line>
You think you can save him?<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Okay respect is in the heart so that's where I'ma start<end_line>
And a lot of heart patients don't make it but hey kid<end_line>
Plural, I graduated<end_line>
'Cause you can get through anything if Magic made it<end_line>
And that was called recycling Re: reciting something <end_line>
'Cause you just like it so you say it just like it<end_line>
Some say it's biting but I say it's enlightening<end_line>
Besides Dr. Kanye West is one of the brightest<end_line>
And Dr. Swizz can stitch your track up the tightest<end_line>
And Dr. Jeezy can fix you back up the nicest<end_line>
Arthritis in my hand from writing<end_line>
But I'm a doctor they don't understand my writing<end_line>
So I stopped writing now I'm like lightning<end_line>
And you ain't +Vince Young+ so don't clash with the +Titan+<end_line>
Fast and exciting my passion is frightening<end_line>
Now let me put some more vocab in your I.V.<end_line>
Here take this Vicodin like it and love it<end_line>
And confidence has no budget<end_line>
So pay me no mind<end_line>
I don't walk it like I talk it 'cause I run it<end_line>
I don't do it 'cause I done it<end_line>
And I'm in the emergency on it<end_line>
God dunnit I've lost another one<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Good evening Dr. Carter it's been a long day<end_line>
     But this one looks much better than the others<end_line>
     His respect is back up, concepts sound good<end_line>
     His style is showing strong signs of improvement<end_line>
     All he needs now is his swagger<end_line>
Okay let me take my gloves off then<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Swagger tighter than a yeast infection<end_line>
Fly go hard like geese erection<end_line>
Flashing patrol police detection<end_line>
Eyes stay tight like Chinese connection<end_line>
Eyes stay tight like pussy at night<end_line>
Baby don't get me wrong I can do that pussy right<end_line>
But I'm too wrong to write too fresh to fight<end_line>
Too paid to freestyle too paid to freestyle<end_line>
Had to say it twice swagger so nice<end_line>
And don't ask me shit unless it concern a price<end_line>
And I don't rap fast I rap slow<end_line>
'Cause I mean every letter in the words in the sentence of my quotes<end_line>
Swagger just flows sweeter than honey oats<end_line>
That swagger I got it I wear it like a coat<end_line>
Wait, as I put the light down his throat<end_line>
I can only see flow his blood starting to flow<end_line>
His lungs starting to grow this one's starting to show<end_line>
Strong signs of life where's the stitches here's the knife<end_line>
Smack his face his eyes open I reply What a night<end_line>
Welcome back hip hop I saved your life<end_line>
<verse_end>
