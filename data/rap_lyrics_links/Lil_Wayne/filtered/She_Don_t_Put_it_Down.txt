<verse_start>
I can see the stars in the daytime<end_line>
Bitch I miss you like a deadline<end_line>
And the girl I'm with is just the girl I'm with<end_line>
I mean it's workin out, so we're stayin fit<end_line>
But you know love is nothin, ask Stan Smith<end_line>
But I gotta keep a bad bitch like Brad Pitt<end_line>
Remember our first kiss? Or our last kiss?<end_line>
I used to go dummy in that pussy, crash test<end_line>
You be fuckin that nigga like you was fuckin me?<end_line>
Heh, fuck that nigga, he can't fuck with me<end_line>
I'm Tunechi bitch and you know that, and that pussy throw back<end_line>
At any given night I'll still pop that ass like a Prozac<end_line>
Girl you know you got that murder, a beast in that La Perla<end_line>
And every time we cut I used to +Shredd-er+, Ninja Turtles<end_line>
And I know you still love me, and I know it's still for me<end_line>
That's why we still fuckin - cause she don't put it down like you<end_line>
