I never felt better, Never have, Never will,<end_line>
I mean all I see is money, I got a C-Note between my eyes,<end_line>
Please feel me, Sqad Up nigga,<end_line>
I'ma dig deep folk, Dig deep dogg,<end_line>
Now listen, Now what you is?<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I am what you call a survivor, like trouble with drama<end_line>
But I recover with power, and love it with honor<end_line>
Discovered as a son of a problem<end_line>
Remember smugglin powder throught the doors of my high school<end_line>
To force up they nostril, 'til it got full<end_line>
But now they pop for a pill<end_line>
Lil one here's what's up, Drugs could kill<end_line>
But drugs could heal<end_line>
If ya, ahh, ill for that good feel<end_line>
And it feels good when them fields pull<end_line>
We wheels quarters through the real raw parts of the streets<end_line>
My hearts in the streets, So watch what ya step<end_line>
When ya run from the gunfire of Glocks and Tech's<end_line>
Specials and Pumps, Vests is for chumps<end_line>
Eat ya chests for lunch, munch<end_line>
Young country dude, hunt ya down with tools<end_line>
Repsect my presence, I step with weapons<end_line>
You fall in seconds<end_line>
Its all in the code of the streets, we go by it and stop from it<end_line>
Real nigga talk, No frontin<end_line>

<verse_start>
Chrome's hidden inside of my tires<end_line>
You should see the size of my tires<end_line>
Ridin' on Mark McGwires, I spark the fire<end_line>
Got me higher than a late flight<end_line>
From L.A. to New York twice in the same night<end_line>
Got some shit in my bag to make ya vein white, Cocaine pipe<end_line>
Watch homie's brains get rain whipped<end_line>
Thats the type of sight to make Wayne right<end_line>
They sayin life is short but money is long, And money is life<end_line>
So for now I'm runnin the lights, in the 600 with pipes<end_line>
Hop out, Collar Polo, and under the stripes is something that bites<end_line>
We will be thuggin for life<end_line>
And can't nothin pursuede or change us<end_line>
We gangstas, we live it, I'm in the post without a Pippen<end_line>
But fuck it, I'm just shootin when I can't move<end_line>
Who'da knew I can't lose<end_line>
And truthfully through the loot that's Young Money Entertainment<end_line>
You get it arranged then holla at me<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I burn in the winter, stand up in the fall<end_line>
Stand up in the stands, and stand up for my dogs<end_line>
Them asses I will spall, the plan is too ball<end_line>
But the stuff I got in my pants cuff<end_line>
is enough to make'em put my hands on the wall<end_line>
Work, push on the strip, I'm pushin the whip<end_line>
Fat back pockets, my cushion if I'm lookin to slip<end_line>
I'm hookin ya lip, If ya play hookie with my chips<end_line>
Put that ass kitchen, bitch, when ya cookin that shit<end_line>
Dodge hoes, jukin and shit<end_line>
Cause I can see beautiful women, but I'm not lookin for shit<end_line>
I'm from the hood where you tooken for shit<end_line>
So you gotta take the shit, and make ya shit<end_line>
I had to bring home the bacon bits<end_line>
Cause Pop's was fakin, and he left a nigga bakin shit<end_line>
Now my heart ache and itch, from all the flagrant shit<end_line>
I gotta take in, and thug out<end_line>
Real nigga talk, bitch<end_line>
<verse_end>
