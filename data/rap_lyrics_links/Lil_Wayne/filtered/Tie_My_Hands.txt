Some say tragedy's hard to get over<end_line>
But sometimes that tragedy means it's over<end_line>
Soldier, from the academy league of rollers<end_line>
I deny being down though they seem to hold us<end_line>
My, shoulders are strong I prove 'em wrong<end_line>
I ain't doing nothing but moving on<end_line>
Let the truth be known<end_line>
But they talked that freedom at us<end_line>
And didn't even leave a ladder, damn<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I, knock on the door, hope isn't home<end_line>
Fate's not around the lucks all gone<end_line>
Don't ask me what's wrong ask me what's right<end_line>
And I'ma tell you what's life, and did you know?<end_line>
I lost everything, but I ain't the only the one<end_line>
First came the hurricane, then the morning sun<end_line>
Excuse me if I'm on one<end_line>
And don't trip if I light one, I walk a tight one<end_line>
They try tell me keep my eyes open<end_line>
My whole city underwater, some people still floatin'<end_line>
And they wonder why black people still voting<end_line>
'Cause your president still choking<end_line>
Take away the football team, the basketball team<end_line>
And all we got is me to represent New Orleans, shit<end_line>
No governor, no help from the mayor<end_line>
Just a steady beating heart and a wish and a prayer<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
And if you come from under that water then there's fresh air<end_line>
Just breathe baby God's got a blessing to spare<end_line>
Yes I know the process is so much stress<end_line>
But it's the progress that feels the best<end_line>
'Cause I came from the projects straight to success and you're next<end_line>
So try they can't steal your pride it's inside<end_line>
Then find it and keep on grinding<end_line>
'Cause in every dark cloud there's a silver lining<end_line>
I know...<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Yeah, Born right here in the USA<end_line>
But, due to tragedy looked on by the whole world as a refugee<end_line>
So accept my emotion<end_line>
Do not take it as an offensive gesture<end_line>
It's just the epitome of my soul<end_line>
And I must be me<end_line>
We got spirit y'all, we got spirit<end_line>
We got soul y'all, we got soul<end_line>
They don't want us to see, but we already know<end_line>
<verse_end>
