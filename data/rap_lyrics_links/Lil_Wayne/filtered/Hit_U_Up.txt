Hello, world<end_line>
I zip through fast in a yellow pearl drop Porsche Boxter<end_line>
Young mobster, wild and obnoxious<end_line>
Pop some in your dreadlocks - What? Me not no rookie, boy<end_line>
Glock cookin', boy<end_line>
I'll turn your forehead to a pussy, boy<end_line>
Off the gate, cousin, you niggas gon' make me stalk and spray somethin'<end_line>
Spark or lace somethin'<end_line>
Park the car, get out, walk, and spray somethin'<end_line>
Taught to stay thuggin' brought up in this shit that we call America<end_line>
And in my hood the laws are scared of us - we are too terrible<end_line>
If I live to be old, it's a miracle<end_line>
'cause the way a nigga hatin' or bitch plottin', the shit's hysterical <end_line>
That's why I keep me two big guns on blast like a stereo<end_line>
Come to your burial and kill anybody else who care for you<end_line>
Don't blame me, society changed me<end_line>
You haul white, you smash powder all night for the fast dollar<end_line>
Cut off lights, we masked riders<end_line>
The hood trash got us in a position we can't shake<end_line>
With boys we can't break, and due to that you ain't safe, bitch<end_line>
