Nigga I be hard on a hoe cause a bitch ain't shit<end_line>
And every hoe I done fucked done sucked my dick<end_line>
I had to pour out some drank for niggas I miss<end_line>
I hope my weed ain't too loud to hear the snakes hiss<end_line>
It's "Dedication 5", medication high<end_line>
I got to clean up after these niggas cause they be wastin' time<end_line>
And boy my hoes don't get in line because they stay in line<end_line>
I'm shinin' on these hoes so hard, they gettin' tan lines<end_line>
It's Tunechi, I go hard, I put in work<end_line>
Twin Glocks, the gift and the curse<end_line>
Dirty money, no footprints in dirt<end_line>
We geeked up, +The Revenge of the Nerds+<end_line>
I swear, play with these niggas, that's that shit I don't do<end_line>
As long as money talks, I got someone to talk to<end_line>
Watch my dogs treat the beef like dog food<end_line>
I got the power but a short fuse, let's go<end_line>
I can't trust my iPhone, I think Siri the feds<end_line>
You know snitches get stitches nigga, needle and thread<end_line>
You better walk it like you talk it or we cut off your legs<end_line>
Pretty please don't kill my vibe, I ain't too proud to beg<end_line>
Alright, fuckin' right, shoot you up at the light<end_line>
Straight take all yo possessions, call that shit poltergeist<end_line>
And my homie he a sniper, we call him Wesley Snipes<end_line>
I call my bitch Plain Jane cause she catch nut like a flight<end_line>
I'm on a mission to get movie money, stick to the script<end_line>
Your bitch leakin' information, I just follow the drip<end_line>
Soon as I get that coupe, I'ma go get the rims<end_line>
Toss the keys to my homie, tell that nigga it's his<end_line>
I feel like He-Man when I'm in your hoe<end_line>
You tell that bitch give me my space like a telescope<end_line>
In her throat like Ricola, my system solar<end_line>
I'm too young to die sober, your man a cobra, watch that nigga, let's go<end_line>
Boy, my bitches got bitches badder than your bitches<end_line>
But I can't trust none of them bitches though, like magicians<end_line>
Straight blowin' money fast, I'ma get a ticket<end_line>
Soon as I get off paper I'ma smack a nigga!<end_line>
No broken mirrors, I can't see myself broke<end_line>
Right back pocket flag redder than a velvet rope<end_line>
Never say never, she might do her friend, you never know<end_line>
Shorty make that dick stand up like it's tellin' jokes<end_line>
Uhh, I swear to God, I put in work<end_line>
I'm on them shrooms, my goons on alert<end_line>
I spit these bars, this a universe<end_line>
You better duck, like Dooney and Bourke<end_line>
I'm tellin' you, shoutout Turk, it's Hot Boys, bitch +Tha Block Is Hot+<end_line>
If I ain't have the keys to success, I would have picked the lock<end_line>
Diarrhea shit don't stop until my fuckin' casket drop<end_line>
Still got that crack, maybe one day I'ma pass the rock<end_line>
Tunechi, "Dedication 5", whattup five?<end_line>
