Born in New Orleans, rasied in New Orleans<end_line>
I will forever remain faithful New Orleans<end_line>
I thank you New Orleans, thank you Hollygrove<end_line>
That's been my hood since a snotty nose<end_line>
I come thru the hood suicidal doors<end_line>
I used to come thru the hood on the handlebars<end_line>
Gat in my drawers, money in my pocket<end_line>
Crack in my jaws, I hope it don't disolve<end_line>
And you know I'm ducking 5-0 and my moms<end_line>
Youngin' quick to go off like car alarms<end_line>
Now the youngin' keep his mind on the parmagean<end_line>
Them other niggas ain't eating like a Ramadan<end_line>
Spit the shit that make you feel it in ya chromosomes<end_line>
Got some money, put my whole damn corner on<end_line>
Young Carter part 3, I'm the corner store<end_line>
Eagle Street, keep it going till homies home<end_line>
And I'm just lighting up my..<end_line>

Can I kick my story to ya'll? My glory in God<end_line>
My faith and my flow, I pray that I go where no other rapper has<end_line>
And when ya rapping as, vivid as I<end_line>
Ya limit is the sky, so I<end_line>
Study B.I., I bang Tupac<end_line>
I hum Aaliya, and Soldier Slim was a leader<end_line>
Who am I not to follow greatness?<end_line>
And give these emcees hell like they all athiest<end_line>
Tell them hating niggas one like they in The Matrix<end_line>
And tell the cops I can buy my own bracelets<end_line>
I'mma keep the paper running like a pair of aces<end_line>
Used to sport the Gucci bucks, nigga no laces<end_line>
Stripe polo, five pocket Girbaud<end_line>
Momma got her tube tied, I'm rocking dolo<end_line>
I used to have the Starter jacket with the logo<end_line>
And a hat, myself I had the N.O., that's the Saints nigga<end_line>

It's, Lil Wayne, I'mma shine in the rain<end_line>
Now nothing gets clear without me signing my name<end_line>
I'm just, headlining the game, won't quit until I'm<end_line>
A-roding the game, they riding the bench<end_line>
They not in the game, I misplaced the key to the lock and chain<end_line>
My spot remain, like a bleach stain, or cranberry<end_line>
It's, "Murder She Wrote" like Angela Lansberry<end_line>
I remember being small mayne<end_line>
New toys when my momma win the card game<end_line>
Got my gifts before Christmas, didn't have to wait for em<end_line>
I had a 10-speed, a scooter and a skateboard<end_line>
Haha, then we moved to the suburbs<end_line>
Me and lil Toya Johnson was lovebirds<end_line>
Oh man, and I swear I feel born again<end_line>
I'm in the building like the audience, just lighting up my<end_line>
