<verse_start>
It's weezy baby,<end_line>
Strapped like the navy,<end_line>
Ridin' wit a half a brick strapped to her baby,<end_line>
I be getting money, run a lap if you lazy,<end_line>
Grand daddy purp got me trapped like mazes,<end_line>
Bunch of diamond chains lookin' like a bunch of lasers<end_line>
Understand I'm sharper than a fuckin' hellraiser,<end_line>
Bad yellow bitch on my sidekick pager<end_line>
You know it's goin' down like down goes Frazier, ya dig?<end_line>
Yes, and I be wit mid west chubby<end_line>
But I'm from the dirty, keep it dirty like I'm playin' rugby,<end_line>
Bitch ride me like a old school huffy,<end_line>
Let me see you work your mouth like a fuckin' guppie,<end_line>
My leather softer than brand new pair of hush puppies<end_line>
My top will leave if I decide to hit the punch button,<end_line>
It's young weezy, how could I ever quit stuntin'?<end_line>
Get mad, I'ma get money<end_line>
