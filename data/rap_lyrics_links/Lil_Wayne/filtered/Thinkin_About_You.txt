Woke one mornin'..<end_line>
Woke one mornin'tears in my eyes<end_line>
And you had left me without a kiss or a note or goodbye<end_line>
Now I gotto learn to live alone<end_line>
But my heart can't take it, I guess that's why I wait by the phone<end_line>
For a call, a call from you<end_line>
Sayin' she needs me back, just as much as I, need you<end_line>
But I guess for the time, you need to stay away<end_line>
Let me tell you baby, now I'm thinkin' of you every day<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Oops, up-side your head<end_line>
I said "Oops, upside your head"<end_line>
I said feet, don't fail me now<end_line>
I said feet, don't fail me now<end_line>
White man came down to my city<end_line>
On my corner and asked me what do I do?<end_line>
I said "I do what I wanna"<end_line>
I said "I do what I wanna"<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I keep thinkin' 'bout the good times we had<end_line>
And how we let jealousy turn all we had good into bad<end_line>
Now I realize, if you just try it again<end_line>
Love will play out, you'll be my girl, I'll be your only man<end_line>
<verse_end>
