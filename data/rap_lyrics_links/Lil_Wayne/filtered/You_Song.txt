<verse_start>
Uhh, give you the world if it was for me<end_line>
My diamond grill make it hard to see I'm lyin' through my teeth<end_line>
And now I'm flyin' on my PJ, lookin' at the clouds<end_line>
Thinkin' about yo ass and how it look like a big smile<end_line>
I get mental flashbacks of your ass crack, lemme get back on track<end_line>
You say I act like I don't miss you, that's because I don't act<end_line>
But anyway, we can role play or get straight to it<end_line>
Sorry, my mind in the gutter, better yet sewer<end_line>
And when you say "I love you", I stutter "I-I love you too"<end_line>
It's Wayne's World, she say "What is this world comin' to?"<end_line>
And she know me and whoever together, she hope we comin' loose<end_line>
She told me that if she ain't the one, she gon' throw up the deuce<end_line>
I laughed at her, we took a bath together and splashed each other<end_line>
Then she got serious and said "Tune, I gotta ask you somethin'<end_line>
Do you really love me?" I tried to change the subject<end_line>
So I said some crazy shit to her like..<end_line>
"What if you and I were just letters?<end_line>
That'd be unfortunate we'd have to rob a fortune teller<end_line>
But I swear I think I love you, fingers crossed in my pocket<end_line>
Okay that's a dead subject, you bring it up, that's a zombie<end_line>
You remind me of, my memory ain't what it used to be"<end_line>
She said she ain't trippin', I know because I move my feet<end_line>
And when she figure out that she been swindled<end_line>
I'll be cleanin' that love bird shit off of my window<end_line>
I-I love you too<end_line>
