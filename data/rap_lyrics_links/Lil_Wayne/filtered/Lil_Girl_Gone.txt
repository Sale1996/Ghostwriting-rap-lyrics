Okay, I'm talking 'bout a good girl gone bad<end_line>
Crooked world, wrong pad<end_line>
Right mom, wrong dad<end_line>
I sing this song mad, but not mad enough to shoot you<end_line>
But, it just eats me up like some barbeque from Luther's<end_line>
In the morning with the boosters, on the corner with the boosters<end_line>
And she's the fresh-cut, and they're on her like sutures<end_line>
And I wanna talk to her, but her momma has to school her<end_line>
I wanna see her better, she's the weather of my future<end_line>
I don't wanna see another hurricane<end_line>
Baby, you can kill the pain<end_line>
If you just let me explain<end_line>
Trust me, I know what I'm sayin'<end_line>
You will end up on the track of an oncoming train<end_line>
Stuck in the passenger seat, trying do the fast lane<end_line>
