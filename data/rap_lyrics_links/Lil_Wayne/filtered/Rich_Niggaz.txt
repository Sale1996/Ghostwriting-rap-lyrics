Why, why, why<end_line>
Why, why, why<end_line>
Why, why<end_line>
Cash Money, Rich Niggaz<end_line>

<verse_start>
Loud pipes, big rims<end_line>
Nigga, that's my life<end_line>
When I pull up at the club sorry that's my night<end_line>
I know a lot of haters probably sayin that that's not right<end_line>
Well, my diamonds so much bigger<end_line>
So, that's my life<end_line>
Gleam, gleam<end_line>
Now, only carry big face and you hear the ching, ching<end_line>
Now, you can ask your wife and she will say the same thing<end_line>
And your children be amazed when they see me on the big screen<end_line>
Ha, ha, ha<end_line>
I crack myself up<end_line>
I know I talk lot but I can back myself up<end_line>
Got a little house on the beach that's where I shack myself up<end_line>
You ain't really got more money than me<end_line>
Think about it<end_line>
Let's just say somebody gave me a check to think about it<end_line>
So I just bought a new Rollie and got to take a link up out it<end_line>
And me with no ice is like a Prince concert that ain't crowded<end_line>
They see the Beam, and the truck, and the B-12<end_line>
And we was next<end_line>
Then that's when I pull up in the B-E-L<end_line>
Le-Le-Lex<end_line>
