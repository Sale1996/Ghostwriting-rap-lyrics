I live it up like these are my last days<end_line>
If time is money, I'm an hour past paid<end_line>
Ughh, gunpowder in my hourglass<end_line>
Niggaz faker than some flour in a powder bag<end_line>
Yeah, I put it down like my hands hurtin<end_line>
I'm on a natural high, but I land perfect<end_line>
Some of us are lovers, most of y'all haters<end_line>
But I put up a wall, and they just wallpaper<end_line>
So love or hate me, I stay hate-free<end_line>
They say we learn from mistakes, that's why they mistake me<end_line>
I got some weight on my shoulders, to me it's like feathers<end_line>
All hail Weezy, call it bad weather<end_line>
I stick to the script, I memorize the lines<end_line>
'Cause life is a movie that I've seen too many times<end_line>
You're on the outside lookin in, close the blinds<end_line>
And they say never say never, but fuck it never mind<end_line>
I've been gone too long<end_line>
True or false, right or wrong<end_line>
Hello Weezy, welcome home<end_line>

Life is a choice, and death is a decision<end_line>
Times have changed, but fuck it get a new watch<end_line>
I still got the vision like a line between two dots<end_line>
Young Money's eatin, the label gettin fatter<end_line>
And yeah, the tables turned, but I'm still sittin at 'em<end_line>
I'm a bad motherfucker, cuz the good die young<end_line>
Everybody sellin dreams, I'm too cheap to buy one<end_line>
Man when that cookie crumble, everybody want a crumb<end_line>

Big money, big money, deep pockets<end_line>
Money talks and muh'fuckers eavesdroppin<end_line>

Light that Ashton Kutcher, I'm a limit pusher<end_line>
Y'all dead meat, and me I'm just a butcher<end_line>
I do it for the money, man I am such a hooker<end_line>
And freedom was my girl, until they fuckin took her<end_line>
You can look into the future, it's right behind your eyelids<end_line>
But I don't wanna know, 'cause shit I like surprises<end_line>
