Uh! I clean up well, loafers down to moccasins<end_line>
But back up off me baby girl, I need some oxygen<end_line>
Ieah, I know I know, I'm Mr. Get It Poppinton<end_line>
But every time I see you comin I'm like not again<end_line>
Chill girl, chill girl, I'm done, I ain't got no more to give<end_line>
You can't cross the line, 'cause I let you cross the bridge<end_line>
It's blood banks, it's weed spots<end_line>
You can make me a hundred a hour, suckin cocks<end_line>
I don't care if your mother's sick, her rent's due<end_line>
You got three dollars, good bitch, spend soon<end_line>
I'm a chiropract, I'll break your back<end_line>
Then tell your man he can have you back like<end_line>
