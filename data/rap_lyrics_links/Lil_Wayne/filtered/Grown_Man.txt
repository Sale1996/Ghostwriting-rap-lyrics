Yeah What's happenin baby I'm Lil Wayne from New Orleans<end_line>
Fresh out the Navy now the captain of my own team<end_line>
Hop in this machine, vanish from the scene<end_line>
God damn it I'm so manish, handle it like a standard<end_line>
So put your panties and your pants by the trashcan<end_line>
Grown man on the floor plans, We hold hands while we rollin<end_line>
Just trying to keep up with the program, Just tryin to sneak up on ya<end_line>
Like how you doin, ma'am? I'm an old soul and a young man<end_line>
We got to it and we didn't stop til the birds hit the block<end_line>
And she ain't never had it like that hahaha<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
You ain't no woman<end_line>
You a baby girl living in a ladies world<end_line>
And I'm a grown man, the women understand<end_line>
See what I go through is what I owe you<end_line>
So you should throw that ass back to me right now<end_line>
Yea Fly boy, baby sit back relaxin<end_line>
Cruise with a nigga, destination satisfaction<end_line>
Who says their baby, she say weezy fuckin baby<end_line>
I say yes in fuckin deed, she says don't you ever leave<end_line>
I say, I say but I got money on my mind<end_line>
Then I tell her nevermind and we do it one more time<end_line>
Hehe, For a large amount of time<end_line>
Long, it won't stop til daytime come home<end_line>
<verse_end>
