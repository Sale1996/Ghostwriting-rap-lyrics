<verse_start>
I'm tryin' to do right<end_line>
But I'm surrounded by wrong<end_line>
Avoid the all night flight<end_line>
And still make it on my own<end_line>
I'm tryin' be cool <end_line>
Do what I gotta do<end_line>
But playa haters all over<end_line>
So I roll with my crew<end_line>
I'm tryin' stay over<end_line>
And just stay my ass in school<end_line>
Ain't  many choices to choose<end_line>
And this rap game I can't refuse<end_line>
I wanna win don't want to be the one to loose<end_line>
My pistol my only friend<end_line>
Cause busters try to bring the blues<end_line>
Leavin brains with no clues<end_line>
Spin the ben in black clothes<end_line>
They tryin' ta' take my only life<end_line>
Leave my folks on the front row<end_line>
Bury me in providence<end_line>
Heavy weight that rose<end_line>
They wanna steal the B.G.<end_line>
Now tell me Alton<end_line>
Ain't that cold<end_line>
What can I do <end_line>
Now what can I do to get out the game<end_line>
What can I do <end_line>
Now what can I do to make change<end_line>
Every other day around my way niggas dyin'<end_line>
Hours flyin I want to go straight boy I'm tryin'<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I'm tryin' to get my mail straight<end_line>
Sell cd's and tapes<end_line>
I don't want to be jail bait<end_line>
Niggas want to kill me<end_line>
And increase the hell rate<end_line>
They almost got me<end_line>
But I slip the spot it was too late<end_line>
I wanna be a role model for my lil' brother<end_line>
And buy a fifteen room manison for my mother<end_line>
Settle down wit' a silent hoe <end_line>
And drop a tight seed<end_line>
So I can raise another uptown B.G.<end_line>
Just like me<end_line>
I'ma give 'em but I wish had a dad<end_line>
He goin' be smart and bad nigga<end_line>
Throwin' up a solga rag<end_line>
This world is kurupted<end_line>
The police is crooked<end_line>
My boy was runnin with a ??? gun<end_line>
His young life they took it<end_line>
This ??? is rotten<end_line>
Everyday it get's colder<end_line>
They throwin' away the key<end_line>
Sendin' the soldiers to angoula<end_line>
My round slangin' that yola<end_line>
With they hand on that iron<end_line>
To keep my mind right<end_line>
Beleive nigga I'm tryin'<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I'm tryin' to be a man at fourteen<end_line>
Choppin iron at fourteen'<end_line>
Nigga that tells my only way <end_line>
A lil' bity something<end_line>
Whuckin, representin' partners<end_line>
Ain't to good in my neighborhood<end_line>
Uptowns my partner<end_line>
I ain't lie i'm tryin <end_line>
To go the right way<end_line>
But the night flight way<end_line>
Just ain't the right way<end_line>
I wan' be a gangsta but also wan' live<end_line>
So I choose to be a uptown HotBoy hard to kill<end_line>
Sittin' behind the cruiser wheel <end_line>
Can't even see me I'm so lil'<end_line>
And you expect me to give this<end_line>
Just to switch to positive<end_line>
As hard as I'm tryin' do it I just can't make a shape<end_line>
School I'm tryin' go through it but I just can't make a shape<end_line>
Gettin' in beef that resultin' into serious gun slangin<end_line>
Do good I want yeah but on half i just keep hangin'<end_line>
I'm lookin for a change but change ain't lookin for me<end_line>
Will I remain a B.G. <end_line>
Or a A student<end_line>
We'll see<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
-Chorus- 2x<end_line>
<verse_end>
