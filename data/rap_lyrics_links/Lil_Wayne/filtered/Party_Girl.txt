<verse_start>
My girl like other girls, how awesome is that?<end_line>
I let my homies run a train right off of the track<end_line>
She wasted, swallow, don't waste it<end_line>
She just tell me to come, like invitations<end_line>
Yeah, she on one, she drink, she smoke<end_line>
A jump off, like a sinking boat<end_line>
That I could overboard, I pray she sober, lord<end_line>
But I can't picture that, with a Polaroid<end_line>
And she look at her watch and say "it's party time!"<end_line>
She say "here's to living life on the borderline"<end_line>
I say "you go girl, but stop talking that shit"<end_line>
Cause no matter what you say, you still a Young Money bitch, ah!<end_line>
