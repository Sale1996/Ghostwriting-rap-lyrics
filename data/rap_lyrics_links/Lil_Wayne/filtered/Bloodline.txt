<verse_start>
The streets make the hustlas<end_line>
Hustlas make the world go round<end_line>
The world is made of keys, ounces and pounds<end_line>
The keys, ounces and pounds is made from hustlas<end_line>
See how shit come back round for ya<end_line>
Gotta cop it, chop it and cook it<end_line>
See how shit come back round for ya<end_line>
Gotta kick in the oven now watch it bubble<end_line>
And you can knock on my door<end_line>
But you can't knock the hustle<end_line>
But I- it's like a game of twenty-one and I got nineteen<end_line>
And my Jake but I put more 'd' on me<end_line>
Lil Weezy Wee gon eat that's how it is<end_line>
Got insurance on the floor man I'm that positive<end_line>
And I'm shaggy in the saggy lens<end_line>
Me an my squad in the paddy wagon tally Benz<end_line>
And you know I put the mags on that<end_line>
.45 mack with the flash on that<end_line>
Who want it<end_line>
Everybody sing along<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
And when I move, I move out with the raw<end_line>
I move out with the squad<end_line>
To his album we ride we so mob<end_line>
I throw lives and lowest to live<end_line>
For my loaf of bread the people's player<end_line>
I did what the culture said<end_line>
And I live by the coast of Nostre Cid<end_line>
Fuck around I'll knock your shoulder from your head<end_line>
Get it right I'm a soldier till I'm dead<end_line>
This kid is white with buttonholes inside that bled<end_line>
I'm pumping o's with lots of hay<end_line>
I'm so high and really I don't even know why<end_line>
And oh I just go buy a whole house<end_line>
And lay my mat down lay her back down<end_line>
But I never put my mack down<end_line>
You see the thug in me<end_line>
You know Weezy he the young son of Bubba-B<end_line>
Buy my basketball shorts with a thunder B<end_line>
If you want it then come to me<end_line>
I'm right here<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I'm G'd up<end_line>
Only follow the code of the streets<end_line>
Live bad to die good<end_line>
Know how to move when hustling by the days with no food<end_line>
But just so I can eat<end_line>
And ain't it a bitch<end_line>
And if you see me getting fat I'm probably getting rich<end_line>
And you probably can see me for some crack before six<end_line>
And after that it's all bricks<end_line>
A fake and my palm is wrapped around this eight<end_line>
And my arm because the dirty south is straight Vietnam<end_line>
I skate with the bomb<end_line>
I'm asking you don't play with me at all<end_line>
Shots hit your ass and make three of y'all<end_line>
It'll take three of y'all to fill one of my shoeprints<end_line>
Cuz I did and do shit that's better than new shit<end_line>
Fit for two clips<end_line>
The kid is a nuisance<end_line>
Awww man, he's inspired by his own gangsta music<end_line>
And the Blueprint<end_line>
Cruising through stoop with the ewe lit<end_line>
like ooh shit this is more than weed, it's 500 Degreez<end_line>
<verse_end>
