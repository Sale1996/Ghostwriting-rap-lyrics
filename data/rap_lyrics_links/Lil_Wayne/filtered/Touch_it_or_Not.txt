<verse_start>
I get head in the strangest places<end_line>
two at the same time, call it changin faces<end_line>
I tell a bitch "we ain't tradin places"<end_line>
Now stand back and catch my amazing greatness<end_line>
Taste and savor it<end_line>
Vanilla Ice Cream, she say "ooh, my favorite"<end_line>
Do you know who you playin' wit? <end_line>
Chillin' like a scarecrow, looking for some brain<end_line>
Drivin' in the range or <end_line>
flying on a plane<end_line>
Her head is crazy so she's insane<end_line>
She know the game, get in and get right<end_line>
Every bitch in the industry wanna rock my mic<end_line>
I'm hot like light<end_line>
I'm tough like Ike<end_line>
I don't fuck with dog hoes cause them hoes might bite<end_line>
Yeah, and then she follows<end_line>
In the back of my mind, I'm hopin' she swallows <end_line>
