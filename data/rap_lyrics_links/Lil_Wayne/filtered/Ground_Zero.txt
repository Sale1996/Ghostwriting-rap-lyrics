Back the hell off!<end_line>
Rock and roll Jesus with all my nails on<end_line>
All I need is a blunt and a bail bond<end_line>
And give these blind motherfuckers somethin to feel on<end_line>
Rollin like a motherfucker put your wheels on<end_line>
And let's roll down the hill 'til the hill gone<end_line>
I started on the block but that's somethin to build on<end_line>
And how can I pray when I got nuttin to kneel on?<end_line>

<verse_start>
Huh, walk on the air<end_line>
Show me to the edge and I walk off there<end_line>
We ain't high enough, au contraire<end_line>
And sometimes life just don't compare<end_line>
Sa-say my name, baby pull my hair<end_line>
And I'ma fuck you like a bull, I swear<end_line>
I got a lot of love that I could just share<end_line>
I got a lot of drugs that I could just share!!<end_line>
I-I-I know, I know, what'chu like girl<end_line>
A nice little mirror and a little white girl<end_line>
Way at the top of the mountain, bouncin<end_line>
May I be everything but grounded<end_line>
I don't ever wanna see the bottom, the bottom<end_line>
I just wanna float, float like Muhammad<end_line>
I don't ever wanna see the bottom, the bottom<end_line>
I just wanna float...<end_line>

I know a girl named Crystal, her last name Ball<end_line>
I look into her eyes, and I can see it all<end_line>
I see it when she cry, I'm there when she call<end_line>
Cause I live inside of the mirror on the wall<end_line>
Kill-kill 'em all, die in the spirit of the war<end_line>
Thinkin what am I, be in spiritual fall<end_line>
Huh, shit, cause ain't no love<end_line>
Die while America drink yo' blood<end_line>
It ain't no hurricane, it ain't no flood<end_line>
It's some other shit that we ain't know of<end_line>
Make that money yeah make that money<end_line>
Then watch the government take that money<end_line>
But we gon' raise hell motherfucker get well<end_line>
Laws get passed and economies fail<end_line>
Love, hate, emotion, compulsion<end_line>
Addiction, diction, virgins, dickses<end_line>
Minglin, mixin, swingin, switchin<end_line>
Swaggin, sweet, freaks, faggots<end_line>
Flames, fashion, planes, crashin<end_line>
Ground, zero...<end_line>
