I miss the shit out ya, it's hard to be without ya<end_line>
But I know you watchin, peepin down on how I'm livin<end_line>
Ay, tell Jesus I said thanks for the blessings he sendin<end_line>
Please ask him to forgive me for the sins I commit <end_line>
Just let him know I'm still young and at risk<end_line>
Say, I'll never forget the time that you caught me smokin herb in the house<end_line>
I was dead wrong, I deserved to get out<end_line>
But you just talked it over with my mom and got it situated in due time<end_line>
Told me get the paper instead of high<end_line>
So now I take that advice and shed light over my whole life dog<end_line>
I wanted to be just like you my whole life dog<end_line>

But don't trip, I hold you down, you still remain through me<end_line>
And dog I know I can't see you but I bet that you smilin<end_line>
And I'm a make you even happier, I promise<end_line>

I know you see my daughter growin up and bad as ever<end_line>
But she cool 'cause she do whatever daddy tell her<end_line>
And your wife, she's still the most wonderful woman<end_line>
I just built her a new house, she ain't runnin from nothin<end_line>
B and Slim, them niggas still love me like they own child<end_line>
Ms. Rose nerves get bad, but still she gon' smile<end_line>
And me I'm on some squad shit and some debate it<end_line>
But I know they love it way more than they hate it<end_line>
And I know you probably laughin at the way I treat these hoes and these <end_line>
I try love 'em, my BM be trippin<end_line>
But Rabbit, you know one thing, I got the game from you, every perspective<end_line>
That's why I keep the gun at close connection for protection<end_line>
And you see I left school behind and chose CMB<end_line>
It was impossible on the road every week, but I know enough<end_line>
And I follow by everything you ever told me, think wisely<end_line>
Watch over me my nigga, just guide me<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I swear to you man, at some times I really wish I was with you<end_line>
'Cause I get fed up with this life and I miss you<end_line>
Somebody pass me a tissue, and let me wipe the tears from my eyes<end_line>
Yeah, nigga I cried, it's 'cause I loved you dog<end_line>
I promise I won't ever put nothin above you dog<end_line>
So I live my life in dedication of you dog<end_line>
I know you see me happy on the outside and hurt within<end_line>
Make me wanna grab that gun and burst again<end_line>
But I know they got a reason why I'm here<end_line>
And I know they got a reason why you gone<end_line>
And therefore, I'm succeedin on my own<end_line>
But you ain't never left me, nigga, you still dwell in my heart<end_line>
I can't forget you kept it real from the start<end_line>
And until my last breath I exhale, I'm a keep you with me<end_line>
And when we do meet again, I'm a keep you with me<end_line>
And tell them niggas Pac, B.I.G. and Pun I said "thay's my peoples"<end_line>
Watch over me nigga 'til I see you<end_line>
<verse_end>
