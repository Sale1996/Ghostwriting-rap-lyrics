<verse_start>
You can find me on the corner with stones, quarters and zones<end_line>
or dope and powder broke, and our sale's soap and flour<end_line>
And most of our customers come up to us daily<end_line>
Yet and still I cut this stuff crazy - a hustler, baby<end_line>
What can I give you? I distribute ki's to the kings<end_line>
and z's to the fiends, and ecstasy and weed to the teens<end_line>
You need to see Wheez - anything you like and I have 'em<end_line>
From crack to Viagra, and Vicadins valiums<end_line>
I'm the nigga they point to when you hit my av<end_line>
So get all your money together, come and get my slabs<end_line>
I get my cash, put some aside, and flip like half<end_line>
And still enough for me to TV and deep-dish my Nav'<end_line>
And you can tell the law that I say they can kiss my acid<end_line>
For the white people,<end_line>
when I get two bricks for ten, I know the right people<end_line>
And I keep a nine on my waistline<end_line>
And I'ma be right on the corner, wodie - I'm gonna grind<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I tell 'em, "Whaaat!!"<end_line>
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time<end_line>
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes<end_line>
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine<end_line>
Nigga, I'm on the grind<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Nigga, y'all gon' respect Wheezy, or else the tec squeezin' shots<end_line>
I have your chest steamin' hot, and your sis' screamin', "Stop!"<end_line>
I hang out on the block, nigga, with rocks and weed<end_line>
On the corner 'til the mornin', see the cops and flee<end_line>
And if we beef, we don't beef long 'cause we gon' creep all night<end_line>
So I hope you don't sleep all night - we on your street all night<end_line>
Say, aw aw, I don't want your boy to get me shoes<end_line>
'cause I spit tools, and put him tissues in his shoes<end_line>
And the bricks move every followin' week<end_line>
So if you need to get it, too, then holla at me - got powder or d<end_line>
And I shower your streets until your av pass out<end_line>
More bricks than The Three Lil Pigs' last damn house<end_line>
Stack crack and lay back, and just laugh at droughts<end_line>
And issue work for half and just grab that south<end_line>
For real, nigga - Wheezy Whee tryin' to shine<end_line>
From daybreak to nightfall I'm gon' grind<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I tell 'em, "Whaaat!!"<end_line>
You see me hustlin' on the block all the time<end_line>
Sittin' at the table, breakin' ki's down to dimes<end_line>
Sooner or later this neighborhood gon' be mine<end_line>
Nigga, I'm on the grind<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Start from grams to ounces to quarters to halves to ki's<end_line>
Takes seconds to minutes to hours to days and to weeks<end_line>
Gotta grind, work, hustle, struggle, and get it<end_line>
Gotta buy, cook it, cut it, sell it, and flip it<end_line>
And I flight everyday and night from the corner to the avenue<end_line>
And I'll sleep next week, man, I got yay, dope, and crack to move<end_line>
Ask them dudes when Wheezy open shop, I ain't got a bag to lose<end_line>
Especially if I don't like who sent 'em to me and I'ma tax a dude<end_line>
Duck the Feds and drama like I duck my baby momma<end_line>
Sometimes I play it sour - what you thought was yay was flour<end_line>
I pull whatever for the cheddar - nigga gotta flash and floss<end_line>
Drought come around, then it's jack the cost or jack the boss<end_line>
Cock the gun, then I push rocks 'til I spot the sun<end_line>
All day I hung the block, I see the cops and run<end_line>
I'm tryin' to get rich 'cause I wan' shine<end_line>
You can find me on the block, nigga, all the time<end_line>
