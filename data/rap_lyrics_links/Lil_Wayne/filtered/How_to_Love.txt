When you was just a young'un your looks were so precious<end_line>
But now your grown up, so fly it's like a blessin<end_line>
but you, can't have a man look at you for five seconds<end_line>
without you being insecure<end_line>
You never credit yourself, so when you got older<end_line>
It's seems like you came back ten times over<end_line>
Now you're, sittin here, in this damn corner<end_line>
Lookin through all your thoughts and lookin over your shoulder<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Ohh and you had a lot of dreams that transform to visions<end_line>
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions<end_line>
But it - wasn't your fault, wasn't in your intentions<end_line>
To be the one here talkin to me, be the one listenin but<end_line>
But I admire your poppin bottles and dippin<end_line>
Just as much as you admire bartendin and strippin baby<end_line>
So don't be mad, nobody else trippin<end_line>
You seem a lot of crooks and the crooks still crooked<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
See I just want you to know<end_line>
That you deserve the best, you're beautiful<end_line>
You're beautiful, yeah<end_line>
And I want you to know<end_line>
You're far from the usual<end_line>
Far from the usual<end_line>
<verse_end>
