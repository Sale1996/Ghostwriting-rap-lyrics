<verse_start>
Snakes in the grass, so I stay on the pavement<end_line>
Survived the battle with animals and cavemen<end_line>
And dead animals and dead men<end_line>
I'm all in and my only friend is Amen<end_line>
Keep your mouth closed, you wanna know why you die<end_line>
The answer's right under your nose<end_line>
Exposed to the street, in the game I don't cheat<end_line>
I just play my position, get MVP<end_line>
I get money, don't shit come free<end_line>
It's my life and I run it even when<end_line>
Keep my business in my pockets, don't wash with bleach<end_line>
And I never show my hand, not even to me<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Look, as the crooked World revolves<end_line>
Love spelt backwards is evol<end_line>
And Evil spelt backwards is live or live<end_line>
And when death comes you better have lives to give<end_line>
I spit that real talk like knives to ribs<end_line>
And rats die ugly, die with kids<end_line>
These niggaz is snitching and still living<end_line>
I hope my words are like razors to the bitches<end_line>
Niggaz pretend like they actually in<end_line>
But when it go down they fuck around and be them<end_line>
That blood look familiar when it's leaking<end_line>
If you scared, go see a Deacon nigga<end_line>
That ain't love<end_line>
<verse_end>
