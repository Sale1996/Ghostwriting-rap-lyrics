Understand I been in that water like I'm a dolphin<end_line>
Miami, Khaled took me in like an orphan<end_line>
Why did they start him, now they can't park him<end_line>
I go into the booth and just change like Clark Kent<end_line>
Lamborghini dark tint, philly bustin Carson<end_line>
I'm by myself to niggas running mouths like auctions<end_line>
