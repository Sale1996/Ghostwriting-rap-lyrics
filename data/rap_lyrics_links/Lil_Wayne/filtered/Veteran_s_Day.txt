<verse_start>
I like my pussy a little wetter, my drinks a little colder<end_line>
my girls a little older with her hair past her shoulders<end_line>
like my weed a little stronger, my money a lot longer<end_line>
if blooding aint right than I couldn't be a wronger<end_line>
I'm a bad muthafucker, be very afraid<end_line>
boy this heat will give your ass a raspberry beret<end_line>
been in the building muthafucker we aint never escape<end_line>
cash money is the army, veterans day<end_line>
the block got hotter, the World got colder<end_line>
so fuck a diamond chain we wearing guns on our shoulder<end_line>
if you want it you can get it, come and sign up<end_line>
we got choppers that will put that Tony Romo 9 up<end_line>
man we so about it, 5 star count it<end_line>
could have fucked the World but I left it how I found it<end_line>
took the game to school now I'm bout to cap and gown it<end_line>
got a circle of success you can say I'm way around it<end_line>
