When I step to the plate the outfield gets back<end_line>
Cause they know I'm the over the wall type of dog<end_line>
So many back to back hits they call me little Sammy Sosa<end_line>
Bubble gum cards and all the posters<end_line>
Y'all know, how I roast ya when it's time to compete<end_line>
On the field, on the court, over any hot beat<end_line>
or break, and you know it when you see your clone<end_line>
And right now that's all I see goin on, holla at me<end_line>
Game time, all I think about is bringin home the trophy<end_line>
If your team is better mine, you really gotta show me<end_line>
Really gotta beat me, really gotta trash talk<end_line>
Mistreat me, and send my squad back home<end_line>
Cause I don't know lose too much<end_line>
Matter fact, I ain't never lost at all<end_line>
When I'm playin Hardball<end_line>
So, if you on the mound about to pitch to me<end_line>
Understand I'm like Griffey, I keep 'em to the wall<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
This goes out to them jocks that stay on my jock, throwin the pop<end_line>
Keep pitchin, I'm in the kitchen makin radio rock<end_line>
It's usually preferred, I be choosy with all my words<end_line>
Throwin eggs at them chickenheads, beggin on the curb<end_line>
Direct from my burb, a fast baller with a curve<end_line>
Have her slidin home, tellin her friends just in the third<end_line>
I'm sure ya done heard, who I'm doin and what I'm doin<end_line>
What's false and what's true and..<end_line>
When it comes to this game they call me Zane McGwire<end_line>
That other kid was just a Mark, so I made him retire<end_line>
See we all got a base, and we hold our own<end_line>
But when I - come up to bat, we all goin come home<end_line>
And our fans cheers us on cause they know what the drill is<end_line>
Goin, out of the field into your automobile<end_line>
And I hope it ain't your Range Rover that you spent your change over<end_line>
I'm in the dugout with my tongue out player game over<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Listen, listen, listen<end_line>
They call me young Wheezy Rodriguez<end_line>
You know I'm gettin it hot as the bullet thatKennedy, y'know<end_line>
And I keep the chrome bat swingin, slingin that iron<end_line>
Pitch on the block like Nolan Ryan<end_line>
Too bad for TV, you won't see me I'm right in the streets<end_line>
I'm a hustler, people, my life in the streets<end_line>
Watch the game, get you wife in the sheets<end_line>
My watch, my chain, and my teeth cost<end_line>
That way I will never cheap talk<end_line>
And I call mami sweetheart, she call me sweet daddy<end_line>
And she gladly, loves the way that daddy bat it, yeah baby<end_line>
Wheezy Weez a player baby, and I don't share baby<end_line>
So if you searchin for someain't nuttin here, baby<end_line>
Catch me throwin an eighty in the latest Bentley, goin out<end_line>
And Wheezy never hit a foul, a Hot Guy<end_line>
Don't hit pop flies, I knock it up out the park<end_line>
And after the game's over we gon' meet up after dark<end_line>
<verse_end>
