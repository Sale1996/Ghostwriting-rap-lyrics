It's Weezy F. Crazy<end_line>
You scary ass rappers on the beat I'm wes craven<end_line>
But I'm eastside till I reside in the grave<end_line>
And you walk in my basement and see the bodies I'm saving<end_line>
Blood bath flow, yes it's time for some bathing<end_line>
Shotty with a drum and I'm a play it like a cadence<end_line>
Invasion, I cook ya like the Asians<end_line>
Put bread on ya head like a raisin<end_line>
You a danish, you need glazing<end_line>
Pardon me man, but I'm craving<end_line>
I got you in the oven, but I'm waiting<end_line>
I'm patient, for my patient<end_line>

Young money creatures<end_line>
Kill your sweet ass then eat you motherfucker<end_line>
