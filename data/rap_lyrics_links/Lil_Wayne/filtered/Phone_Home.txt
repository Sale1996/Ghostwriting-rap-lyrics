<verse_start>
We are not the same I am a martian<end_line>
And I'm hotter than summer rain like Carl Thomas<end_line>
Lock, load, ready to aim at any target<end_line>
I could get your brains for a bargain<end_line>
Like I bought it from target<end_line>
Hip hop is my supermarket<end_line>
Shopping cart full of fake hip hop artists<end_line>
I'm starving, sorry I gotta eat all it<end_line>
And I'll be back in the morning<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
We are not the same I am a alien<end_line>
Like Gonzales, young college student who done<end_line>
Just flipped the game like Houston, I'm used to<end_line>
Promethazine in two cups I'm screwed up<end_line>
And you ain't shit if you ain't never been screwed up<end_line>
Flow so sick make you wanna throw your food up<end_line>
Ice water chest, and my wrist like a cool cup<end_line>
Two twin clippers, I give your ass a crew cut<end_line>
I get bread like cold cuts you know what?<end_line>
Your girl go down fast, come up slow, but I never slow up<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
They don't make 'em like me no more<end_line>
Matter fact, they never made it like me before<end_line>
I'm rare like Mr. Clean with hair<end_line>
No break lights on my car rear<end_line>
I never hade life, and I never had fear<end_line>
I rap like I done died and gone to heaven I swear<end_line>
And yeah I'm a bear like black and white hair<end_line>
So I'm polar<end_line>
And they can't get on my system 'cause my system is the solar<end_line>
I am so far from the outhers, I mean others<end_line>
I could eat them for supper, get in my spaceship and hover, hover<end_line>
<verse_end>
