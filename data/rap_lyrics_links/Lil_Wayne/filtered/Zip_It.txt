I'm sittin' on the front of the bed, gun by my feet<end_line>
The dick was too good, the bitch still asleep<end_line>
Since a pussy got lips I guess you niggas could speak<end_line>
You niggas bluffin' like snow, you niggas just sleet<end_line>
Okay, I stick to the G-Code, you stick to the zip code<end_line>
Money tall like Benjamin Franklin on tiptoes<end_line>
Your bitch a blowfish, she swallow my fishing pole<end_line>
I aim at your head, it's coming off like stripper clothes<end_line>
I fuck with guerillas, bust at the Feds<end_line>
I bet your mouth can't run if I cut off your legs<end_line>
I'm fly like a zipper but that ain't the point<end_line>
My bullets fat as a joint you hear it crack like a voice<end_line>
I come to wet up the party, you niggas is garbage<end_line>
Hollow tips on the cartridge I let it rip through your cartilage<end_line>
One number, three letters, nine, A-K<end_line>

Bare hand, no mitten<end_line>
If my name get mentioned my nigga gon' slay him<end_line>
Catch 'em broad day with your bitch, a nigga still gon' spray him<end_line>
What it cost to merk a snitch? Ho, that's cheap labor<end_line>
If you survive these 50 shots you was in God's favor<end_line>
Big guns, I'm a send your mom my condolences<end_line>
But if she with you when I hit you<end_line>
You know how us niggas from New Orleans is<end_line>
Everybody get it, everybody gon' feel it, nobody exempt<end_line>
Every charge I got was a murder<end_line>
In the booth, nigga, ain't no attempts<end_line>

Ends up in the booth, no one's off in this bitch<end_line>

I tried to kill 'em them beggars, I play by letting them in<end_line>
Like the riding belatos, your empty hand meant a hint<end_line>
I got caught in the morning, me and the district attourney<end_line>
Told my lawyer don't sell it, let's take this bitch for a journey<end_line>
They ain't catch me with nothing, I don't know who say it though<end_line>
It's always one in their mind, I don't know who say it both<end_line>
Shoot out love for my niggas, inside I thought they were racks<end_line>
How we running the projects, we was like dolls in the pack<end_line>
Growing up in the classics, you need a better new weapon<end_line>
Everybody got beat the shit like a delicates<end_line>

Bitches started the business, she in the system again<end_line>
