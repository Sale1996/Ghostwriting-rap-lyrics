<verse_start>
Ah-em...<end_line>
Shawty want a thug<end_line>
It started with a hug<end_line>
And her ass one night<end_line>
This, I gave her neck a kissy-kiss<end_line>
She gave my neck a kiss back<end_line>
I said we could do it like a stack<end_line>
I mean we could do it like a g<end_line>
On the couch in V.I.P.<end_line>
Shawty we could get it on<end_line>
I'm like, shot-out to the DJ for playin this song<end_line>
Girl we could act like two damn fools<end_line>
And everybody think we doin a dance move<end_line>
Call me, so that I can get'chu to fly and meet me in the bathroom<end_line>
And you could be my secret lovey-dove<end_line>
And it started with a hug<end_line>
But now we makin love in this club<end_line>
And when I come stylin just because<end_line>
The people in the crowd are watchin us<end_line>
But we don't give a damn what they say<end_line>
They said "Da-da remix bay-bay!"<end_line>
