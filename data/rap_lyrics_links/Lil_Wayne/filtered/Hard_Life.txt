Nigga, the block look the same - it's just crack and cocaine<end_line>
Niggas losin' but we still maintainin'<end_line>
Livin' life like a penitentiary with a ki in my hand<end_line>
Knockin' project bricks<end_line>
Flippin' chickens, and movin' out quick<end_line>
Hard-hustlin' 'cause we love slingin' this white shit<end_line>
S.S., Monte Carlo's, hard-tops - we love that shit<end_line>
'Bout two-hundred thugs with this clique<end_line>
We multiply everyday for the bullshit<end_line>
For the hood shit<end_line>
Burned down buildin's ain't no good, slick<end_line>
Niggas pullin' auctions on they own cars to get money quick<end_line>
Then we dippin' and dabbin'<end_line>
Goin' back to the labbin'<end_line>
Lil' niggas payin' me for cookin' they slabbin'<end_line>
Cook a brick and make it out a brick-and-halfin'<end_line>

On the streets it ain't sweet<end_line>
They be<end_line>
It's not a game, homeboy - this ain't the NFL<end_line>
Him justfrom rippin' with the mid-deck twelve<end_line>
Hit the block in twin-SL's, and spit at gals<end_line>
You get that, pal?<end_line>
Once it's war, nigga, skip town<end_line>
'Cause if I don't do it, be swimmin' with fish, clown<end_line>
Now, crack a whole chick down, sell it in quarters<end_line>
If the drama happen to hit town, I'm 'nappin' your daughter<end_line>
If the broad try to flip out, I'm cuttin' her water<end_line>
If your boys try to help out, I'm killin' they fathers<end_line>
When and wherever<end_line>
What and however - you bring it good<end_line>
I'll have your mom singin' "Hmmm hmm hmmm"<end_line>
Cause nowadays lot of niggas got coward ways<end_line>
So I ride with K's to knock off the side of heads<end_line>
But I'm tryin' to stay man, I'm tryin' to stay focused<end_line>
What I'm tryin' to say we gon' bust it wide open!<end_line>
