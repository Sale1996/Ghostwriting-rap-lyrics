They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder<end_line>
Well, I bet I couldn't look more bolder<end_line>
Hold her, as we dip into my solar<end_line>
Call me for baby, I explore her<end_line>
This navigator, you dont want like Lincoln<end_line>
Black Bentley, you look better in a pink one<end_line>
She smokin' and I'm about to steam one<end_line>
Let's skip and make love on Venus<end_line>
Baby the ball's in your court like Serenus<end_line>
Make me jump over that net, between us<end_line>
And let nothin' get between us<end_line>
We too hot, only sweat between us<end_line>
