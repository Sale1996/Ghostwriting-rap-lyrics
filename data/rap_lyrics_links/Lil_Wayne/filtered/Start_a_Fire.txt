<verse_start>
I'm like goodness gracious, great wall of China<end_line>
All we do is fuck all day, all ma√±ana<end_line>
It's a cold world, I stay warm inside her<end_line>
Make her perspire, sweat, blood, and cry and<end_line>
Goodness gracious, great God Almighty<end_line>
She fuck me like a +King+ -- Stephen, Martin, Rodney<end_line>
We break all of monotony, baby we high commodity<end_line>
And they just don't get it<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Like goodness gracious, great balls of fire<end_line>
She ridin' me like +A Streetcar Named Desire+<end_line>
Stop, drop, roll, and shake what her mama, gave her<end_line>
Clap that ass like the choir<end_line>
Ooh, I ran into my old thing<end_line>
I said "Bitch you broke my heart, but that's just growin' pains"<end_line>
But trust me, she ain't nothin' but an old flame<end_line>
I threw water on that old flame, no more flames<end_line>
I'm so glad I'm out the dope game<end_line>
Cause now I got more time to burn in that pussy like some propane<end_line>
Now that pussy is my domain<end_line>
And I know they just don't get it, they just don't get it<end_line>
<verse_end>
