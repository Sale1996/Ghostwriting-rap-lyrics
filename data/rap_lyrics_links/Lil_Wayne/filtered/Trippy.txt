Blue skies, blue skies, I see you with my red eyes<end_line>

My skin crawlin, my walls talkin, the pictures in here lookin at me<end_line>
The ground movin, I'm seein shit, I'm blowin like I'm stuck in traffic<end_line>
I'm smoking on that strong, got me +coffin+ like I'm gettin buried<end_line>
I've been fuckin Mary Jane, I knew her when she was just Virgin Mary<end_line>
I'm stoned, +Mick Jagger+, I can run around Saturn<end_line>
Eyes rollin back, and keep blinkin like hazards<end_line>
I said king me, king me with my mushroom, crown on<end_line>
I graduated to better drugs, my cap and - gown on<end_line>
Don't knock me off my high horse, what I do is my choice<end_line>
I'm high as the scoreboard, bitch look up at my points<end_line>

I don't know if I'm comin or goin, T make my blunt a Samoan<end_line>
And I see lights flashin, life passin, take a bitch home fuck like rabbits<end_line>
Styrofoam cups and wine glasses, shot glasses, hot flashes<end_line>
My tongue numb, I can't talk, no balance, my spine hurts<end_line>
My mind surf, my eye jerks, I try different drugs, I'm diverse<end_line>
Goodbye Earth - farewell; high as heaven, eyes low as hell<end_line>
Keep scratchin, keep bitin my nails, keep lightin an L, I'm a kite in the air<end_line>
I like weed brownies and cookies, I'm straight but seein crooked<end_line>
I got my trippy kit, I hope I trip and fall in some pussy - Tunechi~!<end_line>
