Heyeah, that's more like it - Junior!<end_line>
They say the blacker the berry, the redder the cherry<end_line>
I say the sweeter it is, ya dig? Bury<end_line>
Then the bullshit varies, and it got me weary<end_line>
But I know two of the same, call it murdered and married<end_line>
Hustlin is so necessary, with no adversaries<end_line>
But ain't no love, like a calendar with no FebruaryÂ’s<end_line>
I'ma need four secretary, and four bloody mary's<end_line>
I'ma go eat me some pussy, and choke off the cherry I'm gone<end_line>
