<verse_start>
With everything happening today<end_line>
You don't know whether you're comin or goin<end_line>
But, you think that you're on your way<end_line>
Life lined up on the mirror don't blow it<end_line>
Woo~! Look at me when I'm talkin to you<end_line>
You lookin at me but I'm lookin through you<end_line>
I see the blood in your eyes<end_line>
I see the love in disguise<end_line>
I see the pain hidden in your pride<end_line>
I see you're not satisfied<end_line>
And I don't see nobody else<end_line>
I see myself, I'm lookin at the<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Uhh, I see the truth in your lies<end_line>
I see nobody by your side<end_line>
But I'm with you when you're all alone<end_line>
And you correct me when I'm lookin wrong<end_line>
I see the guilt beneath the shame<end_line>
I see your soul through your window pain<end_line>
I see the scars that remain<end_line>
I see Wayne, I'm lookin at the<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Lookin at me now, I can see my past<end_line>
Damn~! I look just like my fuckin dad<end_line>
Light it up, that's smoke and mirrors<end_line>
I even look good in the broken mirror<end_line>
I see my momma smile that's a blessin<end_line>
I see the change, I see the message<end_line>
And no message could been any clearer<end_line>
So I'm startin with the man in the<end_line>
<verse_end>
