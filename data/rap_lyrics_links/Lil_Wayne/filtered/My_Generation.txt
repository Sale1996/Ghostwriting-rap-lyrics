If you weather that storm<end_line>
Then that Rain bring Sun<end_line>
Been a long time coming<end_line>
I know change go' come<end_line>
Man I gotta keep it moving<end_line>
To the beat of my drum<end_line>
Last night I set the future <end_line>
At the feet of my son<end_line>
But they thinking that my Generation<end_line>
Gotta die young<end_line>
If we all come together<end_line>
Then they can't divide one<end_line>
Don't worry 'bout it<end_line>
Just be about it<end_line>
Got a message from God<end_line>
Heaven too crowded<end_line>
But I say <end_line>
Hey Young World!<end_line>
You never looked better<end_line>
And I heard change start<end_line>
With the man in the mirror<end_line>
This Generation<end_line>
I'm a represent<end_line>
A generation led by a Black President<end_line>
Now how's that for change?<end_line>
Who knew that could change?<end_line>
I don't even look at the flag the same <end_line>
Heak, Uh!<end_line>
So when you finish reading Revelations<end_line>
Thank God for my Generation<end_line>
