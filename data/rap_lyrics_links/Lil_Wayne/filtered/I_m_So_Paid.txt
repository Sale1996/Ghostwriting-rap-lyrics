<verse_start>
Ah-umm, big money Weezy<end_line>
White wife beater with the sig' underneath it<end_line>
How do I feel? Bitch I feel undefeated<end_line>
Snap my fingers disappear from the precinct<end_line>
Yeah, I'm ballin, we ball out<end_line>
Ball 'til we fall until the ball bounce<end_line>
I send some niggaz with guns to y'all house<end_line>
Only to find out you live in a dollhouse<end_line>
Damnbut I thought you was tough though<end_line>
We carry choppers on our necks, call it cutthroat<end_line>
We bury cowards on the set that they come from<end_line>
We know magic, turn weed smoke to gun smoke<end_line>
WEball first when we ride<end_line>
Youin a hearse when you ride<end_line>
I put my shoe down baby<end_line>
And I'm holdin down Young Moolah baby<end_line>
