They call me the youngest headbuster walkin'<end_line>
Thugged out in all black, calicole sparklin'<end_line>
A guerilla till I die bless me when I'm dead<end_line>
But for the bread I bring ya anybody head<end_line>
That's how I play it I don't hold back<end_line>
I tote gats be on the spot were ya sold crack<end_line>
Nigga feel played then ya fuckin get blown back<end_line>
I burn 'em twice with a black rusty old mac<end_line>
Now BLOCKA nigga get off me<end_line>
