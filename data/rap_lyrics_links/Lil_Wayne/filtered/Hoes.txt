<verse_start>
I got old school bitches and new school hoes<end_line>
Female basketball players with cornrolls<end_line>
And I don't like short-haired girls, no not really<end_line>
If I do, she gotta look like the old Halle Berry<end_line>
Or the broke Toni Braxton, the first Lil Kim<end_line>
But I still take hood rats and work with them<end_line>
Put yo ass in a jag and I drop ya quick<end_line>
Give ya ass a lil game, if ya smirk ya in<end_line>
I'm a pimp, not a simp, like ice in my drink<end_line>
And I don't think twice or blink cause I'm focused<end_line>
Rollin in the whitest mink like I'm polar<end_line>
Bear, yea, let down my hair<end_line>
Get jazzy on a bitch like Fred Astaire<end_line>
Rose gold in her face get her red as glare<end_line>
My Bentley plum, my Mercedes pear<end_line>
I am lookin for a freak, mama take me there, yea<end_line>
