<verse_start>
The loser, microphone abuser<end_line>
Feet hurtin, I just walked from Jerusalem<end_line>
So you should get on the side with the movement<end_line>
I'm the proof and I'll die just to prove it<end_line>
What'cha wanna know? Anything whatever<end_line>
I can't tell ya, I could show ya better<end_line>
Me me and my gun, we took an oath together<end_line>
Said I will never die, if we both together<end_line>
Yea! This is my testifacation<end_line>
I'ma weigh-in on they heads like precipitation<end_line>
And in Hell, you you need justification<end_line>
But, but for me it was just a vacation<end_line>
Hehehehe, yeah<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
But if I fall I fall up, and let the clouds hug me<end_line>
And If I fall down I bet I hit the gound runnin<end_line>
Bet you search and found nothin, lookin for the finish line<end_line>
Stop shortcuttin, you fucking up yo' finish time<end_line>
Geyeah, but every twice in a while<end_line>
It feels like I'm runnin, and life is the miles<end_line>
Yeah! But until the lights dimmin down<end_line>
I'll be runnin 'round, runnin<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
It's almost over now<end_line>
I said it's almost over now<end_line>
The end is gettin closer now<end_line>
Better do what your supposed to<end_line>
cause the world is on your shoulders now<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Yeah! I'm runnin outta time, I'm runnin out of space<end_line>
Feel like I'm runnin 'round, but I'm runnin in place<end_line>
We all in the race, I'm just another sprinter<end_line>
If there's no finish line, then who's the real winner?<end_line>
<verse_end>
