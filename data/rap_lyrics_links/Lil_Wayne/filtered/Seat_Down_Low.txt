Listen, I like my seat down low and my window slightly cracked<end_line>
Ridin wit a bad hoe, with her girlfriend in the back<end_line>
I like to get real high and I never look back<end_line>
And you don't wanna try me and don't I look strapped?<end_line>
I come from the hardest city, ain't nobody fuckin wit it<end_line>
Got black and gold soul, wit a fresh New Orleans fitted<end_line>
And a collared polo and a pair of bally bucks<end_line>
Young Money muthafucka, know you worred bout us<end_line>
Cash Money muthafucka, see I'm all I trust<end_line>
Never had my jaw broken, but his jaw I bust<end_line>
And I probably got your girlfriend on my bus<end_line>
What happens on my bus, stays on my bus<end_line>
And that white widow weed, out the jar is a must<end_line>
If you give me a cigar, then a cigar I'll bust<end_line>
Put that white widow weed in the cigar and puff<end_line>
Look ma, I'm tryna make a porno, starring us<end_line>
Well not just us, a couple foreign sluts<end_line>
Yea, we make this song a Noritwallin Dawllin<end_line>
I be with Jim Jones and we be ballin ballin<end_line>
Yea baby we ballin, like Rawlins and Spalding<end_line>
Pint of DJ Screw and that hawaiian<end_line>
I am leaning like a 3 legged lion, climbing<end_line>
Right to the top of the muthafuckin mountain.. counting<end_line>
I'm gonna need me an accountant who counts it<end_line>
Mannie got this fuckin beat poundin, it's poundin<end_line>
But it was just lost, until I found it, I found it<end_line>
Stole it like a scoundrel, Hollygrove hound it<end_line>
Put this bitch to sleep, fuckin right I night-gowned it<end_line>
Niggaz talkin cheap, tell them niggaz pipe down bitch<end_line>
Bloods in the building, now everybody soundless<end_line>
Beatin up this track like a muthafuckin round-fist<end_line>
Blind, deaf, or crazy, I'ma spit like a long kiss<end_line>
I am just a martian, ain't nobody else on this.. planet<end_line>
I know, see I live by my only<end_line>
Say where my cheese nigga? Where my macaroni?<end_line>
Baby I get up in dat ass, and act a donkey<end_line>
Candy on candy, nigga grippin the grain<end_line>
See I'm the only fire that can live in the rain<end_line>
I am so so New Orleans<end_line>
Like 1825 Tulane<end_line>
