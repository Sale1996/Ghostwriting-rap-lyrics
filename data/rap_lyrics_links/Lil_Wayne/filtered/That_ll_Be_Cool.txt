Now let me brush off my Puma's<end_line>
This is for the early birds and the late bloomers<end_line>
My fitted cocked and so is the boomer<end_line>
My money ain't funny, but they got a since of humor<end_line>
And everybody dies, but snitches die sooner<end_line>
Paint your shirt and room like a Oklahoma Sooner<end_line>
I'm out of this world, lunar<end_line>
I've got cheese cake like juniors'<end_line>
The coolest kid on the school yard<end_line>
Higher then a uniform, scared?<end_line>
I got work at home, call it home work<end_line>
I got paper in my backpack<end_line>
I know you smell me, I'm the shit like an exlac... Oooh!<end_line>
Diarrhea Dwayne<end_line>
Bust your fucking head, souvenir your brain<end_line>
You ain't talking about nothing<end_line>
Got your girl leaving out my house, walking out of my house funny<end_line>
Like her legs are telling jokes<end_line>
I swear you would have thought it was like a DJ honcho<end_line>
And we ain't talking slow, you just listening fast<end_line>
Boy I'm sitting on green like piss in the grass<end_line>
Just let me know, and the grass still grow, even if you mow<end_line>
I'm so N.O<end_line>

That'll be cool<end_line>

So fresh, so dope<end_line>
Head to the show<end_line>
Sitting on a white and black car with Orealeo<end_line>
14 is so nice, my flow is so tight<end_line>
If you trying to see me leave left, go right<end_line>
Me and Wayne on the same track, Ohh I just like that<end_line>
With Bizzile on that Cadillacs, but as sharp as a thumb tack<end_line>
I'm so Young Money, get like Twist dude<end_line>
I can be a school boy and a "G" like Ice Cube<end_line>
Like watching Next Friday<end_line>
Move kid out of my way, it is my way, yes it is my day<end_line>
Boy, look at her, It's Young Money roll<end_line>
We just swerve Maserati<end_line>
But a coke wadd with sizzle of those from Universal now<end_line>
I ain't talking about the label<end_line>
I'm in a different city but were connected like cable<end_line>
Ya, we go straight, seven to sable<end_line>
We put rhymes in your head, ya'll put money on the table<end_line>

Young in the game of girls<end_line>
Showing black harts and stars<end_line>
The kid of the south runs things, they easy<end_line>
Believe me, I'm running hard Obama to Hillary<end_line>
It ain't over, got my green and celery<end_line>
It's on my dice, it's on my body, young with a felony<end_line>
Iced up<end_line>
Wayne couldn't help but notice<end_line>
He just bought a Lambo and got me a new Lotus<end_line>

Money on top, I ain't a Rockefeller, but I hold up the rock, and then ain't nobody going stop, me<end_line>
From doing my thing in like big talk<end_line>
