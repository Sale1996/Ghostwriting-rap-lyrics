Nigga I ain't got a money printer<end_line>
So for this paper chase I'm out runnin' sprinters<end_line>
Yes the last two Cash Money members<end_line>
Shout out to the new Cash Money members<end_line>
Baby and Slim still point guard and center<end_line>
So much money on my mind it's all I remember<end_line>
And I just bought a gun wit' a extender<end_line>
And that bitch hold me up like suspenders<end_line>
Cut like a blender sharper than a bitch<end_line>
They got so many pussy niggaz I can make a list<end_line>
Niggaz wonder why I stress that I am the best<end_line>
'Cause even bobble heads tell me yes.. haha<end_line>
Put it on the hood I'm Hollygrove to death<end_line>
I'm already good I'm workin' on my left<end_line>
A jungle on my wrist a circus on my neck<end_line>
Don't forget the Baby no don't forget the F<end_line>

This is a Scott Storch and I'm a hot torch<end_line>
And gettin' money is my sport<end_line>
And understand the rap game is my court<end_line>
So I shall walk and come forth like a Rockport<end_line>
Or some sort of... matchin' slippers or yacht shoes<end_line>
See I don't cruise control I control the cruise<end_line>
Yes... I gets throat on a boat<end_line>
And I vow to never fall like soap on a rope and<end_line>
