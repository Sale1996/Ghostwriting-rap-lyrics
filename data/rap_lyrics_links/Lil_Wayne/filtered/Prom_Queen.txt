<verse_start>
I loved her fancy underwear<end_line>
I sit behind her every year<end_line>
Waiting for the chance to get<end_line>
To tell her i'm the one she should be wit<end_line>
She's popular wit all the guys<end_line>
Only thing in my eyes<end_line>
I can see her in my life<end_line>
She woulda had the world if she were mine<end_line>
But see she had other plans<end_line>
I couldn't understand<end_line>
Her and her stupid friends<end_line>
Varsity's biggest fans<end_line>
Never forget the day<end_line>
She laughed and walked away<end_line>
And I couldn't stop her<end_line>
I guess she had it all..<end_line>

<verse_start>
They loved her fancy underwear<end_line>
Every boyfriend, every year<end_line>
She can't keep a man who's tame<end_line>
When they can hardly remember her name,<end_line>
She did everything she could<end_line>
Just to make them laugh and treat her good<end_line>
She finds herself alone<end_line>
Askin herself, where did she go wrong?<end_line>
She didn't realize<end_line>
She chased the type of guys<end_line>
Who don't believe in ties<end_line>
Tryin to apologize<end_line>
Never forget the day<end_line>
She left and walked away<end_line>
And I couldn't stop her<end_line>
I guess she had it all..<end_line>
<verse_end>

Yeah...uh<end_line>
