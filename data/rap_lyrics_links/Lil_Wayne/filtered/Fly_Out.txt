<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I got the game on ball and chain<end_line>
I threw the key in the train<end_line>
I'm like the key in the truck<end_line>
I spent a G on these frames, though my vision is priceless<end_line>
Seeing through you niggaz like a fuckin psychic<end_line>
Hearing through the grapevine, niggaz wanna hate mine<end_line>
Say my name and die in the daytime<end_line>
You catch my drift, man you better be Peyton<end_line>
Boy the heats on, they make a peace bond<end_line>
I'm in this bitch, throwing up the seventeenth sign<end_line>
Straight frowns, no daps, strapped three times<end_line>
A Tec-11, AK 47, one Beretta, ready for whatever<end_line>
Tell them pussy niggaz come together<end_line>
Heavy wetter, nigga super soaker wetter, nigga<end_line>
Six feet under flowers, you ain't nothing but a petal nigga<end_line>
I'm just a little nigga, trying to be a civil nigga<end_line>
Thirty years old, shit that'll be a different nigga<end_line>
Quit it Wayne, your Mom is listenin<end_line>
But she ain't really trippin, 'cause the pots is piston<end_line>
Them niggaz trippin, unitl the shots whistling'<end_line>
Hear them bullets sizzle, like a cobra at attention<end_line>
I gotta bitch, and quit callin women bitches<end_line>
As long as she don't worry 'bout the coke in the kitchen<end_line>
No preventing the crime, I gotta get it<end_line>
I'm admitted to the game, true playa, no quittin<end_line>
There you go shittin on a way a nigga thinkin<end_line>
Only history I know is Benjamin Franklin<end_line>
This is the future and crime is to no one<end_line>
I live everyday like this is the sure one<end_line>
Train in the tidal wave, this is the ocean<end_line>
Stand in the heat, 'til the mother fuckin snow come<end_line>
And it feels so fuckin good<end_line>
Throw my dope like a rope, let them tug and pull<end_line>
No hope for the hopeless, rats and roaches<end_line>
Runnin cross the porch, in the attic there's a fortune<end_line>
Come and get it, automatics in motion<end_line>
We bangin for the bread nigga, even the molded<end_line>
I got my loaf, I got my toast<end_line>
Chaperone of the south, I got my coast. Yea<end_line>
And unll I die I'm Da. Da Da Da Da. Da BEST RAPPER ALIVE<end_line>
