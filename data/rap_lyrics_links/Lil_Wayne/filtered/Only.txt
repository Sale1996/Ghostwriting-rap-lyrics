I never fucked Nicki and that's fucked up<end_line>
If I did fuck she'd be fucked up<end_line>
Whoever is hittin' ain't hittin' it right<end_line>
Cause she actin' like she need dick in her life<end_line>
That's another story, I'm no story teller<end_line>
I piss greatness like gold is yellow<end_line>
All my goons so overzealous<end_line>
I'm from Hollygrove, the holy Mecca<end_line>
Calender say I got money for days<end_line>
I squirm and I shake, but I'm stuck in my ways<end_line>
My girlfriend will beat a bitch up if she wave<end_line>
They bet not fuck with her surfboard, surfboard<end_line>
My eyes are so bright, I take cover for shade<end_line>
Don't have my money? I take mothers instead<end_line>
You got the hiccups, you swallowed the truth<end_line>
Then I make you burp, boy, treat beef like sirloin<end_line>
I'm talkin' bout runnin' in houses with army guns<end_line>
So think about your son and daughter rooms<end_line>
Got two hoes with me, messed up, they got smaller guns<end_line>
Ain't thinkin' bout your son and daughter rooms<end_line>
This is just crazy my nigga, I mean brazy, my nigga<end_line>
That money talk, I just rephrase it, my nigga<end_line>
Blood gang take the B out behavior, my nigga<end_line>
Fucking for reals if you mouth off I blow your face off<end_line>
I mean pop-pop-pop then I take off<end_line>
Now you see me, now you don't<end_line>
Like Jamie Foxx acting like Ray Charles<end_line>
16 in a clip, one in the chamber<end_line>
17 ward bully with 17 bullets<end_line>
My story is how I went from poor me<end_line>
To police pour me a drink and celebrate with me<end_line>
