What, what, what, what, what, what<end_line>
If I could change the world<end_line>
If I had the world, dog, I'd make hustlin' good<end_line>
And if I could I'd put work every hustler's hood<end_line>
I can't lie - this world is scary to me<end_line>
I carry two gats - you won't hear nobody buryin' me<end_line>
None of my people would have to pay tax or bills<end_line>
Even all the new niggas oughtta average a mill<end_line>
If I could change the score, we'd never hustle no more<end_line>
And every bizite that I lizight 'll be like "whoa"<end_line>
And the police would be for here only for the old folks<end_line>
So if we have a problem, we strap up and hold court<end_line>
If I could change it - man, if the world was mine<end_line>
Nobody'd have to take nothin' 'cause we'd all shine<end_line>
If I ruled the world, nigga wouldn't have no beef<end_line>
It'll be a decline in the murder rate on the streets<end_line>
If the world was mine we wouldn't need no killers<end_line>
We'll put A/C in these project windows<end_line>
If I could change the world<end_line>
Look - what, what, what, what, what<end_line>
