Original gangsta, black clothes and bangers<end_line>
Bullet shells and chambers, fill the L's up<end_line>
We stay low from the ranges cause they tryin to tame us, but we brainless<end_line>
And just think, I'm one sell out record away from being famous<end_line>
Shit I guess I ain't it<end_line>
You could paint it how you may, but I remain this gangsta 'til the day I lay<end_line>
where the worms stay<end_line>
I spit it for my nigga's sake<end_line>
I spit it for myself a long time ago<end_line>
Got a few houses, few whips, few condos<end_line>
I'm so straight I'm pointin<end_line>
The game is hurtin, and baby boy the ointment<end_line>
Baby boy the president now<end_line>
Shit you gotta make an appointment<end_line>
Two record labels<end_line>
You should come join 'em<end_line>
Do check the label<end_line>
And make sure it's yellow or rose 'fore you bring it to my table<end_line>

Naw, don't fuck with that dogg<end_line>
Yo, I'm gonna knock your fuckin head off<end_line>
And I'm coming back hard<end_line>
Stunner get me to work, and I'm runnin that off<end_line>

With a swagger you can't get, naw you can't get it<end_line>
Shit, bitch I pop like Diddy, I pop like when he goin stop? When it's empty<end_line>
And you still drawing Leonardo D'Vinci<end_line>
