Money ain't shit, bitches ain't neither<end_line>
You know I'm on that grass, don't cut on the sprinklers<end_line>
Pussy on my mind, on my breath and on my finger<end_line>
Niggaz try to bite my style but my style a jalapeno<end_line>
I got skinny-ass jeans, trucks on pocket<end_line>
Money talks nigga, I'm caught up in the gossip<end_line>
You know all my bitches badder, and all my Swishers fatter<end_line>
I milk this shit like cattle, that's my word like Scrabble<end_line>
And yo' main girl is a hoe, I go Wayne's World in her throat<end_line>
She swallows so many nuts you fuck around find a squirrel in her throat<end_line>
I go tapeworm on that hoe, let my snake squirm in that hoe<end_line>
Nigga we take turns in that hoe, these niggaz so green they glow<end_line>
I am the best thing since wet pussy on my private jet with my chef cookin<end_line>
So big headed my neck crooked my niggaz foul when the ref lookin<end_line>
My big bro is Mack Maine, so much weed I got grass stains<end_line>
Deez nuts, that's baggage claim, I'm on them trees like candy canes<end_line>
Lil Tunechi<end_line>

Alright, uhh<end_line>
All my niggaz gangstas, all my bitches freaks<end_line>
I tickle her pussy, got that pussy tickled pink<end_line>
I'm the heart of these streets, and I just skipped a beat<end_line>
And if that pussy sweet I want that candy trick or treat<end_line>
I got diamonds in my teeth, so all my words are precious<end_line>
I'm so fuckin hot I sssssssss, I'ma need some mo' S's<end_line>
Man I'm some other shit, I want another bitch<end_line>
that want another bitch, and I don't cuddle bitch<end_line>
I hit her with that shovel dick, I got in that pussy and dug a ditch<end_line>
Some people gotta punch the clock, man I'd rather punch a brick<end_line>
Cause I'm that nigga - and I'm so cold I just shivered<end_line>
These niggaz think they hard, these niggaz is nipples<end_line>
I pop a nigga like a sickle, drop a nigga like a missile<end_line>
Mo' money mo' issues, I size you up then fit you - Tunechi!<end_line>
