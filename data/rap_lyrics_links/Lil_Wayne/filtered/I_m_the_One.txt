Lookin' for the one? Well bitch, you're lookin' at the one<end_line>
I'm the best yet and yet my best is yet to come<end_line>
Cause I've been lookin' for somebody, not just any fuckin' body<end_line>
Don't make me catch a body, that's for any and everybody<end_line>
Oh my God, she hit me up all day, get no response<end_line>
Bitch you blow my high, that's like turnin' gold to bronze<end_line>
Roll my eyes, and when she on the molly, she a zombie<end_line>
She think we Clyde and Bonnie but it's more like Whitney and Bobby<end_line>
God forgive me, Tunechi F. finessin', I'm a legend<end_line>
Straight up out the Crescent, fly your bae down for the Essence<end_line>
For the record, I knew Khaled when that boy was spinnin' records<end_line>
Mula gang winnin' record, I'm just flexin' on my exes<end_line>
Oh God!<end_line>
