<verse_start>
I was drunk as a bitch, drunk as a bitch but not drunk as that bitch<end_line>
I got in that shit, acted donkey in it, junk in her trunk, hope my trunk key can fit<end_line>
Then she jumped on my dick like a monkey and shit, monkey see, monkey do, banana clips<end_line>
Shoot at them niggas, no camera glitch, wax that ass, no candle stick<end_line>
And I run with some killers, I eat with the mob, got some shit built up, I keep it inside<end_line>
Red in my eyes, Mount Everest high, look dead in my eyes, see death in my eyes<end_line>
The TEC on my thigh and my aim so good, I could shoot a fly or a bull in the eye<end_line>
Hold up, all bullshit aside, a nigga almost died but I'm out'chea<end_line>
Fuck around with a real nigga and get murked<end_line>
I been paid my dues, will I get reimbursed?<end_line>
Love it when she make faces, pussy feel like vacation<end_line>
Eat it like I'm dyin' of starvation, I'm at the finish line, her heart racin'<end_line>
Give her to Fuke if she Caucasian, my niggas wild as Jumanji<end_line>
You can call me an S.O.B cause it's Skateboards Over Bugattis<end_line>
I used to be at them Heat games with better seats than Pat Riley<end_line>
Don't stop, pop that don't stop, pop that Ollie - Tunechi<end_line>
