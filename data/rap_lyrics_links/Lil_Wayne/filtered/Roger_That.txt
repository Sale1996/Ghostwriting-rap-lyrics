<verse_start>
I'm goin' in!<end_line>
Fresh off the jet, sharper than Gillette<end_line>
The blunt still wet, so pass it like Brett<end_line>
We sip side of mug, we call it upset<end_line>
Smoke more than fo' quarters, we call it sudden debt<end_line>
I'm a beast.. you a pet<end_line>
AK long neck.. Keith Sweat, haha!<end_line>
Weezy motherfucker, Capo in this bitch with me<end_line>
Money talks and have a convo in this bitch with me<end_line>
I'm mountain high Colorado and this bitch with me<end_line>
Flow crazy 7:30, you just 6:50<end_line>
Twenty bullets from the chopper take the roof off<end_line>
Laughin to the bank, I'm a goofball<end_line>
Hahaha! It's YM<end_line>
And we at your neck, like a violin<end_line>
It's our world, we make it spin<end_line>
And y'all the prey.. amen!<end_line>
