When Young Money come through you better salute us<end_line>

I'm a purple heart proven war vet rookie<end_line>
You can't even sit next to me<end_line>
Now bring money or death to me, or don't step to me<end_line>
Now don't step nugga, march with me<end_line>
To the steps of the court buildin, like ain't we God's children?<end_line>

Salute, or shoot, nigga~!<end_line>
