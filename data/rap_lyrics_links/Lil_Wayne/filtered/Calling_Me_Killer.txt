But I don't care - I just grab my clip, slap and spray<end_line>
Anywhere - it don't matter where a nigga stay<end_line>
Just believe me when I say, "Guerrilla warfare"<end_line>
I swear, it be some more drama about these bags<end_line>
Niggas in black drive Jags - camouflage rags<end_line>
Niggas' domes get bust wide open with blood and sweat<end_line>
Niggas ridin' off in Hummers - laughin', drinkin' Moette<end_line>
You know me: Colleon, standin' four feet<end_line>
I'm to-tin' cannons, wearin' Rolies<end_line>
See, these lil' boys, they ain't really up on my game<end_line>
But once I run into that nigga playin' with Wayne, man<end_line>
See, when I spin-a you bend then I be on you block<end_line>
But when me jump out with the chop-chop, my nogga, you drop<end_line>
Now where your niggas at, comradie? They not with you now<end_line>
I guess they heard that when I'm ridin' I make the crew stop<end_line>
Now, is you 'bout what I'm 'bout?<end_line>
If you 'bout what I'm 'bout, you 'bout drama<end_line>
Thuggin' in broad day with four glocks, a knife, and a chopper<end_line>

Now U.P.T. come down - chopper city in the ghetto, my man<end_line>
Now who that be in the car with the chopper? Oh, it's Lil' Wayne<end_line>
I get my K - cock, aim, and put holes in your brain<end_line>
Give me that rag, you ain't no soldier - wipe the blood off my chain<end_line>
Gettin' blisty...<end_line>
...off in a black F-150<end_line>
'Bout to do the old usual - hit your block, just spittin'<end_line>
Heads spinnin' like a set of seventeens or somethin'<end_line>
Respect me for who I be: seventeen, head-bustin'<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Original Hot Boy - land-cruisin' with guns<end_line>
I shall be the one who burn the block up<end_line>
Never miss when I distribute anger up out my Cali'<end_line>
Hundred shots automatic<end_line>
Leave ya hopeless in the alley<end_line>
Now, when a nigga runs up<end_line>
If the nigga lovelesswould have his guns up<end_line>
Just because of the simple fact that I'm a Hot Boy,...<end_line>
...and got boys that got toys to stop noise<end_line>
See, when me ride off in the Hummer, leave him set empty<end_line>
Now him catch three 'cause him want beef<end_line>
Now, me tried to tell the stupid boy, "Don't mess-a with me."<end_line>
Now look at him - open up his casket and see<end_line>
Click-clack my mack, twist my Philly cap to the back<end_line>
Jump in the black and scream "war", and just "pow! pow!"<end_line>
How you love me now?  With five barrels to your eye<end_line>
The scene gets wild, and everybody gon' die<end_line>
What the dillio? Fill a four-four clip<end_line>
You'll get flipped for runnin' off at the lip<end_line>
Who behind the gun slang,...<end_line>
...blood hang,...<end_line>
...and twistin'?<end_line>
It's Mis-ter Wayne<end_line>
Come splittin' when I spit<end_line>
