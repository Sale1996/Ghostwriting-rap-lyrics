<verse_start>
Church, hand on my gun hand on my bible<end_line>
Fingers on the trigger like vagina<end_line>
The bible open right there on the dresser<end_line>
I just pray that all my enemies are watching me from heaven<end_line>
I'm peeking round the corner before I turn that muthafucka<end_line>
I played them corners like I'm Richard Sherman muthafucka<end_line>
I play in my position on these niggas 1st and 10<end_line>
Treating that prescription like a scripture amen<end_line>
Now we in the kitchen with the chickens and the hens<end_line>
Lord please forgive us but we sinning for the rent<end_line>
I just popped 2 pills I feel them bitches kickin in<end_line>
0-100 got a ticket in the Benz<end_line>
Show me where the bible say thou shall not ball<end_line>
I just hit a lick for a thousand Adderalls<end_line>
I just rolled a blunt up in a page from the bible<end_line>
And all my niggas psycho and all my bitches spiteful<end_line>
John 3:16<end_line>
