I get money hoe fuck what you talkin' 'bout<end_line>
Straight out the slaughterhouse straight out the dragon's mouth<end_line>
Fire you can't put out tires are standin' out<end_line>
The coupe look pigeon-toed I be in a different mode<end_line>
I be wit' them different hoes No I mean them different hoes<end_line>
I mean them Weezy bumbaclot different hoes<end_line>
And as far as terrific goes<end_line>
They kiss that dick wit' no mistletoes<end_line>
Diamonds and pearls and pussyholes snortin' coke til they nose bleed<end_line>
I'm sittin' high on them inches I'm in the nosebleeds<end_line>
I'm on a paper chase until my toes bleed<end_line>
Then I get on these beats and let my soul bleed<end_line>
I put 'em in ya head and watch the holes bleed<end_line>
My rag always red like when them hoes bleed<end_line>
Now that's coldbleed I mean cold blooded<end_line>
And I'm so southern that's why my leather so soft<end_line>

You see the paper gon' come if not I'm gon' get it<end_line>
I gotta die wit' money 'cause I wasn't born wit 'it<end_line>
It was 9-27-82 baby do Charity<end_line>
Hospital aka the city zoo no pity due to<end_line>
No one nobody not all man<end_line>
They dropped us in the game and everybody's tryna ball<end_line>
And the small hand'll touch ya the large hand'll cut ya<end_line>
But until that day I'll be a motherfuckin' stunna... nigga<end_line>
