Uhh, ooh, girl, I love you so<end_line>
Good lord almighty I'm in love with a whitey<end_line>
I call her Aphrodite, I call her when I need her<end_line>
And she give me good love 'til my nose start bleedin<end_line>
Life is just like movin mountains<end_line>
And when I can't cope, I'm hittin that slope<end_line>
That great white hope, and there ain't no pressure<end_line>
I cain't feel nothin but I never felt better<end_line>
Hmm, but you were just no good for me<end_line>
Killin me softly, that girl is poison, huh<end_line>
I had to let you go, take things slow<end_line>
But just so you know<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
You used to make me feel so good<end_line>
Like I was on top of the world<end_line>
I'm sorry that I gotta stay away from ya<end_line>
But that's what the doctor preferred<end_line>
My friends told me leave you alone<end_line>
And I just told 'em leave me alone<end_line>
It's sad how our thing had to end<end_line>
Our reltationship was short and sweet - Nia Long<end_line>
And I see her in the streets but I can't bring her home<end_line>
Man I was on her line all day, no phone<end_line>
Huh, no Arm & Hammer in my Tony Montana<end_line>
And truth is<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Uhh, sweet sugar hill<end_line>
Yeah I used to climb her<end_line>
I never imagined she turned out to be but a cheap thrill<end_line>
That's when it turned sour<end_line>
She gave me power, the world was ours<end_line>
I used to feel invincible on that flower<end_line>
But I had to change, yeah I had to change<end_line>
So I left her for a bitch named Mary Jane<end_line>
Now everythang is cool, everythang is fine<end_line>
Girl I'm movin on, I left you behind<end_line>
But every now and then you pop up on my mind<end_line>
I might fuck you one last time cause<end_line>
<verse_end>
