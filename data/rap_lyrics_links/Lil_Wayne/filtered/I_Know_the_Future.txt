<verse_start>
Straight from the bottom its the Carter<end_line>
I give it to these bitch niggas like momma taught me<end_line>
One man with no weapon at war but I'm an army<end_line>
My flow is capturing attention, leutenant your penny pention<end_line>
And they demolished that invention<end_line>
You better get your dollars up<end_line>
And guess what I was up<end_line>
I get my cheese like Mickey Mouse<end_line>
Or else you better Donald Duck<end_line>
Like a shootin range target I get all kind of bucks<end_line>
Be my shootin range target, nigga I got good luck<end_line>
Nigga bye bye good luck, got ya momma shook up<end_line>
Little bad ass nigga who thought Popeye wasnt tough<end_line>
I'm on that lala twist it up, I'm on that syrup slow it down<end_line>
And I like four freaks too and young choppers goin down<end_line>
About a marijuana field and I just smoke it down<end_line>
Big bad wolf yes, I just blow it down, no homo<end_line>
And to Holly Grove I will hold it down<end_line>
Like a circle of knives, I got the sharpest flow around<end_line>
Feel me<end_line>
