I'll be at your rescue and you don't even need me<end_line>
I could have you dreamin when you ain't even sleepin<end_line>
Mamma, I could help you get off, like the weekend<end_line>
She said she wanna do it to the new Enrique<end_line>
I pop the disc in and put the song on replay..<end_line>
And then she backed it up like replay<end_line>

<verse_start>
When you're near me..<end_line>
Girl, I try to hide it, but I can't escape it<end_line>
Oh baby...<end_line>
Please forgive me..<end_line>
When I think of you, my thoughts are so X-rated<end_line>
Oh baby..<end_line>
Baby, I don't give a damn<end_line>
I know that your man's nowhere in sight, whoa-whoa..<end_line>
And your eyes don't tell a lie<end_line>
I know you wanna come with me, tonight<end_line>
And I say alright, but first you gotta..<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Baby, I..<end_line>
I'm the kinda guy that don't get real excited<end_line>
Oh baby...<end_line>

When you have your private party, I hope that I'm invited<end_line>
Oh baby..<end_line>
Baby, I don't give a damn<end_line>
I know that your man's nowhere in sight<end_line>
And your eyes don't tell a lie<end_line>
I know you wanna come with me, tonight<end_line>
And I say alright, but first you gotta..<end_line>
<verse_end>

Okay, so after you back it up, just stop<end_line>
Now drop it like it's hot, and pop it like a glock<end_line>
And sto it like a watch, now move it like clockwork<end_line>
Ya body is screamin and ya booty is an outburst<end_line>
She wanna do it, do it with no delay<end_line>
I told her I could run it, run it just like relay<end_line>
Yeah, 'cause I'm cool, just like the breeze way<end_line>
And +Push It+ like Salt-N-P-E-P-P-A<end_line>
<verse_end>
