<verse_start>
I get my kush from California, get my dro from Arizona<end_line>
I can get it cross the boarder, I got a Ryda name Winona<end_line>
And I be calmer than a somma, inside of the phantom<end_line>
And it's lookin' like a sauna, and I still stay high and I still got my diploma<end_line>
And I still keep the maggie on me like a Homer<end_line>
And I'm too sick, man, I'm spittin' out a coma<end_line>
And I'm still lettin' the money pile like goma<end_line>
And I smoke that kill, ya'll blowin' on begonias<end_line>
And I keep a fill of that grass like a farmer<end_line>
And I keep that armor, try me and I'll spin you around<end_line>
I'll be with the stars and I ain't talkin' Tinsel Town<end_line>
That's right the present town, bitches tear the fences down<end_line>
Like prince in town, boy I shits a pound of that purple rain on the marvin's day<end_line>
You wit me now? Too high you can't set me down<end_line>
