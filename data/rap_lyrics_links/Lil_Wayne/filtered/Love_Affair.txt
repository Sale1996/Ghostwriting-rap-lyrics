Fatal attraction, ready for action<end_line>
She had a body like Ms. Jackson<end_line>
I knew there was trouble when she passed by<end_line>

I swear that I was done, I'm never goin back<end_line>
Then she called up, she said I left my hat<end_line>
Daaaamn, y'know I can't live without my hat - hah!<end_line>
I got an excuse to double back y'all<end_line>

<verse_start>
Uh, I got a main bitch, and a mistress<end_line>

I ain't a player, but I love a lot<end_line>
She loves me, she loves me not<end_line>
But it feel good, and it's not supposed to<end_line>
I eat her insides - mm~! soul food<end_line>

We stuck in the moment ,like the time froze<end_line>
Then my girl call, back to reality<end_line>
But I keep her in a picture in my heart gallery, oh!<end_line>
