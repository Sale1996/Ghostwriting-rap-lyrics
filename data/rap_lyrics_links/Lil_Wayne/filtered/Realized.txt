Okay, let's cut the crap<end_line>
I'm straight gangsta - forget the rap<end_line>
I only stick with that 'cause my ma don't wan' see me flip the crack<end_line>
And I'm quick to click and spit the gat<end_line>
I be dipped in black<end_line>
Sip the Coke mixed with Jack - Calico, clip to match<end_line>
Like: where them cats who trippin' at? - Point niggas out<end_line>
'cause right now I'm full of that spinach that'll knock Lennox out<end_line>
The Mack-10 is out, as well as the gauge and the pump<end_line>
You turn the page on the newspaper, see my face in the front<end_line>
I lock it down for all my niggas that still caged in the dump<end_line>
So if I come, nigga, just save me a blade and a pump<end_line>
I'm raised in the slum where the bad grow<end_line>
Unlike no other, I'm reallike bag 'Bauds<end_line>
I stash O's in the drawers of my trash hoes<end_line>
I flash dough at the laws when they pass slow<end_line>
I mash low in a stolen hot RAV-4<end_line>
The Macks blow bullet holes for my cash flow<end_line>
Is that so?<end_line>

Which one of these niggas playin' with me?<end_line>
I'ma strap up and slam his parent's street<end_line>
When I blast, bullets spit faster than MC Hammer beats<end_line>
I be damned if he get a chance to sleep<end_line>
I clamp the magazine in my gun and cut his family tree<end_line>
I flash the piece at your lil' woman and make her dance for me<end_line>
Then jam the freak with a broom - blood leak from her panty crease<end_line>
There has to be some explanation for this insanity<end_line>
Yeah, y'all niggas faker than that boy<end_line>
Now give me the dank<end_line>
Niggas claim they want war when I suggest you live in a tank<end_line>
What's your kid gonna think?<end_line>
Come home and find your wig in the sink<end_line>
I dig in the bank, and pull out eighty, then cruise to Haiti<end_line>
For fifty G's I get ten ki's and straight out weight it<end_line>
I lock my area down - you can ask these boys<end_line>
They know Wheezy got more white than the Backstreet Boys<end_line>

I hope y'all niggas understand that I ain't playin' or jokin'<end_line>
Bust shots, make you think the Grand Canyon open<end_line>
Leave a busta bandana smokin' from hot hollows<end_line>
Me and my niggas flip your coke, then cop hot hoes<end_line>
Two pistols, desperado gun busta<end_line>
Pump one under your chest and knock a lung from ya<end_line>
Hung under them killers and duck the pigs<end_line>
And all of our diamonds shine, and our trucks are big<end_line>
And, nigga, I don't really care if I don't sell a million quick<end_line>
'cause right now I'll quit and go and sell a million bricks<end_line>
I sticks to what I love, and that's the street<end_line>
And stay away from what I hate, and that's police<end_line>
And I keep a trigga somewhere on me to start blowin'<end_line>
And leave a nigga somewhere lonely with his heart showin'<end_line>
When we all knowin' that Wheezy have never been fake<end_line>
The metal will spray and let the bullets tear up your face<end_line>
Who is Wheezy, nigga?<end_line>
