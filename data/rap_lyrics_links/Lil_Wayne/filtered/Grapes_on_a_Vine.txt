Momma always said that, it's okay to dream  <end_line>
Momma always warned me things ain't always what they seem<end_line>
People, they will judge you; leave you sittin' on a shelf  <end_line>
Remember it's a long ride, just don't you give up on yourself  <end_line>
And like every man, who wants to make his mark <end_line>
We ALL got a secret hidden in our hearts, yeah <end_line>
People they will judge us, 'cause they just don't really see  <end_line>
We're in it for the long ride, just don't you give up on you and me, no~!<end_line>

Uh, uh<end_line>
Grapes on a vine, ain't nuttin' sweet<end_line>
You gotta pay the price, just keep your receipt<end_line>
I can make the world have a seat on my feet<end_line>
And I come from New Orleans where the water too deep<end_line>
Money bring problems, the funny thang 'bout it<end_line>
Everybody want it, want it 'til they got it<end_line>
Sometimes I forget and put my trouble in my pockets<end_line>
Then hang up my pants, now I got monsters in my closet<end_line>
Get right with me, Miss Wright with me<end_line>
Die hard, I got too much life in me<end_line>
Shades on, I'm seein past that<end_line>
Bittersweet wine, where your glass at?<end_line>
Toast! You haters are ghost<end_line>
I make y'all sick, you need a full dose, ha~!<end_line>
And my momma told me do me<end_line>
and stay away from that fruit tree, because..<end_line>
