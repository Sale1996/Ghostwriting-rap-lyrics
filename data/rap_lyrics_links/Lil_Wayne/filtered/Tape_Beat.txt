Hello honey, I'm home<end_line>
I'm kicking out the weak and the timid niggas<end_line>
They keepin' it pimping, Weezy baby to an infant<end_line>
I'm growing<end_line>
You niggas snoring 'cause you sleep with the fishes<end_line>
You'll be like sheep to a grizzly, put my bare feet on them bitches<end_line>
And I keep a bitch with me, yellow as pee that I spit in<end_line>
I'm a breeze to the finish and I'm a weep when I win it<end_line>
I'm a sleep with the semi and never let people get near me<end_line>
When the reaper come get me that's when I reap what I'm knitting<end_line>
So, you say you're gangsta I'm a need some convincing<end_line>
Blood gang, creme de la creme is the Crimson<end_line>
Fuck the pigs all day, even the guineas<end_line>
Fuck the system, pull out<end_line>
And skeet on the titties<end_line>
It's Lil Tunechi<end_line>
Started from a league now we swimming<end_line>
Put this hot red revolver to your cheek while you're grinning<end_line>
I could cheat Roger Clemens<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Catch a nigga riding deep in your women<end_line>
Beep goes the Jeep so we winning<end_line>
Friendless, compete with no nigga but myself<end_line>
White sand and the beach towels hitting<end_line>
White man let my peeps outta prison<end_line>
I'm just saying what I'm saying<end_line>
But I'm saying, I don't repeat I'm repentant<end_line>
Cut off the hand to hand out a sentence<end_line>
<verse_end>
