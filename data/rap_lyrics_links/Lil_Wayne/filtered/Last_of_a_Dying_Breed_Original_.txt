<verse_start>
I got it baby!<end_line>
And I'm an MC, I move the crowd like Moses<end_line>
Like the Red Sea I wear red like roses<end_line>
Go against me and you'll be dead like roses<end_line>
Spittin at your head full of bread like toasters<end_line>
Never had a holster, I keep it on my lap<end_line>
And hip-hop ain't dead, it just had a heart attack<end_line>
But you see I keep it pumpin, yeah I got that heart back<end_line>
So just call me Little Carter, or Little Cardiac<end_line>
Precious like an artifact, valuable like a quarterback<end_line>
Hannibal like they call me Jack, throwback like a Starter hat<end_line>
Now how did he thought of that? I mean how did he think of that?<end_line>
I mean how did I think of that? Now like a rental, bring it back<end_line>
I mean how did I think of that? I surprise myself sometimes<end_line>
Someone should throw me a surprise party for every rhyme<end_line>
Every time I do it, I do it dirty like swine<end_line>
For the dirty and fine, hip-hop, I'm alive!<end_line>
