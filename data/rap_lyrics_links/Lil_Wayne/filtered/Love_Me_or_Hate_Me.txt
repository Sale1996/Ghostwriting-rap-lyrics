Thank you<end_line>
I've been through it all<end_line>
The fields, the falls, I'm like Niagra<end_line>
But I got right back up like Viagra<end_line>
I am agriculture, swagger's so mean it might insult ya<end_line>
Hah, I'm like an ultra vulture<end_line>
I fuck around and catapult ya<end_line>
Torture! Thought ya, parents taught ya<end_line>
You guys is cho-cha, I'm gone, buenas noches<end_line>
Flow - scorcher, and I don't even write<end_line>
No - author, so - harder, so - smarter<end_line>
All about a dollar like fo' - quarters<end_line>
Oh father, will tonight be my last?<end_line>
And if so, make sure my kids see my cash<end_line>
And I know, I'm silent like an album cast<end_line>
And my future will be better than my past<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
C-A-R-T-E-R<end_line>
I spit movies like a VCR<end_line>
I spit rounds like the Tiki bar<end_line>
And if I got beef I'm the meat cleav-ah<end_line>
And I are, the illest nigga Martin Luther King died for<end_line>
And I ride for, Hollygrove 1-7, Eagle Street<end_line>
And I'm higher than an eagle's feet, but I believe in me<end_line>
Apple is the cross street, I am just an offspring<end_line>
Born in the ghetto, that's why I can't let go<end_line>
One call, I'll have my dogs on ya like an echo<end_line>
Baby I am the real deal, no pickle<end_line>
Uh, I spit single cell psycho<end_line>
I go, off like a motherfucking rifle<end_line>
And I'm from, the underground baby like a pipe hole<end_line>
And I will stand tall like light poles until the light blows<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Share my blood, feed my family<end_line>
My flow will have to plead insanity<end_line>
So sick I need Grey's Anatomy<end_line>
Acid like a bust open battery<end_line>
I'm cool like L.A. nights<end_line>
I'm tight like ballet tights<end_line>
Eight twelves, I swear the other day I pissed Cristal<end_line>
These bitches try to kick it like gentiles<end_line>
I've got to watch my head in the battle<end_line>
I'm just trying to stay ahead of my shadow<end_line>
And I'm floating like a boat and a paddle<end_line>
Alligators and rattlesnakes<end_line>
But I promise I will take a nigga off like a Saturday<end_line>
Got money to validate, I'm icy like carrot cake<end_line>
Different coloured diamonds make me look like a salad plate<end_line>
I'm straight out the alley, wait, it's the nigga ya daddy hate<end_line>
Weezy F. Baby, great!<end_line>
