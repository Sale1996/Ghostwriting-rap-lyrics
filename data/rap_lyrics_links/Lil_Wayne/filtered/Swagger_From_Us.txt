Pull up on the corner, windows down on the space ship<end_line>
Ballin so hard man, I deserve an ace mint award, applaud<end_line>
Like I'm on stage, be married to the money<end_line>
I just skipped the engagement<end_line>
I'm fly, my ally is the bird game<end_line>
The top flew off of my whip, bird brains<end_line>
Third lane in the back of the first lane<end_line>
I need Rihanna's "Umbrella" for this purple rain<end_line>
Hurt to wayne, call it Wayne's World<end_line>
Money money, call 'em Wayne's girls<end_line>
Young money gangstas<end_line>
Runnin this shit like a flanker<end_line>
Ain't a clique like mine<end_line>
We click like 9's<end_line>
And we get higher than six by nines<end_line>
The stove ain't watch, cuz it's my time<end_line>
Bad boom swagger ain't shit like mine<end_line>
