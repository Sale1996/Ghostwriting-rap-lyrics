3L and Wayne, what up<end_line>
Listen, I'm way better than that chump<end_line>
Sorry 'cause I let her get her stuff<end_line>
'Cause she shiftin' with a brother who could never get enough of her<end_line>
I'd go tough for her, could never do enough for her<end_line>
Mad love for her, mad thoughts of her<end_line>
Days and days again<end_line>
And I'm like Rocky, where's my Adrianne<end_line>
Now holler back<end_line>
Sweethearts bounce if you feel me<end_line>
Little women love, little me never get enough<end_line>

Why every time I meet a guy who wants to try<end_line>
To get my mathematics I deny<end_line>
He wants to take me home, he's out of his mind<end_line>
Will I ever meet someone for me<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I, I'm so glad I came across this kind of guy<end_line>
He didn't ask me for my number, I thought why<end_line>
Then when I got the chance and now he's gentle inside<end_line>
Now he's the one that's got me open wide<end_line>
<verse_end>

Mom, I stop to holler, not to bother<end_line>
If you busy I'll wait out for hours<end_line>
I'mma stick my wait out all the way out for hours<end_line>
What you know 'bout bein' hot for hours and not from showers, shh...<end_line>
Not yet though, how 'bout some flowers<end_line>
How 'bout we hop the wild one, knock out some lobster<end_line>
I could make your problems easy , stop jabbin' and slabbin'<end_line>
Weezy never get enough<end_line>
<verse_end>
