Ay, let me slide in the Benz with the fished-out fins<end_line>
Hit the mall wit my girlfriends dish out ends<end_line>
Cause you know it ain't trickin if you got it<end_line>
Copped baby girl what she desired <end_line>
It's chump change ma, marijuana scholar <end_line>
Know'n what I got up in my styrafoam cup - that purple stuff<end_line>
It was given to me at birth to stun<end_line>
So that's why I cop the Bentley with the leather and the furry cups<end_line>

It's Lil' Whodi from the Hot Block where seris flow<end_line>
Gotta get dough, cha'll won't feel me broke<end_line>
But, y'all don't hear me though<end_line>
Til I'm rolling down my window where my grill is show<end_line>
And you know I probably pump it through the hood on them 24's<end_line>
Word, rims poking out the side of the err<end_line>
Glock, have ya ribs poking out the side of your shirt <end_line>
I'm a 17 nigga and I ride through the turf<end_line>

Hey, and my pinky glow cause my rings is so...<end_line>
Blingy blingy, yo stop blinking though<end_line>
We smoke stinky stinky dro<end_line>
And we don't cop them incy wincy o's<end_line>
And we don't stop, nah, we blow<end_line>
Fuck the pee-ple<end_line>
