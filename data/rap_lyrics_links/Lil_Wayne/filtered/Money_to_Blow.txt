<verse_start>
When I get paid every twenty-fo', hours, money and the power<end_line>
Come to V.I.P. and get a champagne shower<end_line>
I don't have to worry because everythang ours<end_line>
and I got a big bouquet of Mary Jane's flowers<end_line>
That kush; I promise that's my dude<end_line>
but we don't smoke that Reggie Bush<end_line>
And I'm with two women, make you take a second look<end_line>
We poppin like champagne bottles but we never shook<end_line>
and we go be alright if we put Drake on every hook<end_line>
