<verse_start>
Ridin' around like Pablo, still talkin' that blanco<end_line>
My Nina sing soprano so we gon' leave on a high note<end_line>
Come out my shell like Raphael, and crack yours like a taco<end_line>
Lil Wayne tougher than John Wayne, make him change his name to John Doe<end_line>
It's me and my lil brother Capo, Lil Marley G and my bottom bitch<end_line>
If I'm fallin', it's bottomless; if I'm trippin', it's a power trip<end_line>
Her pearl tongue like the pearly gates and with that said, I climb the fence<end_line>
My other bitches gotta ride the bench and with that said - bitch you jealous<end_line>
I'm fly like my dreadlocks propellers, I think I should headline Coachella<end_line>
My woman a queen like Coretta and nigga, you sleep with the Devil<end_line>
I couldn't be Jr. forever, I don't mean to ruffle your feathers<end_line>
But I had to spread my wings, ain't trying to get lemon peppered<end_line>
Got too many pistols, too many issues, too many mistakes, too many miscues<end_line>
Only made me better, it turned me into the man I am today, I'm new and I'm improved<end_line>
I got my shit right, it's just you and a tissue, suit yourself because this suit is a rental<end_line>
Now the snow is just comin' in like I broke a window to an igloo<end_line>
Slow a bitch down like un momento, I'd rather get screwed than scrutinized<end_line>
I'd rather get used by a cutie pie; if she ain't fuckin', it's uber time<end_line>
I rather be advised than supervised, you do the math, we do the numbers<end_line>
We pour champagne and expensive wine in water guns and shoot each other, uh<end_line>
I get high, meditate like a monk, preposterous when I get drunk<end_line>
And my goons is wilder than Gronk, my do's is as bad as my don'ts<end_line>
Met a kinda-cute bitch with a donk as long as the bitch got a donk<end_line>
And I smell like pussy, money and weed, she said "Ooh, I like your cologne"<end_line>
The last niggas tested us flunk so please study hard, study long<end_line>
Kill your wife then take the bitch phone and text you to please hurry home<end_line>
And the rain drops turn into blood, look like you just come in from a storm<end_line>
And if all pussies come with walls, I hope you run into your own<end_line>
Nigga I come with that heroin flow, I come with that never before<end_line>
My CMB days are dead, I ain't worried 'bout ghost, I married the MOB, we divorced<end_line>
Woo! And all that shit dead with out me of course it's nothin', a zombie, a corpse<end_line>
You burnt yourself and was suppose to pass me the torch; fuck it, I'll see you in Forbes nigga<end_line>
... I'm sorry for the fuckin' wait<end_line>
Was busy, searchin' my calender for better days<end_line>
I found 'em - you either turn the page or tear the page<end_line>
Y. M., Young Money, never age<end_line>
