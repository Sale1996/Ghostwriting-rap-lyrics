<verse_start>
When I was 16 I bought my first Mercedes-Benz<end_line>
I must'a fucked a thousand bitches and her girlfriends<end_line>
White leather, hot new pair of rims<end_line>
Brand new pistol with a trigger like a hair-pin<end_line>
Big work, we don't need a scale man<end_line>
Big paper, say good-morning to the mail-man<end_line>
What'chu know 'bout puttin bricks in the spare, man?<end_line>
I can stuff a coupe, like a motherfuckin Caravan<end_line>
I'm in my zone, my farm is so rare man<end_line>
If there's a throne, you lookin at the chair-man<end_line>
How you want it? Show me my opponent<end_line>
=====Eats some chips, says next line with mouth full=====<end_line>
Throw me my opponent<end_line>
I'm still ballin, a bullet gotta get me<end_line>
And I never been a pussy, cause my hood'll never let me<end_line>
A made nigga, got made niggas with me<end_line>
I'm a motorcycle boy, so I'm bout to park a Bentley<end_line>
