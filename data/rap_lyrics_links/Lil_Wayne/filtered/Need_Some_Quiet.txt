I get, I get<end_line>
I, I, I get so deep in that pussy, I touch the back of your soul<end_line>
You gotta man, I bet I can make you pack up and roll<end_line>
Yea, let's ride like we attached to the road<end_line>
And if we on the same track, I hope we crash and explode<end_line>
Yea, where do the passionate go<end_line>
I beat it up forever, girl I'll take a national oath<end_line>
Nobody know what goes on the latch on the door<end_line>
And if you throw it to me baby, I will catch it and score<end_line>
Yea, yea<end_line>
I beat that, I be right when she call me, she got that shit I just can't avoid<end_line>
She so addictive and she know that I do anything that she tell me<end_line>
I am her personal sex toy<end_line>
And then, I pop the bottle of that cris<end_line>
I had a glass, she had a glass, I had a glass, she had a glass, again<end_line>
Ya know, then she was ready got to it<end_line>
One time, two times, hit me up and I take that ass again<end_line>
And I told her<end_line>

You blow my brains out, I blow ya back out<end_line>
Now what is that about<end_line>
You got me sweatin you so hard, I'm bout to pass out<end_line>
And we could do it on the beach, in the grass house<end_line>
Say, we could do it on the beach, in my glass house<end_line>

Hop on it until it's foamin, I bone it better than homie<end_line>
I want it better than homie, come get on this pony<end_line>

Give ya couple of thigh bites, then here comes the highlight<end_line>

Take a ten minute break, then get back right<end_line>
And then I told her<end_line>

She said these is Donna Karen<end_line>
So tight, she can't even let air in<end_line>
Man I swear I saw a blind man starin<end_line>
No lie, and I hope she take her clothes off<end_line>
So we can do it, 'til we doze off<end_line>
We fall asleep with our clothes off<end_line>
When we wake up, we pick up where we left off<end_line>
And then I tell her<end_line>
<verse_end>
