Runnin' from the scene, Hammer in my jeans<end_line>
Dead bodies behind me, the cops'll never find me<end_line>
Arm & Hammer Clean on my way to the honeycombe<end_line>
Hustle all night tell my bitch I'm never coming home<end_line>
Be there in the morning, stop cryin' bitch<end_line>
The sun is home, drop it on the living room table<end_line>
Bitch the money home, I know you ain't gon' stay once the money gone<end_line>
So while I'm rich I pull my dick and get my fuckin' on<end_line>
Youngin' on some real "Gangsta Gangsta" shit<end_line>
Blame it on the neighborhood I was sanctioned in<end_line>
But I'ma make sure we get them acres<end_line>
Tell 'em fuck computers, we good with paper<end_line>
Tell 'em fuck the world 'cause I'm hood by nature<end_line>
Feelin' that way is how the hood'll make ya<end_line>
The hood is vacant, the streets are empty, yeah<end_line>
Mr. Bush, rebuild the city, but<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Yeah, over like yesterday floatin' to the floodgates<end_line>
This is New Orleans, welcome to the blood state<end_line>
A blood bath, and you ain't nothin' but tub bait<end_line>
No political justice not even the judge safe<end_line>
If his ass can't swim he get a closed case<end_line>
We need our own space, I ain't talkin' about Jupiter<end_line>
No luck, no help and we the fuckin' future<end_line>
I'm a hoosier, usually the cool one<end_line>
But when I need it, I turn into a looter<end_line>
God forgive, but do he forgive the brutal<end_line>
Even when it's for the better of your junior<end_line>
Soon you see that life's just another movie<end_line>
And the main character dies at the end, usually<end_line>
There's nothin' that haven't been done that you can do to me<end_line>
I been hit, I been shot nigga shoot at me!<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Yeah, Money on the mind, murder in the plans<end_line>
Disturbin' if you may, but it's dinner for the fam<end_line>
Hustler by law, support when I can<end_line>
Hustle when I can, tell me nothing I'm a man<end_line>
Smell my shit as I walk off the stand<end_line>
Nuts to my feet with my heart in my hand<end_line>
Pardon my G, but I'm one of a kind<end_line>
Been shot two times, here to put it in a rhyme<end_line>
Slow lane, move the Coupe like a 5<end_line>
If I get pulled over, bitch I'm gon' do time<end_line>
And I know my niggaz love me, but they can't do mine<end_line>
So I gotta be smart, get bread or get behind<end_line>
Get lost or get in line<end_line>
But the carpet's still fine<end_line>
So keep tryin', the whole world turnin' back<end_line>
But we keep tryin' until we get our piece, no piece<end_line>
Keep Firin'<end_line>
