Figured it's time that I step back from the game<end_line>
And peep it from a coach's point of view<end_line>
So I can see how niggas went wrong and how the players was wrong<end_line>
And I can do it how a pro supposed to do<end_line>
No mistakes allowed, you get caskets for that shit<end_line>
The line of scrimmage is waiting<end_line>
Niggas is blitzing, you could get sacked quick<end_line>
Drop back like an all star QB<end_line>
Or the top on that high-end sports car with two seats<end_line>
You niggas don't comb the pages of the duPont Registry<end_line>
Looking for vehicles and accessories<end_line>
Like I do, and every representor of my crew<end_line>
I get love from cuz and the Pyru<end_line>
Slide through the drive through of a fast food restaurant<end_line>
Turn the music down and tell the broad what kind of sauce I want<end_line>
Scratch off quickly to a main street, intentions to make cheese<end_line>
Let the windows down and let the purp sing perfectly<end_line>
The police is peeping me and they don't think that I can see<end_line>
I know they gon' pull me over and make me get out<end_line>
But I'm onto 'em, spray the crime<end_line>
Then kill it and talk calm to 'em<end_line>
Good day officer, what's the problem?<end_line>
You looking for answers? I don't got none<end_line>
I'm from New Orleans and New Orleans don't raise no rats<end_line>
You know the consequences of your acts, I'm getting money nigga<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
You can see me on the eastside of New Orleans with a red bitch<end_line>
Fuck the world, make you walk with a leg twitch<end_line>
Flow retarded, I'm on some special ed shit<end_line>
The magnificent, twist it like a dread bitch<end_line>
And I can get up in the car and drive<end_line>
And if the record is a smash I can still survive<end_line>
Yeah, money ain't a thang but everythang to me<end_line>
Shit I gotta make 'em see no sang to me<end_line>
Yeah, higher than all of the angels be<end_line>
And, no I never choke but I strangle beats<end_line>
And, I am just a player in this game we be<end_line>
So go blame the referee, don't complain to me<end_line>
And I used to have a cutlass on stainless feet<end_line>
Passing all day up Latoya Street<end_line>
Back when Scarface used to sang to me<end_line>
Had me feeling like a G was the thang to be<end_line>
Back when I was peddling my ten-speed bike<end_line>
Who knew I'd be peddling the six-speed white?<end_line>
Big dog through the door where the little dogs bite<end_line>
So if you are female dog, you don't fight<end_line>
Bitch ass nigga, I ain't got no master<end_line>
Rich ass nigga, I got all my masters<end_line>
Bitch ass nigga, I ain't got no master<end_line>
Rich ass nigga...<end_line>
<verse_end>
