Bought a Benz for my baddest bitch<end_line>
And let my niggas drive that motherfucker<end_line>
I swear that court won't commendamize a motherfucker<end_line>
Pray for us cause we be in and out that mothafucker<end_line>
Lord, help us Lord, my bitch is beautiful, Helen of Troy<end_line>
Just like assume I get ass from a star<end_line>
I flip the script when they cast for the part<end_line>
You ain't talking to me if you ain't talking money my nigga<end_line>
Strength in numbers my nigga<end_line>
And I'm number one like my muscles got bigger<end_line>
Like my puzzles got figured<end_line>
I spoil my kids, they so stubborn, my nigga<end_line>
This is how shit is supposed to be, dawg<end_line>
Rollie on my wrist and around my neck<end_line>
I got a chain of command and a food chain on<end_line>
Shoutout my dog lookin' at the four walls<end_line>
Shoutout Candace for acceptin' my calls<end_line>
Impossible ain't impossible at all<end_line>
