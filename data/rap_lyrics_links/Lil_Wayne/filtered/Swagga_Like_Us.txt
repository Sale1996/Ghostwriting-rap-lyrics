<verse_start>
No one on the corner has swagger like moi<end_line>
Church, but I'm too clean for the choir<end_line>
I require, what I desire<end_line>
I got stripes, A-di-das<end_line>
Mamis scream, "¡Papi no más!"<end_line>
Run up in your shit, just me, no Moss<end_line>
Runnin this shit like I got fo' thighs<end_line>
No one has swagger like these fo' guys<end_line>
Now when it comes to styles, I got several<end_line>
Sharper than the swag or dagger all metal<end_line>
And my jew-els, blue and yellow<end_line>
The type of shit that make 'em call you Carmelo<end_line>
Rules as follows stay true to the ghetto<end_line>
Write your name on the bullet make you feel special<end_line>
Ha! What the fuck you boys talkin 'bout?<end_line>
I know it's us cause we the only thing to talk about<end_line>
And I'm gone... bye<end_line>
