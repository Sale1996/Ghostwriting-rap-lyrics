I'm on my grind, fuck bitches money on my mind<end_line>
Hoe get in line, respect me like a stop sign<end_line>
I'm in my prime, the brights you see it's my time<end_line>
But fuck my wrists I need that money in my palm<end_line>
Sellin palm trees, in beaches in shorts sleeves<end_line>
Fly your beach down here bet ya she won't leave<end_line>
Exspensive car keys and glasses, t-shirts, pants's<end_line>
I keep money on me like dancers, Si<end_line>
Everybody got problems, and money is the answer<end_line>
The teacher ain't pickin everybody with they hands up<end_line>
What are we to do but get paid, get ya grass up<end_line>
Number one fan of the money, join the fan club<end_line>
These boys don't know paper like I know paper,<end_line>
Nigga I'm still on 2004 paper, I'm tryin to get some more paper<end_line>
I ain't tryin to die with no paper, that's why a nigga stay....<end_line>
