My niggas been stuntin' since way back when<end_line>
CNN, I got news for you haters<end_line>
I'm a nasty ass nigga, ask your bitch, I ain't lyin'<end_line>
69, that's a favor for a favor<end_line>
Them hoes bitin' they lip, cause when I say shit like that, she feel some type of way<end_line>
I hit it from the front, from the side, from the back, I hit it all type of ways<end_line>
She throw it at me like I'm just one strike away<end_line>
Sometimes life is hard to swallow but she like to taste<end_line>
Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding, my lawyer fight the case<end_line>
I got them flowers in me, I feel like a vase<end_line>
Monsters in my closet, no more closet space<end_line>
Niggas want to be this fly, too many flights to take<end_line>
Enough with the small talk, my girl pussy is a waterpark<end_line>
Every little thing I do turn her on -- that's autostart<end_line>
I kiss every single body part, her body is a work of art<end_line>
I'm way too high, her skirt too short, I think I love her, it was just a thought<end_line>
I pop up in that coupe 'bout to go back to the future<end_line>
And she said "Tune, not in my mouth" damn, you should've said it sooner<end_line>
I be shittin' on these niggas like I'm sippin' Metamucil<end_line>
And we smokin' on that gas, pass it like "excuse you"<end_line>
And it's, 6-6-2's Piru all day my nigga<end_line>
Before these niggas play with us, they'll play dead my nigga<end_line>
And if you lookin' for me, I'll be on these bitches' mind<end_line>
These niggas chicken and I've never seen a chicken fly<end_line>

<verse_start>
My bitch been fussin' at me about nothin'<end_line>
Ain't no tellin' what she'd do if I replace her<end_line>
Like bae, I'm straight, there's plenty fish and I'm bait<end_line>
We can't even have a decent conversation<end_line>
I pop the seal on my sip, and she be like "See you gon' drink your life away"<end_line>
Bitch it's +My Life+, +My Life+, +My Life+, shout out Mary J.<end_line>
And tell them boys that beef tastes like a slice of cake<end_line>
And old folks get shot too, they write down license plates<end_line>
I hope that hoe don't call sayin' her cycle late<end_line>
All this fuckin' gotta stop but I need tighter brakes<end_line>
And don't run from this dick girl, I don't like to chase<end_line>
I wax that ass, she make that Mr. Miyagi face<end_line>
And she ain't all that pretty but I like her shape<end_line>
They say numbers don't lie, she shaped like a eight<end_line>
She say she ain't no dyke but she gon' dyke today<end_line>
It's curtains for these niggas, I feel like some drapes<end_line>
We turnt up niggas, burnt up, stop the microwave<end_line>
This shit might cost us our life but that's the price we pay<end_line>
I'm hotter than the peppers Peter Piper ate<end_line>
This that Dedication 5, whattup five? Uhh<end_line>
