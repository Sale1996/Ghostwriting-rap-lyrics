Look, my bitch is on Tumblr, your bitch need a tummy tuck<end_line>
Since Jesus of Nazareth, the realest you've come across<end_line>
I be with killers just coming home<end_line>
They only hope is me and the Quran<end_line>
They only wish is for a new chain<end_line>
But they stuck up in the ankle bracelet<end_line>
I get the money stacked, see the moon's where it's sunny at<end_line>
And I move where the realest be<end_line>
And the quickest, see baby, you gettin' lapped<end_line>
Yeah, the DMV on the map<end_line>
That's a city, two states if you can count<end_line>
I'm as real as I say, I never lie<end_line>
So whenever I go, know I'm runnin' back<end_line>

Bitches want money stacks, I just want my percent<end_line>
She told me to hit the hole, I used to play running back<end_line>
You niggas be fumbling, don't you give 'em no gun again<end_line>
These bitches be flying out, yeah, 'cause money be coming in<end_line>

She bounce it like jumping jacks, but she got a funny ass<end_line>
Look what them booty shots done to that<end_line>
That bitch need her money back, Lord<end_line>
She like the finer things, she said I sent her a diamond ring<end_line>
She say I buy her all kinds of things<end_line>
She lie about everything<end_line>
I put her on time out and everything<end_line>
I cut the bitch off like a thread of string<end_line>
These hoes'll say about anything<end_line>
'Cause they know that y'all believe everything<end_line>
That's why I get high about every day<end_line>
All of this fog like the weather change<end_line>
Turn the strip club to a hurricane<end_line>
We got that cocaine, snow flurry gang<end_line>
And we do not play games 'bout money, mane<end_line>
She do something strange for money, mane<end_line>
Yeah, I used to play running back<end_line>
I turned that football to a money bag, I'm gone<end_line>
