Hah~! It go oooooh, girl, I love you so<end_line>
But I put money way above you though<end_line>
Nasty by nature, human vibrator<end_line>
Just hope that I don't spit you out as soon as I taste ya<end_line>
I'm cool as lemonade at a sunday picnic<end_line>
I'll break your girl off and you are not Mr. Fix-it<end_line>
Huh, so she called me to make it juicy for her<end_line>
And I'ma beat it, like I produced it for her<end_line>
Hot as Lucifer, make that thing right juicy for us<end_line>
Gimme 'bout a week I'ma have a prostitute named Boostin for us<end_line>
So many women be like "Weezy please seduce it for us"<end_line>
Then after I do they be like "Please play that acoustic for us"<end_line>
Ha ha! I'm an undercover lover<end_line>
And if she backed up I am Joseph the Plumber<end_line>
Hehehe, you can find it on me<end_line>
And since she love my teardrops she be windin on meee<end_line>
