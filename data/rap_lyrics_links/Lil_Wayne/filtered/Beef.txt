<verse_start>
Let's go, nigga<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
You liable to catch me speedin' up the six, or beatin' up a chick<end_line>
or standin' over a stove, sweatin', heatin' up a brick<end_line>
And we keep the hustlin' slick, and got clips like bananas<end_line>
We twist the bandanas, and spit at niggas with cannons<end_line>
We ran in habitats with masks and plastic gats<end_line>
Stormin' through the house, screamin', "Where's this bastard's crack?!!"<end_line>
I flash the mack in front of your gal and make her tell<end_line>
Like, "Slut! Where's the yay, or I'ma pop one in your grill!"<end_line>
It's Lil Wayne, nigga - blast and bang triggas<end_line>
Pay with my change, then I'm gon' have to bang niggas<end_line>
I bag the caine quicker, and sprinkle like rain, nigga<end_line>
Flood the av quick with the quarters and halves, nigga<end_line>
If you out, you can find me on the street with the work<end_line>
If it's a drought, you can find me on the street with the work<end_line>
Never slip - I empty half a clip deep in your shirt<end_line>
And put your whole clique deep in the dirt<end_line>
Smell me?<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I'm the youngest Hot Boy on the field with heaters<end_line>
Let my nine-millimeters kill your peoples<end_line>
Bust up in your house and put the gun to lil' Renita<end_line>
Give me the yay, or else I'ma put her in her sneakers<end_line>
Wowyou can catch me in all black with no smile<end_line>
Me, Turk, Geezy, and 'Nile - chicka-POW!<end_line>
How come these niggaz keep burnin the world?<end_line>
and why the hell this nigga Wheezy keep firmin your girl?<end_line>
Turnin the wheel on the orange and teal Bentley drop<end_line>
Then I'ma put that up and hop in the van and hit your block<end_line>
Tell your mom to get the cops cause y'all gon' need 'em<end_line>
When you see them bullets that my glock pop, y'all gon' eat 'em<end_line>
See this for all my niggaz in the pen, I hope for freedom<end_line>
And this for all my niggaz buyin bricks, I got 'em cheaper<end_line>
Keep a nigga quiet as a mouse when I come<end_line>
Wayne #1 Hot Boy, hot as the sun - ya smell me?<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Who wan' beef with 'em?<end_line>
Who wan' creep with 'em?<end_line>
'cause when it comes down to guns, nigga, I sleep with 'em<end_line>
See, we can sweep with 'em 'cause it get deep with 'em<end_line>
And when it comes down to drugs, I'm on the streets with 'em<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Nasty case, nigga run up in your crib, crash the place<end_line>
Mask the face, automatic attach to waist<end_line>
You bastards play?  Then it get awful and bad<end_line>
There will be no more walkin for dad, and it's off with your head<end_line>
And they gon' either get it right, or they get it at night<end_line>
And when they spit, it lick his ass twice like 20 damn dice<end_line>
Henny and ice is what I prefer, but light on the rocks<end_line>
I pack them clips tight on them glocks and light up your block<end_line>
And if there's coke involved, then your throat's involved<end_line>
I get the toaster and roll up and smoke most of y'all<end_line>
Me and my nigga, Super Sosa, run up in your crib<end_line>
while your grandma watchin Oprah, jag her up and rope her<end_line>
If you wan' grudge, chances slim like Ethiopia<end_line>
If you want drugs, I got more flavors than Fruitopia<end_line>
Recognize it's real and nuttin udder than that<end_line>
Cause one from the mac'll have blood coverin your back, ha?<end_line>
<verse_end>
