<verse_start>
If I don't do nothin', I'ma stunt my ass off<end_line>
Money sittin' in the pocket, 'bout to get a passoff<end_line>
And I smoke that shit that smell like when you take your cast off<end_line>
And I got them beach bitches, like David Hasselhoff<end_line>
Baby I'm an acrobat. Sweetie, I'm a stuntdevil<end_line>
You can't get on my level 'cause I am so unleveled<end_line>
I'm a young rebel<end_line>
And I got a babyface<end_line>
I need a young Pebbles<end_line>
I need a stuntdouble<end_line>
Me, Drake and Kid and you know it's trouble<end_line>
We got 'em drownin' in the flow, you see 'em blowin' bubbles<end_line>
I stick my landin' in a freak drawers<end_line>
I'll have her bouncin' back like Dominique Dawes<end_line>
But I ain't stuntin' these hoes<end_line>
I been pimpin' since Hulk Hogan was N.W.O<end_line>
I'm wild, Drizzy tough, and the Kid vicious<end_line>
The three horseman, we just need Sid Vicious<end_line>
I'm on the cup of that tilt<end_line>
And if you hatin' on me<end_line>
I'll say fuck you like Wilt<end_line>
Im a wild-erbeast. You're just a wilderbeast<end_line>
My two fingers make a gun, that shoot and kill ya peace<end_line>
Talkin' big big shit<end_line>
I am rude<end_line>
I take food<end_line>
From a kid picnic<end_line>
And we can bang like bumper cars<end_line>
You know I stunt shit 'cause I write all Stunna bars<end_line>
