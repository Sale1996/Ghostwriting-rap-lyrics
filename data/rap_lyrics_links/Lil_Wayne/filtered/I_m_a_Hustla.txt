<verse_start>
I'm a southern boy, therefore I stunt<end_line>
Y'all city slickers, we call it country dump<end_line>
And I'm chilling like a villain off a killing<end_line>
Looking at the ceilings like I'ma get in for realer<end_line>
I'ma get it regardless, hard as it is<end_line>
Who wants to be a millionaire? Know how I'ma get a million<end_line>
And I'm in the pavilion<end_line>
Chilling with my girl but I don't speak Sicilian<end_line>
But we both count the same as<end_line>
Long as when I say I'm with it, it come out the same as<end_line>
If I wanna win with it but I'm out the game<end_line>
Y'all boys trynna get me killed... huh<end_line>
You know the Feds are my biggest fans<end_line>
I got to watch what the little one's saying, man<end_line>
They see my momma and they wanna pull her over<end_line>
Cause she ain't got no number on the back of the Rover<end_line>
And yep - I'm locing<end_line>
There's cooler ways to die but I'm smoking<end_line>
There's cooler ways to ride but I'm soaring<end_line>
Might do the young G5 or G4<end_line>
Ay, you never know, when your boy might touring<end_line>
Just trynna get me some air on Mike Jordan<end_line>
Of this whole thing right here, I'm staring<end_line>
Y'all boys just appear, I'm here, the Tardis<end_line>
So applaud him, yeeeeah<end_line>
Chinky eyes, keep faring<end_line>
Look like Keith Moorer, street aura, uh<end_line>
Still I hustled in the street like he poorer<end_line>
Run up on him you sleep and eat aura<end_line>
Decent Christians, he owes momma, those<end_line>
Gucci seatbelts will look better with the barker<end_line>
Sit up in my office, you need to rebound<end_line>
You got a box out, get up put a baller on<end_line>
I'm right back with ya, never leave ya lonely<end_line>
Forget about Frank momma, I can be your Tony<end_line>
Weezy F. Baby man...<end_line>
