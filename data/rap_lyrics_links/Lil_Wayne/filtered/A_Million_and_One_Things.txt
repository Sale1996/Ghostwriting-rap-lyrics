This.. this here's real, nigga<end_line>
It's real, nigga<end_line>
Too real<end_line>
Pay attention even though I'm young, nigga<end_line>
Look, look<end_line>
This one here's on tha up, dog<end_line>
For all my people with bad luck, dog<end_line>
Strugglin', tryin' ta make a buck, dog<end_line>
For all tha peeps who ain't with us, dog<end_line>
For all my niggas in Angola, stay tough, dog<end_line>
See, this from shorty on tha real<end_line>
I'm tired of seein' my niggas gettin' killed<end_line>
They hustlin' for a mil, nigga, hustle for your bills<end_line>
If ya think ya need help, holla at me, wodie, I'm trill<end_line>
If I got it ta spend, then I got it to give<end_line>
But listen, man.. I know ya see the ice glistenin', man<end_line>
I know it make you wanna go get it bad<end_line>
But ya gotta think 'fore ya move, partna<end_line>
'Cause it'll make your ship sink and you will lose, partna<end_line>
I know you hate ta take it from a young nigga like me<end_line>
But I betcha can't name one nigga like me<end_line>
That's why I'm tryin' ta preach, my nigga<end_line>
And teach, my nigga<end_line>
If ya don't work ya don't eat, my nigga<end_line>
