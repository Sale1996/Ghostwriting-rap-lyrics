Say, who's that peekin' in my window?<end_line>
Is that sunshine? Is that one time?<end_line>
Let that sun shine through my living room<end_line>
Hospitality is what I'm giving you<end_line>
Harsh reality is what I've been through<end_line>
But I'm not alone, ask her and him too<end_line>
And they shall tell ya, ain't nothin' better<end_line>
Than the smell of a new day<end_line>
I know the ocean runs dry and the sky gets dark<end_line>
And ya don't see what He's trying to show ya<end_line>
And I know the wall may seem tall<end_line>
But if we help each other I guarantee we get over<end_line>
And once I'm over, I'll reach back for my brother<end_line>
And pull him over as well<end_line>
Keep our heads high and our noses wide open<end_line>
Hopin' for that new day smell - love live life<end_line>
