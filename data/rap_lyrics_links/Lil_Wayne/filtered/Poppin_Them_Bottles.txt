When it comes to the bread, I got the keys to the bakery<end_line>
These niggas out here trippin, sellin ki's to them agencies<end_line>
My bitch keep saying that the judge got a date for me<end_line>
I tell the silly bitch and ya honor, they can wait for me<end_line>
I'm gone in the coupe with the roof steady chasing me<end_line>
Shine so hard like the fucking sun facing me, basically<end_line>
Take it how you take it, I be making you be hating me<end_line>
Loving me but hating me, hoe you got to pay for me<end_line>
Riding in the big boys, sitting on them grown folks<end_line>
Every time I park, it's a motherfucking car show<end_line>
I guess I'm the number one Lakers fan<end_line>
Yellow bottle, yellow bottle, purple bag, purple bag<end_line>
