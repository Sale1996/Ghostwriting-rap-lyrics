<verse_start>
I ain't terrified from nuthin'<end_line>
I'm young wild crazy and disgustin'<end_line>
Better watch me cuz I'm coming <end_line>
With a oven by my stomach<end_line>
I'm scramblin' for the money<end_line>
Tape ya up like a mummy<end_line>
Call ya people and tell 'em<end_line>
I need 50 for this dummy<end_line>
I'm runnin' hidin' and duckin'<end_line>
Stuntin' ridin' and thuggin<end_line>
Dumpin' fire and bustin'<end_line>
Lovin, lyin' and lustin'<end_line>
Stealin' killin' and rapin<end_line>
Runnin' climbin and chasin<end_line>
Strugglin hustin' to make<end_line>
Get it got it I take it<end_line>
Watch ya Chevy mister<end_line>
Move ya purse miss<end_line>
Cuz I tote heavy pistols<end_line>
And man they burst quick<end_line>
It's too late to hesitate<end_line>
I was told there'd be better days<end_line>
But shit that was yesterday<end_line>
And still I haven't ate<end_line>
But dog that's how ya labor when ya bein' a thug<end_line>
These niggas don't seem to feel me till they seein' they blood<end_line>
Can't hide it though<end_line>
I represent the 17th Carrollton Hollygrove<end_line>
That's my G-code<end_line>

Chorus x 2<end_line>
