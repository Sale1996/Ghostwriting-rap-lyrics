Love is nice when it's understood<end_line>
Even nicer when it makes you feel good<end_line>
You got me trippin' why I love you so<end_line>
Come on baby, let the good times roll<end_line>
Come on baby, let the good times roll<end_line>
Come on baby, let the good times roll<end_line>
Come on baby, let the good times roll<end_line>
Come on baby, let the good times roll<end_line>

It's like Woodstock city, brand new Dylan<end_line>
Bob to the music, sucker than a<end_line>
My heart beat acoustic, moves like Hendrix<end_line>
Walk through a fire, then I flame and kiss it<end_line>
Go hard in my Lambo, strikes and a blizzard<end_line>
2 million in the frame, gotta roll with the vision<end_line>
Vision of a good time, all I wanna know<end_line>
When the party gon' stop, let the good times roll<end_line>
Come on let's go, you got another minute<end_line>
Get the party on the roll, ain't nothing like the feeling<end_line>
When you're winning in your soul<end_line>
The wheel keep spinning, only got one road<end_line>
Stop, stop the show, and stop, stop the flow<end_line>
The world ain't ready cause I rock the globe<end_line>
So act like you know, act like you know<end_line>
Act like you know, just what to do<end_line>
When the good times roll<end_line>

Hey, Flo I got you!<end_line>
Yeah yeah!<end_line>
Take your, take your clothes off<end_line>
Ride that, I drove off<end_line>
Highway to heaven I'll burn the bridge<end_line>
Red bandana, blood, sweat and tears<end_line>
Yeah, it's Tunechi, Tunechi<end_line>
With a capital crucifix, hahaha!<end_line>
Baby let the good times roll like my weed<end_line>
Sticks on my skateboard, and up my sleeves<end_line>
YMCMB Truk everything else<end_line>
So many whips, my garage got whelps<end_line>
Now put your motherfuckin' hands in the air<end_line>
And my throne is an electric chair<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
And let's go all night, all night<end_line>
Wake up the club and let's go all out, all out<end_line>
More drinks for us, toast to the good times<end_line>
May they last forever, we're young, to the good times<end_line>
Raise your glass, let's all have some fun<end_line>
<verse_end>

Come on baby, let the good times roll...<end_line>
