<verse_start>
I got problems bigger than these boys<end_line>
My deposits, they be on steroids<end_line>
Lord, free the Carter, nigga me the Carter<end_line>
Sacrificin' everything, I feel like Jesus Carter<end_line>
Hold up, I got this sewed up, my soda poured up<end_line>
My woes up, I'm flippin' those bucks, they've been with toe tucks<end_line>
I rolled up and let the smoke puff<end_line>
I lay down, told yah<end_line>
Hold up, get too choked up and I think of old stuff<end_line>
Move on, put my goons on, they kidnap newborns<end_line>
In the streets my face a coupon<end_line>
Her pussy too warm<end_line>
All these niggas come to do harm<end_line>
Just bought a new charm<end_line>
The watch, I buy a new arm, you lukewarm<end_line>
I'm Uncle Luke with the hoes<end_line>
Pretty bitches, centerfolds<end_line>
Tippy toes around my crib in their robes, just their robes<end_line>
Half a milli' in the safe, another in the pillowcase<end_line>
Codeine got me movin' slower than a caterpillar race<end_line>
Fuck is wrong with you? What you thinkin'?<end_line>
Fuck you thought it was?<end_line>
I need Popeye percocets and on the Carter buzz<end_line>
And if that label try to stop me<end_line>
There gon' be some crazy Weezy fans waitin' in the lobby<end_line>
Mula, baby<end_line>
