<verse_start>
To you forever, from me to you<end_line>
I heard somebody say "Chuuch!" I'ma need a suit<end_line>
I'ma need a Coupe, I won't need a roof<end_line>
Flyer then Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice<end_line>
I got the flow, I'm tryna see the roof<end_line>
Didn't wear a buttletproof, so I got shot and you can see the proof<end_line>
Blind eyes could look at me and see the truth<end_line>
Wonder if Stevie do? But I'ma leave it to<end_line>
God, not Beaver, neither you<end_line>
Cause I'ma murder Y, kill O and even U<end_line>
Man, I got Summer hatin' on me cause I'm hotter then the Sun<end_line>
Got Spring hatin' on me cause I ain't never sprung<end_line>
Winter hatin' on me cause I'm colder than ya'll<end_line>
And I would never, I would never, I would never fall<end_line>
I'm being hated by the seasons<end_line>
So fuck ya'll who hatin' for no reason<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I been in and out the bank bitch<end_line>
While ya'll asshole niggas been on the same shit<end_line>
I flush 'em, and watch 'em go down the drain quick<end_line>
Two words you never hear "Wayne Quit!"<end_line>
Cause Wayne win, and they lose<end_line>
I call 'em April babies, cause they fools<end_line>
And when they snooze, We up!<end_line>
Feet up like a, Parap-liguck<end_line>
Or, paraplegic? I parallel park<end_line>
In that red and yellow thing, old school Atlanta Hawk<end_line>
Like I'm from Colli' Park, but I'm from Holleygrove<end_line>
Now all my bloods scream "Zoowoo! and Dadda-do!"<end_line>
I know my role, and I play it well<end_line>
And I wear it well, on my libra scale<end_line>
I suck a pussy, fuck a pussy leave it there<end_line>
I don't want it, I don't even care<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
It's my go, yeah<end_line>
And I'ma go so opposite of soft<end_line>
Off the richter, Hector<end_line>
Camacho Man Randy Savage<end_line>
Above status, quo, flow, so, pro<end_line>
I know, I ride slow and when I pass<end_line>
They say "Whaddup killa man?" Stop bringing up my past<end_line>
And next time you mention Pac, Biggie, or Jay-Z<end_line>
Don't forget Weezy baby!<end_line>
<verse_end>
