Uhh, I run this bitch<end_line>
Girl I let you run your mouth, she say "But I don't run from that dick"<end_line>
Alright I go so hard I put it down, I put it down, I leave a dent<end_line>
I am just tryna get my fuckin' mile.. out of an inch<end_line>
My ho a psycho-pathic with a fashion, habit<end_line>
Shake that ass, bitch, shake that ass, bitch; you a video model, action<end_line>
And cameras don't lie, you the truth; Christina Milian, you the truth<end_line>
So if your man screw up, you need a nigga like me, I'll knock every screw loose<end_line>
I'm just sayin', I'm not playin'<end_line>
