<verse_start>
And I don't love them hoes<end_line>
But don't fuck up with Wayne cause when it "Waynes" it pours<end_line>
No really, I'm on my "fuck that bitch" shit<end_line>
You used to be the shit but now you ain't shit bitch<end_line>
I had a redbone, but she be trippin though<end_line>
All that bullshit is for the birds, she was pigeontoed<end_line>
She used to always say, fuck my niggaz<end_line>
And when I went to jail, she fucked my niggaz<end_line>
Well~! I guess I'm single for tonight<end_line>
And you can sit right on my middle finger for the night<end_line>
And if I sound mad, then you caught me<end_line>
But this should explain, that you're the one that taught me<end_line>

Forgive and forget, bitch I already forgot<end_line>
I'm over the bitch, and she over the top<end_line>
They say love is the key, somebody changed the lock<end_line>
Well~! And I wish I never met ya<end_line>
And I heard you doin you, and you heard I'm doin better<end_line>
And all I had to do was put two and two together<end_line>
But that just makes four, but not for-ever, damn<end_line>
So much for being the perfect couple<end_line>
I put in overtime, I was workin doubles<end_line>
I wish you the best - good luck boo<end_line>
Weezy F, for Fuck You<end_line>
