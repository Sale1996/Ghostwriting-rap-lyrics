Man all you pussy niggas drive me crazy<end_line>
Make me sick to my stomach, I feel nauseated<end_line>
All you haters hold hands and jump off a building<end_line>
I could still taste her pussy, memorabilia<end_line>
Backpack full of artillery, one me, no equivalent<end_line>
These niggas actin' like lil bitches, I don't understand this shit like you scribbled it<end_line>
Took her clothes, step back and exhibit it, then tear her ass up like a parkin' ticket<end_line>
The end of the road is at walkin' distance, have to get that blood off my hands, left the faucet drippin'<end_line>
In yo face like a airbag in a car collision, my weed man so consistent<end_line>
I'm stayin rich, tryin not to make poor decisions, everything I do, I plan it out like a solar system<end_line>
Nigga if you clumsy you gon slip and fall a victim to me, your bitch is sendin' naked pictures to me<end_line>
Then she shoot over to my house, I scoot over in her bed, I shoot off in her mouth then she bit the bullet<end_line>
Uh, skatin on 'em like Iâm Lil Wayne, and the weed so strong I can feel veins<end_line>
Write it down, take a picture now I feel framed, the drugs got me so numb, I can't feel ashamed<end_line>
And my girl at home with the mood swings, girl I gotta make a few runs like Usain<end_line>
Wish I had a penny for my thoughts for some loose change, hungry niggas goin' at yo neck for that food chain<end_line>
Pop some pills that make me sleepy, hoes, creep me, in they teepee<end_line>
I hope that pussy, taste like kiwi, hope it's nicer than Tahiti, hopin' I could get a freebie<end_line>
Leavin' a nigga body floatin with a mouth full of seaweed, what's in my Louis backpack? That's E.T.<end_line>
Snitches give me the heebee, geebees, I hope they'll disappear, where the fuck is Houdini?<end_line>
I got niggas on my side, you got niggas on yo back, I'ma yell "Timber", money grow on trees<end_line>
Money over queens, fuck you blow me, I sit back enjoy the breeze, hoes prettier than please<end_line>
I don't really do shit but sit back and call the shots, she poured out her heart, I had it on the rocks<end_line>
Red beam on yo head, that's a cherry on top, you don't wanna keep your cool, I know niggas that'll die<end_line>
Uh, I danced with the devil in my dreams, when I wake up, I still hear the same song<end_line>
Make me wanna blow a motherfucker brains out, flood warnin' nigga, I'm about to brainstorm<end_line>
Lil nigga Iâll take yo main hoe, take her call her homegirl, make 'em share the same dick<end_line>
It's that motherfuckin "Dedication 5", I just hope I'll be alive to see a "Dedication 6"<end_line>
Lil Tunechi.. whattup slime?<end_line>
