Mic check 1, 2 on the way to third<end_line>
Flow sick, put a straight jacket on my words<end_line>
So sick, they think that something's in the herb<end_line>
They think I'm gone, but I'm fine like a woman's curves<end_line>
My personality is far from your reality, I'm closer to your girl<end_line>
now come on ho don't embarrass me! There is no comparising<end_line>
This right here be kerosene, carousel, parasail, I'm higher than everything.<end_line>
When I spit you can't drink it like your 17<end_line>
I can show a million pair of eyes that they've never seen<end_line>
And I can do this in whatever the weather brings<end_line>
Picasso couldn't paint a better scene, colossal<end_line>
Now give me the mike and I'll rock like a fucking fossil<end_line>
I'm mad at the track, and I'll beat it like Hector Cumacho<end_line>

I will be on VH1 when I'm done being famous<end_line>
Explain shit... I have made my way<end_line>
And you are just a stain bitch, you will fade away<end_line>
And I only leave my house to paper chase<end_line>
Yep, off to da jungle, where I feel safe<end_line>
Like a homerun in the bottom of the 9th inning<end_line>
And I'm fresh like I'm by Mennen..haa<end_line>

And before I leave her thighs bending<end_line>
She give me face first like she done dived in it..hahaha<end_line>
And if she tall I can climb in it;<end_line>
I usually don't have a time limit<end_line>
And eating pussy ain't a crime is it<end_line>
If so, I should start working on my jail visits<end_line>
You know...<end_line>
I'm in the game they just sell tickets<end_line>
Man I got old bread like stale biscuits<end_line>
You feeling froggy all you gotta do is yell ribbit<end_line>
Turn ya ass to a statue like an exhibit<end_line>
Now lets get it , let me at 'em<end_line>
Leave my cage open<end_line>
With no pyro I leave the stage smoking<end_line>

It go uptown - uptown operation shut down<end_line>
Wake up to polices, go to sleep to the gun sounds<end_line>
And your not a gorilla, your a dead monkey<end_line>
Cuz I got a banana clip in these Red Monkeys<end_line>
What you said don't be, afraid to say it twice<end_line>
And they say life is cheap, until you pay the price<end_line>
It's just like shaking dice, but I hope you roll a winner<end_line>
And if you are rat, your just a cobra's dinner<end_line>
Ya'll ain't fucking with me, you niggas underachieve<end_line>
<verse_end>

Like the light part of my feet<end_line>
And so what them niggas left me<end_line>
When they get cold I turns into Wayne Gretsky<end_line>
G to the N - I do's it like it's never been done<end_line>
So you can suck my dick with an elephants tounge<end_line>
It's weezy baby<end_line>
Motherfucker I spit rabies!<end_line>
