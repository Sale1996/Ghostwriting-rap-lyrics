Weezy yo<end_line>
Young Money, Cash Money<end_line>
This is, "Da Drought 3"<end_line>
Ladies and Gentlemen, you know me<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
You know I ride for my mother fuckin' niggas<end_line>
Most likely I'm a die with my finger on the trigger<end_line>
They tell me don't get high and I should try and make a living<end_line>
I tell 'em I'm a hustler and I'd rather make a killing<end_line>
My eyes be so wide as they rise in the skillet<end_line>
I let my bitch bag it, if she spill it I'm a kill her<end_line>
I bullet-proof the ride now I feel like armadillos<end_line>
And fuck a hospital, Young Money we the illest<end_line>
And I ain't gotta lie when I tell you I'm the illest<end_line>
My flow is nasty like CY Phillies<end_line>
Self-made G and them bitches know the business<end_line>
We lightin' all rappers in the kitchen, I'm a chemist<end_line>
And when I was five my favorite movie was The Gremlins<end_line>
Ain't got shit to do with this but I just thought that I should mention<end_line>
You lookin' for divine, and a little intervention <end_line>
And the Byrds don't fly without my permission<end_line>
I'm probably in the sky, flyin' with the fishes<end_line>
Or maybe in the ocean, swimmin' with the pigeons<end_line>
See my world is different, like Dwayne Wade<end_line>
And if you want trouble bitch, I want the same thang<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Fuck ten in the coup and your bitch love it<end_line>
Switchin' lanes, fast third then she switch subjects<end_line>
Tell a bitch "don't talk to me,<end_line>
And if you talkin' to them niggas, don't talk for free"<end_line>
And I hate when a nigga say, "talk is cheap"<end_line>
'Cause I'm the type to let money talk for me, yeah<end_line>
My flow is art unique, yeah<end_line>
My flow can part a sea<end_line>
The only thing on the mind of a shark is eat<end_line>
By any means and you just sardines <end_line>
I got the 40 cal tucked in my PRP's<end_line>
What do you expect, I'm from New Orleans <end_line>
And the guarantee of my city is riders<end_line>
They tryin' to make a brand-new map without us<end_line>
But the tourists come down and spend too many dollars<end_line>
And no matter how you change it it'll still be ours<end_line>
<verse_end>
