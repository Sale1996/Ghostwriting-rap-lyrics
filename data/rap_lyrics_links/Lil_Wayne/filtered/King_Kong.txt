<verse_start>
I pop my trunk and everybody get to running<end_line>
The fireman bitch, like my body in the oven<end_line>
I'm one egg short, I'm just tryin to get a dozen<end_line>
My name like honey, it got alotta bitches buzzing<end_line>
The neck of the barrel, is so long and narrow<end_line>
And it shoot a bunch, you just lunchin and munching like Farrel<end_line>
Bloodshot eye's on the sparrow<end_line>
And I stay high, but on-point like an arrow<end_line>
Street nigga baby, I'm in love with the gravel<end_line>
Money gives me life like a man with the gavel<end_line>
I'm strapped at home, I'm strapped when i travel<end_line>
I pop my trunk and make the bitches spread like cattle<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
...and I feed him banana clips<end_line>
And let him sing, like Gladys Knight and the Pips<end_line>
I'm just sticking to the muthafuckin manuscript<end_line>
Understand I'm tryin to get the chips and the dip<end_line>
Better know I hold that gun, with a Panther grip<end_line>
My hollow bullets got tips, like a dancer bitch<end_line>
Where my money? Where my money? You need to answer quick<end_line>
Gotta get back on my ransom shit.. and put you<end_line>
So you'll be laying, ontop of speakers<end_line>
Holes all in you, like an old pair of sneakers<end_line>
Before I do a day, on the edge, I will leap first<end_line>
Bet you any money that, I will land feet first<end_line>
Married to the Benjamins, battle all my enemies<end_line>
Riding with Big Foot, Harry, and the Hendersons<end_line>
Godzilla, King Kong and if I have to park<end_line>
I will open up my trunk and it will be Jurassic Park<end_line>
<verse_end>
