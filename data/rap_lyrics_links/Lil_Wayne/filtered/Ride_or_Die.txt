Load it up with black gats and macs<end_line>
Pay attention to gun blastin <end_line>
And fake buster harassin<end_line>
Smashin, dashin up yo street wit all the lights out <end_line>
Two choppers cocked ready to knot <end_line>
And chop up yo block<end_line>
Lock all doors and keep windows closed<end_line>
Cause we done rolled before<end_line>
So stay on the floor<end_line>
We ride deep in the all black camaro<end_line>
Sittin on mo's <end_line>
And we rolls tokin on fat optimos<end_line>

You done got on a straight ride and cant get off<end_line>
Lets all get a stolen car<end_line>
And roll through they ward<end_line>
