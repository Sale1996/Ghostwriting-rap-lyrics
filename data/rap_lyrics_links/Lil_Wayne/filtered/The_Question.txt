<verse_start>
Sittin' in my Bentley, thinkin' bout these hoes<end_line>
All I do is kill them, I kill them like Nicole<end_line>
Simpson, flag crimson, smoke them like Winstons<end_line>
I just bought a new chopper, I treat it like an infant<end_line>
I'm lightin' up a stogie, It's longer than a hoagie<end_line>
Situation's gettin' fishy and I don't eat anchovies<end_line>
Fuck the world, Kill them all, she answer when I call<end_line>
If the cops pull us over, she gon' hide it in her drawers<end_line>
See I come from a place where stars never shine<end_line>
And drama is accepted, credit cards are declined<end_line>
Everybody gotta die, but I ain't everybody<end_line>
If that ho play with me, I whoop that chick like Terrence Howard<end_line>
I'm a pimp, I ain't lyin', but that is not important<end_line>
I'm just tryna to buy time, but can't really afford it<end_line>
Saying ain't that a bitch, but I hope that bitch is bad<end_line>
I feel like money in the trash like<end_line>
