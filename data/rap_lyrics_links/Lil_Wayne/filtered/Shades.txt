Before you get here put yo' panties in yo' pocketbook<end_line>
That's what I told her over the Motorola, Hennessy and cola<end_line>
I hold her at attention with my manners<end_line>
And even though I don't roll a camera<end_line>
She still performs like the superstar she truly are<end_line>
So - also I think I love her already<end_line>
Damn - I think I... already<end_line>
She must be the one; I look in her eyes and see the sun<end_line>
Even on rainy days, ain't it crazy mayne?<end_line>
Yeah, that's what I said<end_line>
She do doughnuts in my head<end_line>
Over, and over, and over<end_line>
'Til the cops pull her over<end_line>
And then she say some real slick shit like<end_line>
"I'm on my way from Weezy baby," cheah<end_line>
And of course they let her go<end_line>
