Come on, come on<end_line>
Come on, come on, come on, come on<end_line>
Ain't nothin' nice or sweet<end_line>
They don't even much understand this<end_line>
Now when I crawl up out the Rove' I got quarters and O's<end_line>
Forty-fours under my clothes, I'm drunk and blowed<end_line>
And I done told them boys if they play I dump their mothers<end_line>
Now they findin' niggas everyday slumped in gutters<end_line>
I come through on the block strapped, bumpin' Bubba<end_line>
for the summer in a bright orange pumpkin Hummer<end_line>
StumblinÂ’ from the Courvoisier, and lots of hay<end_line>
And make me run in your place and take your pops away<end_line>
See, they got niggas in my hood who can't cop the yay<end_line>
So I can get it understood and have you chopped today<end_line>
And not to say I could even hit your block and spray<end_line>
And try to knock all the bone structure out your face<end_line>
Stick a potato on the head of my nine, it's deadly quiet<end_line>
Leave a nigga redder than swine, you damn pig<end_line>
The plan is to take everything and kill 'em all<end_line>
Young or old, nigga, big or small<end_line>
Ain't nothin' nice<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Now we all do dumb things<end_line>
Playin' with Wayne doesn't have to be one of 'em<end_line>
I'll murder his father right in front of him<end_line>
None of 'em are ready for the trouble I'm 'bout<end_line>
Pull up in a bubble, hop out, then let a couple pop out<end_line>
I got two double Desert Eagles, bustin' at your peoples<end_line>
Cussin' at polices, and roughin' up your nieces<end_line>
See me just off the meters <end_line>
Don't leave without the heaters<end_line>
Believe this, my nina's got more shelves than Adidas<end_line>
You see the slick jackin', believe it's glocks and millimeters<end_line>
Run up on your family and pop your senioritas<end_line>
A lot of Hennessy, just twist that lil' baby<end_line>
Damn, them hollow tips just missed that lil' baby<end_line>
This is definitely, step to me, get a hysterectomy<end_line>
Technically I'll murder anyone who disrespectin' me<end_line>
Seventeen Carollton, mess with me, I bury one<end_line>
Three-eighty, I carry one<end_line>
Come to kill up everyone<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Everybody freeze and drop when Lil Wheezy cock<end_line>
And niggas be like Q-Tip 'cause they breath and stop<end_line>
Believe or not, the ki's ten G's a wat<end_line>
Until I die apple and Eagle that be's the block<end_line>
And he's so hot that four hundred degrees the spot<end_line>
And weed and vodk' got me wanna beat a cop<end_line>
I grease the glock, the scope with the beam and dot<end_line>
And I'm hangin' out the Beamer top releasin' shots<end_line>
Follow me, everybody in the family die sourly<end_line>
Niggas drop hourly ruinin' your economy<end_line>
Liquor power me, now there's nothin' that can bother me<end_line>
Creep up in your window while you're sleepin', take your child with me<end_line>
I'm wild, and Wheezy more violent than Dennis Rodman<end_line>
Slide up in a blue truck and shoot-up a whole lot of men<end_line>
A lot of heat, a lot of fire, a blazer like Stoudamire<end_line>
Ride around your neighborhood and you wake up with bodies by your house<end_line>
<verse_end>
