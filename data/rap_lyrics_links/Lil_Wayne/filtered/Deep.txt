Anything can happen cause a broke man is an optimist<end_line>
Well tell them I'll be waiting in suspense<end_line>
I got some miles on me but it's cool cause I never get an inch<end_line>
And I don't give two fucks about what your mouth say<end_line>
Cause shit is deep and in rap I cannot say<end_line>
