<verse_start>
I tell her... "Now gon' pop that pussy for a real nigga"<end_line>
I already know that life is deep, but I still dig her<end_line>
Niggaz is jealous, but really I could care less<end_line>
I'm in Hell's Kitchen with an apron and a hairnet<end_line>
Devil on my shoulder, The Lord is my witness<end_line>
So on my Libra scale, I'm weighin sins and forgiveness<end_line>
What goes around comes around like a hula hoop<end_line>
Karma is a bitch, well just make sure that bitch is beautiful<end_line>
Life on the edge, I'm danglin my feet<end_line>
I tried to pay attention but attention paid me<end_line>
Haters can't see me, nose-bleed seats<end_line>
and today I went shoppin, and talk is still cheap<end_line>
I rock to the beat of my drum set<end_line>
I've been at the top for a while and I ain't jump yet, hehe<end_line>
But I'm, Ray Charles to the bullshit<end_line>
Now jump up on that dick and do a full split <end_line>

I tell her... "Now gon' pop that pussy for a real nigga"<end_line>
Haters cain't see me but them bitches still lookin for me<end_line>
And you could take it to the bank, and deposit that<end_line>
Put your two cents inm and get a dollar back<end_line>
Some people hang you out to dry like a towel rack<end_line>
I'm all about +I+, give the rest of the vowels back<end_line>
I like my girl thick, not just kinda fine<end_line>
Eat her 'til she cry, call that "wine and dine"<end_line>
Try to check me and I'ma have 'em checkin pulses<end_line>
They say choose wisely, that's why I was chosen<end_line>
Rockin like asphalt, it's the cash's fault<end_line>
Looked in the face of death, and took its mask off<end_line>
Now I like my house big and my grass soft<end_line>
I like my girl face south, and her ass north<end_line>
But I'm, Ray Charles to the bullshit<end_line>
Now hop up on that dick and do a full split <end_line>
<verse_end>
