I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes<end_line>
Hate in my heart, love in my mind<end_line>
I seen nights full of pain, days are the same<end_line>
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain<end_line>
I search but never find, hurt but never cry<end_line>
I work and forever try but I'm cursed so never mind<end_line>
And it's worse but better times seem further and beyond<end_line>
The top gets higher, the more that I climb<end_line>
The spot gets smaller, and I get bigger<end_line>
Tryin to get in where I fit in, no room for a nigga<end_line>
But, soon for a nigga it be on muh'fucker<end_line>
Cause, all this bullshit done made me strong muh'fucker!<end_line>
So I<end_line>

Uhh, I know what they don't wanna tell you<end_line>
Just hope you're heaven-sent, and you're hell-proof<end_line>
I-I walk up in the world and cut the lights off<end_line>
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off<end_line>
Huh, my word is my pride<end_line>
But wisdom is bleak and that's a word from the wise<end_line>
Served to survive, murdered and bribed<end_line>
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside<end_line>
So I could<end_line>
<verse_end>
