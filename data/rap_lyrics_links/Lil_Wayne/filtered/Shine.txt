And the name be fire Wayne, ice and change<end_line>
You can catch me in an aqua range, squattin things<end_line>
With them twenty-two inch chopper blades<end_line>
Diamond face, diamond brace<end_line>
More colors than the game Simon Says<end_line>
Go, 'hind me<end_line>
And mami on forty-fifth she told me "I'm a lez"<end_line>
And she ain't like too much of dick <end_line>
but give the bombest head, and so I took it anyway<end_line>
But bitch I got family, don't need your pussy anyway<end_line>
OK, let's talk about this ice that I'm carryin<end_line>
All these karats like I'm a fuckin vegetarian<end_line>
Niggas play, I bury them, y'all already knowin<end_line>
I threw up my arm and bitches thought it started snowin<end_line>
See I'm a keep it goin, Big Tymin, you heard's me?<end_line>
