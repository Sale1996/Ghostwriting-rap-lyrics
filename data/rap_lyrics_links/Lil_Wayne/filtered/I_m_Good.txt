Everything I said I'd do, I did<end_line>
I'm good, I'm good<end_line>
Everything I said I'd do, I did<end_line>
Hm-mm, yeah<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
But baby let's face it<end_line>
I'm not into datin'<end_line>
I haven't been patient<end_line>
Ever since I been famous, my time has been racin'<end_line>
My motives are basic<end_line>
This life I've been chasin'<end_line>
These hearts I've been breakin'<end_line>
And these girls I been tastin' don't never get naked<end_line>
They like it in a headlock, fuck 'em from behind<end_line>
Fuck 'em with their clothes on, put it to the side<end_line>
Feelings to the sidelike a don do<end_line>
Get 'em wet, let it slide like a sunroof<end_line>
Got goals, got dreams, got a hotel crib<end_line>
Got niggas that'll die for the prince<end_line>
Got my city on lock, XO 'til the death<end_line>
Left town in a coach, came back in a jet<end_line>
