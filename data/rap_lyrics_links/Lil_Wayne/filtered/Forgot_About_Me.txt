<verse_start>
Just when they thought it was safe<end_line>
I picked up the phone and called it a day<end_line>
I bought a new car, caught a new case - fuck it<end_line>
The harder I walk, the ground shall shake<end_line>
Stompin, the harder I march, the ground will break<end_line>
I am, groundbreakin, like an earthquake, heh-heh<end_line>
Yeah, I run this shit, but I'll tackle it<end_line>
You want me to break it down, I'ma fracture it<end_line>
My mind is wanderin, I can't find it<end_line>
But ten times outta ten, my mind on the mon-ey<end_line>
Bandana around my head like I know karate<end_line>
And I'll wax a nigga's ass like Mister Miyagi<end_line>
And it ain't over 'til the fat lady sang<end_line>
And that bitch got a whole lot more weight to gain<end_line>
And call me by my new name<end_line>
featuring Lil Wayne<end_line>
