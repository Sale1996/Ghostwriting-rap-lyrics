<verse_start>
 I feel like a black Republican<end_line>
Tote a MAC'n Republican<end_line>
Act so southern n' die for my brethren<end_line>
Money, money, money<end_line>
Like money Mac and publishing<end_line>
One life to live, never ask for a mulligan<end_line>
Streets call but the heat make me feel covenant<end_line>
Been done had cake day late like Anne Sullivan<end_line>
Fly like an eagle but no I'm no Donovan<end_line>
Boy you better go eat some soup with your mom n' them<end_line>
And my mind is on another continent<end_line>
I am real Cash Money, no counterfeit<end_line>
I don't parkin' lot pimp I just politick<end_line>
But I get all in her mouth like parlithins<end_line>
New always represent it to the inner<end_line>
Come from the city where the glitter don't glimmer<end_line>
The sun don't shine and the guns don't sleep<end_line>
Pick a nigga's ass up like he got somewhere to be<end_line>
