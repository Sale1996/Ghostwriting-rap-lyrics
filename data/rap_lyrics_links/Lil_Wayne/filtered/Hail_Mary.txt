<verse_start>
Tunchi in this muthafucka<end_line>
Hail Mary, full of grace<end_line>
I don't remember her name<end_line>
But I remember how her pussy tastes<end_line>
I go long, so long, she love the way that I put it down<end_line>
Got you goin' in circles, all you gotta do is look around<end_line>
I'm Mr. Right and she's Ms. Tonight<end_line>
Pussy so nice, gotta kiss it twice<end_line>
Pussy so tight my tongue get stuck<end_line>
My tongue get stuck like lickin' ice<end_line>
Hoes call me QB, I throw that dick too deep<end_line>
I told her she's the preacher's wife<end_line>
She said practice what you preach<end_line>
She said "ah, me so horny, he love me long time"<end_line>
I say how 'bout 69, she say numbers don't lie<end_line>
I say true, you ain't never told no lie<end_line>
You ain't never told no lie<end_line>
And you know they say love is blind<end_line>
So close your eyes<end_line>
