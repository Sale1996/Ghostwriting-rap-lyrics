<verse_start>
Trying to fuck the world, I can't fit<end_line>
Pockets fat as St. Nick<end_line>
All I got is my niggas<end_line>
Cause a bitch still ain't shit<end_line>
And I got kush all in my swisha<end_line>
These niggas is tissue<end_line>
I don't believe in these niggas<end_line>
Cause I don't believe in superstition<end_line>
Juve, I got you, dread like Rasta, hair like pasta, I go meatballs<end_line>
I get up in that ass and hit it fast as Chinese ping pong<end_line>
And my bitch, she got that fire<end_line>
My homey got that iron<end_line>
But I tell 'em "Put it away and you could Punch like a Hawaiian"<end_line>
Bitch it's Tunechi F. Baby, I'm a, original Hot Boy<end_line>
My dick felt like a prisoner cause this bitch got lock jaw<end_line>
I'm so feelin' myself<end_line>

My red bone is ice cold, I'm a fuck the bitch til she melt<end_line>

Bitch, I'm N-O til I G-O<end_line>
I can't change if I try<end_line>
I looked to my left, I looked to my right<end_line>
And time ain't on my side<end_line>
So that's why I light my blunt<end_line>
Fat and out of shape<end_line>
Money on my mind<end_line>
Pussy on my face<end_line>
