<verse_start>
I am the beast<end_line>
Feed me rappers or feed me beats<end_line>
I am untamed, I need a leash<end_line>
I am insane, I need a shrink<end_line>
I love brain, I need a leech<end_line>
Why complain on easy streets?<end_line>
I don't even talk, I let the Visa speak<end_line>
and I like, my Sprite Easter pink<end_line>
And my wrist special par but the Mula's cooler<end_line>
I have more jewels than your jeweler<end_line>
Touch and I will bust, your medulla<end_line>
That's a bullethole, it is not a tumor<end_line>
Red light, red light, stop your rumors<end_line>
I stay on track like a box of Pumas<end_line>
Now just r-r-rock with Junior<end_line>
I am the little big Kahuna, y'dig?<end_line>
