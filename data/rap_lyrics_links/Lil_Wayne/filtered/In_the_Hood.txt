<verse_start>
Uptown New Orleans, like always<end_line>
Cash Money boy, shine like bald heads<end_line>
Big Bezel make my watch look like a hog head<end_line>
And all I do is smoke trees, call me a log head<end_line>
I'm butter on the break like Parkay<end_line>
And I am all about me like Doe Ray<end_line>
I'm in the hood, I'm the hood like dope, yay<end_line>
Nappy ass hair like Buckweed, otay<end_line>
Hollygrove, Ether St. be my damn hood<end_line>
Where you can murdered for free like can goods<end_line>
I got 12 barbaros under the lamb hood<end_line>
I can bring a Kentucky Derby to the damn hood<end_line>
Sunshine diamonds help me tan good<end_line>
And I'll let it blow like a band wood<end_line>
I'll call Brisco, I'm on South Beach<end_line>
30 minutes later, Opa Locka is where I'll be<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Man, I'm so Hollygrove<end_line>
Stand strong in that water like a commodor<end_line>
Black holes in yo white tee, dominoes<end_line>
Me and Brisco, Cash Money carnivores<end_line>
I am New Orleans like carnival<end_line>
And in the hood, call me Weezy the Honorable<end_line>
These other rappers so ironicle<end_line>
And if I ain't in the mansion, then I'm up in the Phantom or...<end_line>
<verse_end>
