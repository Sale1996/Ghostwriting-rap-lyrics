<verse_start>
Live from the five hundred and four<end_line>
It's Mr. Crazy flow, jumpin' like a bunjinal rope<end_line>
Even in the dungeon I glow, even if it ain't sunny I glow<end_line>
If it ain't 'bout money I go, no where I nail to the flo'<end_line>
Money controls where I go, it is the sail to my boat<end_line>
And it's goin' down, it's goin' down, like there's a whale in the boat<end_line>
See you can smell that I smoke, and yup, I sip that lean<end_line>
You hit me with that combination, it make my eyes bleed<end_line>
I'm a shark in the water, yeah I swim with the big<end_line>
So I don't have time to deal with Willy The Squid<end_line>
L-L-Lilly pad niggas, L-L-Look at the monster<end_line>
Y-Y-You don't wanna crash like LaLaLaBamba<end_line>
See it's me Ronna and Terry and my new drop is very<end_line>
Watermelon plum, just call it fruit punch<end_line>
I'm a old rapper, gettin' new bucks<end_line>
And all you new rappers, you're just new lunch<end_line>
Flow sick, so sick, need a Doc yes<end_line>
A creature, monster, like the Locness<end_line>
I gets hotter by the top, before I sizzle to death<end_line>
I just tell the clock gimme a sec<end_line>
In the middle of the war, where my enemy at<end_line>
I'm runnin' this bitch like Eric The Enemy Back<end_line>
Cause everytime I hear the track I'm like a energy pack<end_line>
The intruments are crying out, where the sympathy at?<end_line>
Yeah, if you ran the money baby, him'll be back<end_line>
Whatever legends look like, bitch i finner be that<end_line>
I walk right in Hip-Hop like where my dinner be at?<end_line>
I ate that and I was like, where my dinner be at?<end_line>
I hate that women lie, so I lie to them back<end_line>
Got two bitches in my pants, quiet nod to them back<end_line>
A lot of bitches want dick, I give alot of them that<end_line>
Let's do a pill, I could fuck you for an hour with that<end_line>
And to the kids, drugs kill, I'm a knowledge in that<end_line>
But when I'm on the drug, I don't have a problem with that<end_line>
And my niggas got guns the size of tallers biatch<end_line>
And we aimin' right at your fuckin collar biatch, Pow!<end_line>
