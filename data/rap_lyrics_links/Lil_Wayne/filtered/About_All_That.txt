Young desperado straight out the grotto<end_line>
I'm so bad my shadow chooses not to follow<end_line>
Little nigga but see me as a fuckin' rhino<end_line>
Lil Weezy hit this bitch like Rocky Marciano<end_line>
It's a drought ain't it? How the fuck would I know?<end_line>

I ran the streets... check my bio<end_line>
I started high wit' two O's just like Ohio<end_line>

But I'm so DC like fat shoes<end_line>
I skate away... like later dudes!<end_line>
Never get caught baby I'm mashed potato smooth<end_line>
And just when it stopped... I made it move<end_line>
Respect me nigga I'm a dog... no Asian food<end_line>
