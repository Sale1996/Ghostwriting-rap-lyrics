Uh, shawty badder than a three year old<end_line>
Keep playing and I'm a eat her like a pita roll<end_line>
I'm just saying, with my love, I can feed her soul<end_line>
Two day getaway and we don't need our clothes<end_line>
We at the pool and she looking like a centerfold<end_line>
Two tattoos, but she say she's getting plenty mo'<end_line>
She got Indian in her family, Seminole<end_line>
Me, and shawty go together like chemicals<end_line>
And she get mad when I call other women hoes<end_line>
You send her Rose, I pick some flowers and send her those<end_line>
Tall glass of Marlowe, get her in the mode<end_line>
Two tall glasses of Marlowe, get her out her robe<end_line>
I whisper in her ear, then lick around her lobe<end_line>
And when she check her watch, it's never time to go<end_line>
And with her brain, she should make the honor roll<end_line>
And when I came, she caught me like the common cold<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
D-D-Damn, you're the shit<end_line>
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit<end_line>
And I don't really know how to handle the shit<end_line>
But tonight, it's moonlight and candles and shit<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Uh, I say, damn I must be there<end_line>
Because you're the best that I ever seen right<end_line>
Shawty put me on, you got me gone like some green lights<end_line>
See you with your girls, they probably telling you that he ain't right<end_line>
Then they be the same bitches at the wedding throwing riiice<end_line>
Let's get together overnight<end_line>
shawty I'm a pro and you were looking like the prototype<end_line>
Macita, I took your advice<end_line>
Sometimes you got to blow it twice, then shake it up and roll the dice<end_line>
I'm cruising on the road to life but I need a passenger<end_line>
Appetite for love and ma, I'm hungry like a scavenger<end_line>
I-I be on that lavender, I-I be in the bath with her<end_line>
Then I gotta go under that water like a mariner<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
D-D-Damn, you're the shit<end_line>
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit<end_line>
And I don't really know how to handle the shit<end_line>
But tonight, it's moonlight and candles and shit<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Uh, now she don't know about me, but I'm a put her on it<end_line>
And she ain't sure about me, but can't go without me<end_line>
We probably ain't supposed to be together<end_line>
but I wonder if a love affair could last forever?<end_line>
And shawty, I'm weak, smoke a lot of weed but I can never forget ya<end_line>
And then I told her to her face<end_line>
If everyone was like you, the world would be a better place<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
D-D-Damn, you're the shit<end_line>
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit<end_line>
And I don't really know how to handle the shit<end_line>
But tonight, it's moonlight and candles and shit<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
D-D-Damn, you're the shit<end_line>
And I'll rip my heart out and hand you the shit<end_line>
And I don't really know how to handle the shit<end_line>
But tonight<end_line>
<verse_end>
