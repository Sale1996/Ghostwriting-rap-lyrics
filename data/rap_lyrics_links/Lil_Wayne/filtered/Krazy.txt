Tell me somethin' I don't know<end_line>
I'm flexin' on 'em like torsos<end_line>
These niggas slippin' like bar soap<end_line>
These niggas listenin', use Morse code<end_line>
Boy a nigga sippin' like parched throat<end_line>
Excuse me<end_line>
These niggas talkin' that beef shit<end_line>
We'll check into it like the room cheap<end_line>
And all we sell is the greatest feelin' on Earth<end_line>
They paint me as a villain, I just autograph the artwork<end_line>
Ain't got nothing left to prove unless I got to prove it in court<end_line>
Live fast die young and leave a beautiful corpse, yes Lord<end_line>
My nigga order like twenty bricks, I said five bricks with four chicks<end_line>
Ridin' with these guns that's carpoolin', bought extra clips when I dove in<end_line>
Miss Snow white we snowed in, nigga miss me with that hoe shit<end_line>
Kill all rats, I toast to that, and watch everybody I toast with<end_line>
Kill everybody you close with, Just don't stick your nose in<end_line>
My bullshit cause I close it like a clothespin<end_line>
The people that I rolls with will leave holes in what you drove in<end_line>
If anyone in that car live, you tell that nigga I owe him<end_line>
Yeah, I got my mind right, and my money right, my head on my shoulder<end_line>
And my eyesight a lil' blurry but I'm stayin' on my quota<end_line>
And we find out moms address and your head get mailed over<end_line>
Nigga you make that bed you lay in that bed<end_line>
Or get that bitch made over<end_line>

<verse_start>
Tell me something I don't know, I'll tell you something I do know<end_line>
Like money drugs bitches guns, niggas call me mucho<end_line>
Got witches all in my broom closet, got little killers in Juco<end_line>
We'll find out your business hours and pop up like new toast<end_line>
Like danger taste like glucose, my shadow don't get too close<end_line>
To that new nigga with my old hoes-kudos<end_line>
For my niggas on Rikers Island back there playing Uno<end_line>
Getting swole like popeye for niggas walking around like Bruno<end_line>
I'm in the bed with a duo, laid up like two points<end_line>
A.K to your face, knock half off like coupons<end_line>
Too cool for school but I sold cool points to school boys<end_line>
Tell the cops we don't name drop that's like dropping newborns<end_line>
Nigga you crazy<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Like where the fuck did my heart go, and show me something I haven't seen<end_line>
And give me what Martin sleep, on the same night he had a dream<end_line>
And take me to where I've never been, but not to where I'll never be<end_line>
And I ain't never scared but I'm scared of me, me versus me I need a referee<end_line>
Need weaponry, especially if the treasury in jeopardy<end_line>
Fuck deputies big letter B, need equity, need credit clean<end_line>
To trafficking from peddling like everything from amphetamines to medicine<end_line>
These niggas sweeter than Nectarines and Grenadine<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Tell me something I don't know, like what happened to hard coke<end_line>
You can call me Eddy cause I stay ready, my family call me Eduardo<end_line>
I'm music to these bitches ears I hit that ass like the wrong note<end_line>
My bitch bad with corn rows with boots on in farm clothes<end_line>
You can find me prancing in the finest mansion with the finest dancer with a height advantage<end_line>
She want cocaine pills and weed, liquor and dick she gotta micro manage<end_line>
I'm just eating rappers they go nice in salads with some diced up carrots<end_line>
I just like a challenge, psychopathic, so psychopathic<end_line>
Nigga give me credit on my balance<end_line>
Lil Tunechi<end_line>
