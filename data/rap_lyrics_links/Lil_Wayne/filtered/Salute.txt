<verse_start>
Uh, now just say hello to the captain<end_line>
And I stay away from magnets cuz the metals what I'm packin<end_line>
Bet yo brains on your shirt will look like jello on a napkin<end_line>
and I promise my fellows will put your fellow on the canvas<end_line>
Call me Weezy F. Baby<end_line>
Young money army, better yet Navy<end_line>
Fab I got'em<end_line>
And watch me get'em<end_line>
And I do'em or I did them<end_line>
And this tool inside my denim<end_line>
I shoot everything but women, and kids<end_line>
Bitch nigga stop bitchin its just how it is<end_line>
Now watch me let that sexy nina kiss you by your ribs<end_line>
You wont be satisfied till I send a missile by your crib<end_line>
Shoot you in the stomach now you pissin out your ears<end_line>
Holly grove all day<end_line>
Bodies in the hallway<end_line>
And If you come searchin<end_line>
Then you're finding out the hard way<end_line>
Uh, no matter where your from<end_line>
You better recognize a real nigga when you see one<end_line>
