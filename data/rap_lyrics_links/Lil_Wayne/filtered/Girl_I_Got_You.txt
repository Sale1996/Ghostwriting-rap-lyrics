As I was walkin by I seen you standin there with a smile<end_line>
Lookin shy, caught my eye, thought you wanna hang a while<end_line>

So baby let's get away, save the troubles for another day<end_line>
Ha! Jammin "Escapade" in the lot<end_line>
With Escalade on the back, your homie's whack, I promise that<end_line>
It ain't trickin if you got it might as well spend a stack<end_line>
I hit the mall and ball down call me young Steven Jackson<end_line>
And I'm the one and I won with no games played<end_line>
Never have to work in our life, babe we got it made<end_line>
Every day's a vacat', in Miami like Dade<end_line>
And we ain't ever clean up baby cause I got maids<end_line>
Ha! Young money we so paid<end_line>
And if you ever get hurt, baby I'm ya Band-Aid<end_line>

Ha! And when I'm on the road, you go to my house<end_line>
And walk my bulldog, and help my moms out<end_line>
