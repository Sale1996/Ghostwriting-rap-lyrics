<verse_start>
Where's my matches? Where's my matches?<end_line>
Put the whole world in a casket<end_line>
And I'm gon' watch this world just burn to ashes<end_line>
Turn to ashes<end_line>
One day this world gon' turn to ashes<end_line>
And I'm a just sit back laughing<end_line>
And when I tried to kick that habit<end_line>
Man I was like: "Where's my matches? Where's my matches? "<end_line>
This whole world is aware of my actions<end_line>
But they ain't that bad compared to taxes<end_line>
Ashes, all I see is ashes<end_line>
As the world burns<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
As I watch the trees fall down to the pavement<end_line>
