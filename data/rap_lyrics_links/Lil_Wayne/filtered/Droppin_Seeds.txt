<verse_start>
Like Adam in the Garden of Eden<end_line>
My bitch got an apple bottom and she swallow my seeds<end_line>
Follow my lead, fire I breathe, water my seed<end_line>
And sit back and watch money grow on trees<end_line>
Droppin' seeds like classes, these hoes drop they asses<end_line>
I drop a seed in her panties if it smell like pansies<end_line>
I'm a banshee in her panties, nigga ask your mammy<end_line>
Never played golf but got a driver and a Caddy<end_line>
Whole squad +Slammin'+ like Onyx, you know Sticky Fingaz<end_line>
Some drop science, I'm droppin' English<end_line>
Even if Tyler, named this song "Flower"<end_line>
No seeds in the bud, still don't trust bugs<end_line>
I'm down.. Mula!<end_line>
