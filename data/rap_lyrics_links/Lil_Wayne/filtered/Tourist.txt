Ahem; Wayne's world, party time, excellent<end_line>
She might be a tourist or a terrorist, a Hell's Angel actin' like she Heaven sent, Lord<end_line>
We can go sight seein' and all that, she can be wifey and all that<end_line>
She's the tourist, I'm her tour guide, cause he just bullshit, I hit bullseye<end_line>
The weed got her lightheaded, red eyes, I told her "Don't worry, we stay high<end_line>
Plus there's a bed on my tour bus, so you can get fucked as we pull out, Lord"<end_line>
I pull out like skrrt in New Orleans, I pull up her skirt and get gnarly<end_line>
She come to Wayne's world just to party, and all of my tourists is foreign<end_line>
