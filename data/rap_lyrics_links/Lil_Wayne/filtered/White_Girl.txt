<verse_start>
Listen...I'ma hundred percent hussla from my face to my feet<end_line>
My lifetime cases the street, my dime places the street<end_line>
Until I wake and see another fuckin day is relief<end_line>
I pray that he keep, I'm scrappin my knees from chasing this cheese<end_line>
I had point guard dreams of playin for some team<end_line>
Hit the block and made NBA money in one week<end_line>
See I hussle in the hood and plus I fly birdies<end_line>
And play the tracks out every month so I can ride dirty<end_line>
needed someone to manage my money I hired Shelly<end_line>
But Shelly started talkin to much so she died early<end_line>
They got me loadin up my Benz with my eyes blurry<end_line>
I sent the message to the fucker at bout five thirty<end_line>
Now if the bitch aint got my dice for me then I'm sorry<end_line>
But i'ma leave everyone who outside bloody<end_line>
And then I go in the stash get the coke and the cash<end_line>
I'm lettin niggas score it for half, I'm hopein it last<end_line>
But still nigga don't, I might have to just go in the lap<end_line>
And if its slow in the ass back to the rope and the mask<end_line>
<verse_end>
