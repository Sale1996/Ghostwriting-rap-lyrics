<verse_start>
Ooh, I know you dykin' who you eatin' on<end_line>
Make me think about all them nights we got a threesome on<end_line>
Make me think about how you suck it like your teeth are gone<end_line>
If your friends hatin' on you, fuck 'em to each his own, yessir<end_line>
I do my drugs then I sleep 'em off<end_line>
Like it just be callin' me, I need to turn my ringer off<end_line>
Ain't a fuckin' singalong unless you brought the weed along<end_line>
That kush - okay I got it, that kush<end_line>
Cop pounds and put my people on<end_line>
We can take the stairs up to the stars, that's where we belong<end_line>
Fuck that shit you talk, I beat that pussy like production<end_line>
Or like Rocky, beat the Russian; or like Jordan, beat the buzzer<end_line>
Nigga, gimme what you've got, take that money like an usher<end_line>
One man band, all you hear is repercussion<end_line>
Told a bitch "Too much selfish gonna lead to self destruction"<end_line>
She looked me in my eyes and said "Man, I ain't worried 'bout nothin'"<end_line>
I said "Shorty, you a beast"<end_line>
