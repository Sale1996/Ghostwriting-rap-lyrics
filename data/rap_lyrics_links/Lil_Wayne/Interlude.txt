[Intro]
Carter IV, it's on

[Tech N9ne]
Heart's what it is, watch what the kid drops
I'ma get the prop if you're not with the biz
Not only other regions I really popped at the crib
So hatin motherfuckers you better stop with the jibs
All for the dibs but I'm boss it don't matter what the cost
when I live right across from the Wiz
The Killer City will have a nigga lost in the Mids
Doin nothin but mothers stackin pussy coffin again
What is happenin is a merger, different levels of murder
Lil Weezy cook it and I'ma serve her
Further, guess what I'ma go do wit this women when we're eatin Gerber?
Mama said to kill 'em all and I heard her
Thank you baby for what became Lil Wayne
It's gettin all the people knowin the Strange in the game
I been really able to hang in the fame
But when he shouted my name there's been a change in my lane
{*grrr*} I'm a clusterfucker
lovin nothin but to get your brain
And I be stuck in lust and quick to bust a nut
and take a nigga's dame with no shame
Well they be bustin nothin thinkin they thuggin tough
but never do knuckle up, you in the game, you bang
You drunk and touchin everythang, you lame
Sucker, you cannot sustain the rain
Tech N9ne is such a cuckoo in this
Ballin nigga, Strange Music, Coupe through Swishers
I know a lot of you probably, never knew who this is
Well you listenin to Tecca Nina, soo woo bid'ness~!

[Andre 3000]
Today I feel electric gray, I hope tomorrow neon black
I tell a nigga all those flows are borrowed
It's the phar-aoh, Three Stacks
I woke up in Cai-ro, lookin at stars
So bright in the sky I thought they were marbles
No car do's, what'cha call those?
A whole car load, of raw hoes; in a Jeep Defender
Please remember, don't feed the Simba
Three's a symbol like nobody
He's a symbol of what's safari
Pulled her ponytail to my body
She's the only girl that was smart e-
-nough to call me, Mr. Benjamin
in the middle of a wild party
Skin was cinnamon, I pound it harder
How come the only girls that are thought of
are the light ones? Well tonight then
We gon' do it, do it, do it for the dark ones
It's important, that you are more than
welcome to Tha, Carter IV and
Y'all enjoy it, I will go 'head
And I'll kiss y'all on y'all forehead
Out!
