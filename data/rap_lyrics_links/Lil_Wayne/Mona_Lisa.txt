[Intro: Kendrick Lamar]
I got a story to tell
You know that I cherish thee
Hope it ain't too many feelings involved

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I see, niggaz, in this, bitch
Stuntin, poppin, bottles
Gettin, drunk, with these, bitches
And when they leave they get followed
Fall a-sleep, with that, bitch
And really don't know much about her
Then she let us in, we take all of your shit
And when you wake up she help you try to find it, I love it
I be with bitches, that be with bitches
That be with niggaz with riches
I tell her "Get 'em," she say "I got you"
I say "No bitch, I say get 'em" (huh)
And they so pretty, and they hair lengthy
He hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word, we come through with AK's
It's a stick-up, she scream like a victim

[Lil Wayne]
Now you, feelin so silly
I smoke +Color Purple+, I'm up in here feelin like Celie
Ooh, nappy-ass dreads, what's that you say?
Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli
Ooh, you can get snaked, you can get faked
out by the bitch that you feelin
Cause you, thought that she was an angel
That bitch ain't no angel, I treat her halo like a frisbee
And you, tell her yo' business, she tell me yo' business
You tell that bitch what you feelin
All of the beans you be spillin
To you she lie through her teeth cavities, fillings
She know where you hide to tell me where it's hidden
She know when you're gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home, and take the specifics
And meanwhile the bitch is on vacation with him
so she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains
We find out addresses, and we don't leave messes
You'll only know that it's gone when you're checkin
Then your first thought is to start second-guessin
She say "What's wrong?" He say "Nothin, keep restin"
She say "What's missin?" "How you know somethin missin?"
He scratch his head, she say "Get back in bed"
Then she gave him some head, boy you can't trust them bitches
And then she say ooh

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
I see, niggaz, in this, bitch
Stuntin, poppin, bottles
Gettin, drunk, with these, bitches
Then when they leave they get followed
I be with bitches, that know the bitches
That's with the niggaz we followin
Get them on the line, stay two cars behind
And tell them hoes "Don't be so obvious!"
Mona, Lisa
Long hair, don't care
She handle the business and don't ever tell
She bite the bullet and cough up the shells
She tell 'em, "Ooh Daddy, let's go to your place"
And if he say yeah, then we meet 'em there
She feed him lies with his silverware
She don't want love, she just want her share

[Lil Wayne]
I, know a bitch named Liz
This nigga think she his cause she tell him that it is
So he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears
And then she tell me, and I be all ears
Then I go and tell my people, and they already knowin
And then I call Liz and she say he comin over
I say "Good girl, just remember what I told you"
She gave me the salute, I say "Girl, you're a soldier!"
We're waitin outside, watch him pull up
Walk up to the door, and right before he knock
She open the door naked, she left it unlocked
They started French kissin so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch
Music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down and I scared the piss out him
Piss a nigga off, put the gun to his frown
Nigga turn around, I ain't here to fuck around
I ain't here to fuck around, caught you with your pants down
You know what it is, put your fuckin hands up
Liz, that's enough, you could put your hands down
Then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her
She a good actress and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we're after
If Liz call you Daddy, she about to be a bastard, oh!
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me nigga
but think for me nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me nigga
I hope you alone like bankruptcy nigga
She pour you a drink, that drink on me nigga
She slip somethin in it, now thank for me nigga
Mona Lisa, I done painted the picture
Mo-Mona Lisa out the frame on these niggaz
Pussy got you out of character nigga
You fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
Take everything that you have 'til you don't even have an opinion
We have yo' attention
And now you're lookin down a barrel though nigga
Now she lookin for her pantyhose nigga
We just lookin for the casserole nigga
But she gon' show us where you stash it though nigga
Mona...

[Kendrick Lamar] + (Lil Wayne)
Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup
and a promise he gon' take her to the movie and the mall
Chillin with the Laker on the floor, fourth quarter
Four minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi lookin at 'em, both poppin up and take a picture
Uh, probably on a internet blog
In a minute he gon' be admittin that he love her on his mother
Man he wanna meet her mother by tomorrow
(Mona, Lisa) Pussy good enough
it got him sinnin in the walls
And he diggin in it like he livin in it
Make a new religion with it, man the nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in a pear tree
Sweet tone like a hummingbird, when she asked him
did he wanna make love in a yellow taxi
Never gave two fuck, jumped in the back seat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby
Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a Pit laughing
I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend and I'm all jazzy
Britney with the twin and the girl Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy
Bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me!
Better yet I wanna break up, don't you ask me
'bout no motherfuckin double standard, acting
Fuckin on another nigga, that's a negative alone
But you sucked his dick? That's just nasty!
Matter fact, bitch gimme yo' phone! {No!}
You fuckin with Wayne's? {No!} Bitch, gimme yo' phone!
{*BZZT*} {No! Let me, let me take this call real quick}
{*BZZT*} {"Like a lollipop"} He on your fuckin ringtone?!
Is that the shit that you do?
Touchin yourself, lookin at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watchin his interviews
I don't know what the fuck lately gotten into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder
Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma
Daycare after school and she never did charge her
You scandalous as fuck and I hope you blow up
You know what? I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber, I'm plannin on aimin
Goddamn it, you know that the damage is done
Bitch I'm emotional cause I'm in stress
I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
So in conclusion
Since you like rappers that's killin that pussy, I'm killin myself!

[Outro: Lil Wayne] + (Kendrick Lamar)
She say, ooh Daddy ooh (ooh, ooh) Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Ooh, fake smile (ooh, ooh) Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
She say, ooh, no emotion (ooh, ooh) Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Now he get the picture, Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, yeah
