[Intro: Future] + (Lil Wayne)
I'm lookin' for her
Astronaut
(Tunechi)
I'm lookin' for her
I'm lookin' for her
(Remix)
I'm lookin' for her
Yeah

[Verse 1: Future]
Is that her in the VIP line?
With the Vuitton and Yves Saint Laurent
Used to drive a Nissan now she in a Beamer
I don't want her cause she from the corner
And I heard that Beamer was a loaner
Her old man the owner
And I don't even drink Corona's
What type of drink you want huh?
On champagne forever, on dirty sprite forever
You can come sip with me if you'd like to change the weather
If you wanna live better, we can buy a crib wherever
Don't get too thirsty, get used to this cheddar
I wanna tell the world about you just so they can get jealous
And if you see her 'fore I do, tell her I wish that I've met her
Turn on the lights, I'm lookin' for her too
I heard she keep her promises and never turn on you
I heard she ain't gon' cheat and she gon' never make no move
I heard she be there anytime you need her, she come through
Turn on the lights

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
This dick is for you
I ask her is it true and she say "like a horseshoe"
She got that nigga name covered, that's a war wound
She lay me on my back and ride this dick like vroooom
Then I...

[Chorus: Future]
Turn on the lights, I'm lookin' for her
I'm lookin' for her, I'm lookin' for her
Turn on the lights
I'm lookin' for her, I'm lookin' for her
I'm lookin' for her, I'm lookin' for her

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Tell her I skate
And shawty down to earth, but bitch I need my space
And she gone ride this dick, I had a long day
She say cum me anywhere you want, I give her Santa Claus face
We gon' turn up tonight, that pussy feel new
But we been fucking way before I went to Rikers Island
And now she got a man, I think he gayer than a stylist
I wish we were both single like a couple dollars
And when we get together she be on that Miley Cyrus
So we eat each other up like some Somalians
She know I got a girl, but she keep this shit a thousand
Whenever we together she don't ever ask about us
She just be like this pussy is for you
I say come and eat this bone, and stop eating dog food
And she got that nigga name covered, that's a war wound
And she lay me on my back and then she fuck me like boom
Then I...

[Chorus: Future]
Turn on the lights, I'm lookin' for her
I'm lookin' for her, I'm lookin' for her
Turn on the lights
I'm lookin' for her, I'm lookin' for her
I'm lookin' for her, I'm lookin' for her

[Outro: Lil Wayne]
Tell her I skate, I ain't go no worries
No Frank Ocean, I'm straight
Tunechi
Tell 'em I'm straight, Tunechi

[Outro: Future]
Tell her I been lookin' for her with a flashlight
You can't tell her, tell her nothing cause I got my cash right
And tell her if she honest, she promise to stay true
Make sure when you tell her, tell her we goin' past the moon
Turn on the lights, I"m lookin' for her
