[Lil' Wayne]
(Gibberish noises)

Look, look, look
I pass with the top off like my car was named Lil' Kim
The lil pimp hopped out wrist lookin like a skittles blimp
Do not introduce me to your chic, that'll get her flip
I'ma try not to mention that I'm rich, but it'll slip
I really whipped the Z doin' a hundred and thirty
Come back doin 25 in a hunter Excursion
Open mouth and it'll beam like the sun is emergin 
When I'm out, women scream like they thumbin a virgin
Hummers be swervin like I'm passin y'all in speeding go-carts 
She think she look like a basketball season score chart
Hotter than a damn blow torch, you see me sizzlin
When your freak be missin, I got her twurkin n she be whistlin 
Piece be glistenin every time it get a light reaction 
Despite the braggin my chest brighter than Michael Jackson
BMW motorcycle drag racing dawg
That playas raw call'em "Lil' Wayne the Don"

[Chorus 2X: Lil' Wayne]
When we come through you know how we do, dog
(shoo, shoo) up the insterstate with the roof off
We be shinin in diamonds very blue, dog
Just the life in the ice'll make ya cool off

[B.G.]
Damn, I like to rep, I like to shine, I like to look good

[Lil' Wayne]
B.Geezy let them niggas know

[B.G.]
I come through in somethin new, hoes hollerin' "Look at him!"
That be the Hot Boy they call "Bling Bling Slim"
Park the whip crooked, grab the heat, jump out
Everybody lookin and sayin "damn he iced out"
The chain I got on costs more than your dream house
Presidential Roley, don't even want talk about
Say whodi look at your bitch - she drooling from the mouth
Wanna ride wit lil' B.G. and wildout
Don't trip, let her come dip wit me dawg
I share them lips wit Weezy 'til she get locked jaws
I'm a fool wit it, niggas know but don't want admit it
It's cool, long as you respect me, I'm chillin
Cross the line I draw for ya - it's a killin
It's gonna be click, clack blucka, blucka brain spillin
Until then I'm reppin, Stuntin flossed out
You see me if you up north and I'm down south

[Chorus]

[B.G.]
Nigga don't think I changed, I grew up doin good
Still: fuck, chill, and get my hair cut in the hood
Never forget where I come from, I'm too real 
Never for get the days I had to get it how I live
But it's better now; I'm on another level now
I got cheddar now; I got my shit together now
I'm livin swell nigga, I'm givin hoes hell nigga
My broad is in order, I refuse to fail nigga
Benzos, Beamers, and Bentleys
Man I'm ballin, go to a dice game wit a hundred G's
Lose it - laugh about it - nigga like me don't miss it
Make a phone call get my bitch to come bring me 50
True that, it's all gravy, I get that there from Baby 
When I struggle niggas love me - now they can't take me
But as long as they don't fuck wit me - I don't worry bout'em
But if they fuck wit me - you gone have to worry bout'em

[Chorus]

(Gibberish noises sounding like the chorus)

Just the life in the ice'll make ya cool off
