[First Verse-B.G.]
A nigga tried to test my nuts
Clown thought I was soft
Drumma had ten clicks
So you know I had to knock his head off
Caught him slipping on the darkside
Had to do a walk-by
Walked up on then popped him up
Watched that fucken clown die
Bitch, Don't try to play me
Or you'll push up daisies
Baby Gangsta took you to war
Off wit yo head G
Don't ever underestimate
The 40 is off
Then you roll down for murder
And my game is cold
Situation bout this nigga
Make at a thousand plugs and slow
He shouldn't killed me for his dick
I'm gon' play him like a hoe
The nigga deserved to be killed
Tried to play me like im not real
But I'ma pop a Red then chop ya
Yes, that cap got peeled
I had no motha fucken love
Man I'm down to plug
'Cuz I'm a gangsta off Valence
A true fucken thug

We slangin ou-r dope 
Clocken much, much dollars
Gettin' paid up in pace
Twenty-Fo by the hour
Keep my pockets on stroll
And you know

I can never be no faker
'Cuz my game is to go...
Just to Eagle Street
Hussler - I can never lose my self
'Cuz them niggas in the Grove
I know they all got my back
Just the 17 - thang

So throw yo hands up
So I can knock out all you hoes
You runnen 'round talken - you's a slugged up nigga
But when I get through
You just a bone-mouth nigga
Try'na explain to them everything
But they don't understand a word
Blood flyin everywhere
Was all they they seen
And all they heard
So you better fill your mouth
With that fake retainer
Messin 'round with a villian
I'ma put you in somethang
So take my advice
And see yo way at the Grove

And you die like a stove
