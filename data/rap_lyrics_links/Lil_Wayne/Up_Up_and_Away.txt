[Lil Wayne]
Up up and away
Up up and away
Up, up up and away
Uhh, yeah
I'm about to go

Up up and away, dick in your mouth, fuck what you say
You sweet as pie, a muffin and cake
Dick in her mouth, I'm fuckin her face
Live for the night, sleep in the day
You high as fuck, sleep it away
I am a dog you should keep in the gate
Pussy, hmm, how sweet is the taste?
Gun to your head, what you peepin to say?
Weezy bitch, I'm deep in the space
Floatin away like a leaf in the lake
I'm gone, like, delete and erase
Talk that shit, I walk that shit
Pills, weed, all that shit
If the bitch is bad I'ma call that bitch
Get pussy, ass, all that shit
Uhh, what they talkin 'bout?
I go hard, they soft as a couch
I'm runnin them in, and walkin them out
Cars so cold I park in the house
Flows so raw, this beat is pregnant
Flow so tight, it's yeast infected
Kill 'em all when they least expect it
Money talk, Lisa Leslie
Y.M., C.M.B. connection
Rappers is what I eat for breakfast
Runnin up in my sheets is sexy
If she ain't fuckin she can exit
Gun tucked in the waist
I bust in your face
I ain't got nuttin to say
But, up up and away

[Chorus: Lil Wayne]
Up up and away, up up and away
Man I'm so high, I'll come down in a couple of days
Up up and away, up up and away
Man I'm so high, I'll come down in a couple of days
(Weezy!) Yeah (Where you goin?) Up
(You're goin a little bit too far) Haha~!

[Lil Wayne]
Ain't this a bitch?
I just saw my bitch kiss a bitch
You're lucky I don't kill yo' ass
But you can still get pistol whipped
Sharper than a pencil tip
Bitch don't even twitch your lip
40 cal' with the extended clip
Ain't gon be no incident
Skinny jeans, red Vans
Skully on, money long
Her mouth is like my house
so I guess you can say I'm cum'n home
You're whylin out, then we're ridin out
Now you're +Hidin+ out, +Honeycomb+
I'm laughin to the bank
like I just broke my fuckin funny bone
Haha! What's really good five?
I'm over here smokin that really good vibe
Eyes so high I look blind
But the stove on my waist cook time
I be with niggaz that took lives
And niggaz that'll take it outside
And niggaz that'll take it to your crib
take the baby out the crib, and rape the housewives
I'm gon' get so wasted they gon' have to carry me out this bitch
I took over this rap shit, these rappers are just hostages
Let's cut to the chase
My bitch no habla ingles
But I ain't got nothin to say
But, up up and away - uhh~!

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
Up up and away, up up and away
Up up and away, up up and away
Up up and away, up up and away

[Lil Wayne]
Fuck with a nigga if you fuck with a nigga
Fuck with me, good luck to the nigga
Straps On Deck, so fuck that nigga
Leave you lookin like lightning struck that nigga
Stacks On Deck, I'm rich as shit
I'm callin my bitch the shit
Walkin 'round on my fuckin shit
I done did everything on my bucket list
Fuck that shit, I'm superbad
I don't give a hoover damn
Man, I son all these niggaz
They should have a stupid tan
Ha, President Carter
Vote for Lil Wayne
Sit yo' five dollar ass down
'fore I make change
I'm pumping your brakes
I'm jumpin the gates
And I ain't got nothin to say
But, up up and away

[Outro]
(Weezy! Where you goin?)
(You're goin a little bit too far) UHH!
Up up and away, up up and away
Up up and away, up up and away
Up up and away, up up and away... I say
Up up and away, up up and away
Up up and away, up up and away
Man I'm so high, I'll come down in a couple of days
Up up and away, up up and away
Man I'm so high, I'll come down in a couple of days
(Come here... I like you)
(You'll have to tickle me or somethin)
(I need to smoke a cigarette)
