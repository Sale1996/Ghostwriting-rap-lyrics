{"All around the world, girls all around the world" <- Slick Rick}

[Lloyd]
I just wanna be your man, girl
{"This goes out to girls all around the world" <- Slick Rick}
(Jasper, I see you) So I, gotta make you understand, girl
(WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!)

[Verse One]
It's the way you flip your hair
and those stylish clothes you wear
When you walk into the room
all my patnas stop and stare at you
   {"All around the world, girls all around the world"}
   {"This goes out to girls all around the world" <- Slick Rick}
But they just wanna use you up
   {"All around the world, this goes out to girls all around the world"}
It's the tattoo on your back 
and that brand new Louie bag
with the matchin hiiiigh heels 
I can't help this, girl your swag's the truth
          {"All around the world, girls all around the world"}
Aw baby.. {"This goes out to girls all around the world" <- Slick Rick}
And I just wanna give my love, ohh
          {"All around the world, this goes out to girls all around the world"} 

[Chorus]
(Girl I) can't get you off my mind, you're like my favorite song (song)
Just want to turn you on and rock you all night long
'Cause I-iiIIIIIi-igh, oh IiiiI-igh..
I just wanna be your man 
(Just wanna be your man, ohh)

[Verse Two]
Just to smell your per-fume
got me goin out my head
See me comin, see I'm goin
Never met someone as bad, as yoooooooooou, oh
   {"All around the world, girls all around the world"}
   {"This goes out to girls all around the world" <- Slick Rick}
Since you're my favorite girl
   {"All around the world, this goes out to girls all around the world"}
I know just what you need
to make you look complete
This platinum wedding raing
'cause soon I got a thang for yoooooou, yo
I'ma take you around the worrrr-hahld, oh baby
   {"All around the world, this goes out to girls all around the world"}

[Chorus]

[Lil Wayne]
HAHAH, yeah!
Okay, I'm thinkin of a master plan..
Nah, I'm lyin, shawty on my mind
Shawty like a fryin, pan
and I ain't got nothin but sweat inside my hand
So I dig into my pocket all my money's spent
But I don't need a cent, 'cause shawty's priceless
I tell like this, I been - {"All around the world" <- Slick Rick}
So baby I can take you -   {"All around the world" <- Slick Rick}
Okay I roll up, this is the hold-up, it's Young Money
Man, shawty made me smile when ain't a damn thang funny
Heh, but still don't nothin move but the money
So baby, if I move, then we move with the money - which is my favorite dish
But if I taste you, that'll probably switch
Heh, and then we will probably switch
Now I'm walkin out the street, whistlin thisss

[Chorus]
