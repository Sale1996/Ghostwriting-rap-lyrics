[Lil Wayne]
With my first hundred G's, bought my momma house
Bitch don't try to suck my dick if you got cotton mouth
Watch these snitches, man these rats think they Mighty Mouse
In the kitchen, Arm & Hammer, just the right amount
Got the dope spot poppin', dope spot jumpin'
Car parked by itself, robot stuntin'
And it's voice activated, I just tell it somethin'
I ain't even gotta press a button
Viper with the rally stripes, I donât eat no Rally's
I don't eat my words nigga, I don't eat no salad
I got too much on my plate, I got too much on my palate
Never seen my car before, it's like a unicorn in traffic
Too much fuckin' talent; rap Shakespeare, go Hamlet
You other boys could kiss the game goodbye, be romantic
Please don't worry Nancy, all my weed is organic
If my children end up smokin', I'll whip they ass if they don't pass it
Hol' up... I just got a package
I let my bitch test it with flyin' colors, passed it
Burnin' money fast like fire on the plastic
You a dead man walkin', throw some tires on your casket
They say niggas in wheelchairs is half dead as it is
I still keep the heat on me, attitude cavalier
Boy I think your whole clique's Summerâs Eve, Massengill
Monastat 7, Vagisil
Uh, and my name don't need no adjectives
And my flow don't need no ad-libs; the booth the battlefield
Flag red like I'm Russian, call me Vladimir
Took a picture with the pistol, gave it rabbit ears
These niggas got fast careers, fast as Batmobiles
My bitches got sex appeal, they like sex and pills
For reals, I'm sorry if you hate you
And I'm sorry for the wait too

[2 Chainz]
Yeeeah, 2 Chainz~!

Boom! It's my shot like Biloxi (woo!)
Even my shadow don't trust me (damn)
Big dog in this shit like a husky (true)
285, twenty pounds of musty (tell 'em)
Stopped by the spot, had to serve Pooh Bear (okay)
He buy one, I front him one so I left two there (errt~!)
In a two seater, pull up poppin' 2Pac (I did)
Didn't have a safe so I stashed it in my tube sock (uhh)
Eat so much Benihana, I need nunchucks (whoa)
You just a old nigga always sayin' "Big bruh" (damn)
You a bad bitch always sayin' "Big daddy" (damn)
You a real nigga talkin' 'bout you want a selfie
Uh, a baby bottle with my shit in
And my role model was a kingpin (dat right)
I say "Let's work", he say "Let's work"
Let your next work be your best work (errt! errt! errt!)

[Lil Wayne]
And it's that "Sorry 4 The Wait 2"
Mm, and I'm so sorry for the wait too
From New Orleans to the A, TRU
You test my homies, we ace you
Tity, these niggas monkeys in ape suits
I got a city, got a ocean, got a lake view
She took some shots 'til she shot down a Grey Goose
This that "Sorry 4 The Wait Deuce"
