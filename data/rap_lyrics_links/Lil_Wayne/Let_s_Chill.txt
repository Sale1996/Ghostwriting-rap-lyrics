[Lil Twist]
Let's chill
Let's settle down
That's what I wanna do
Just me and you

Let's chill
Let's settle down
That's what I wanna do
Just me and you

Let's chill

[Lil Twist]
Let's chill baby(where?)
We can go to mars
Let's chill baby(when?
How bout tomorrow
We can chill wherever you want to
Like pluto
I'm a rockstar I been the places you know
Next door to weezy
Cause you noe that boy a marshin
And you'll be my gina girl
And I'll be your martin
No carmony?
Smooth vibe like a harmony
I'm on my way out the do'
And I hope you think of joinin me
And plus you add the double t's to my twist
Without those two I'd be wis
Now who is that miss
I dunno
But he is so lame
It's lil twist on top of ery main
And on top of my game

[Lil Twist]
Let's chill
Let's settle down
That's what I wanna do
Just me and you

Let's chill
Let's settle down
That's what I wanna do
Just me and you

Let's chill

[Mack Maine]
Shawty you know that we can chill tonight
Or we can chill in the morning
Love to wake up and see you yawnin
I make sure that you have
Breakfast in bed
And a lexus in red
We can go to texas instead
But down in new orleans tonight
Aite
So we can juss spend it for eternity
Girl I hope we stay together for eternity
And ooooh girl you look so good without ya make-up on
I got a love jones in my bones for ya skin tone
And when my phone ring I hope it's you askin can we

[Lil Twist]
Let's chill
Let's settle down
That's what I wanna do
Just me and you

Let's chill
Let's settle down
That's what I wanna do
Just me and you

Let's chill

[Lil Wayne]
Like zero below
Had to introduce her to my hero below
Why waste time says my frank meuller
And we can swim around and juss drown in the cooler
Baby we can chill like ice I'm the jeweler
Wrap around yo ass like a braclet or a hu-la-hoop
The group
Is young mula
But that's another subject
See right now I'm tryna budget
Yo situation
Girl I'm like a mental patient
Lookin for an invitation
To your destination
Girl I like your presentation
And I like your dedication
I ain't talkin ameration
Girl I'm talkin mezmeration

[Lil Twist]
Let's chill
Let's settle down
That's what I wanna do
Just me and you

Let's chill
Let's settle down
That's what I wanna do
Just me and you

Let's chill
