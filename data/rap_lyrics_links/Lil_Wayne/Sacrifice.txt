[Mack Maine]
Don't be scared now
I'll have you sweating so hard you'll need 3 or 4 towels
After that, all I need is 3 or 4 showers
Just to get the blood off in 3 or 4 hours
Then come to through your hood and get like, 3 or 4 cowards
You think your bison like you play for Howard
But you's a duck like Howard
I make you fall like the towers
I cut your arm off and tell you to reach
Then I cut your tongue off and I tell you to speak
My niggas in a circle in the middle of a bonfire
They quick to become arsonists to set you on fire
The flesh start to smell, but who gives a fuck?
Heaven or hell nigga, you need to pick one
Brrrp, stick 'em, now you become a victim
Yeah, you become a victim, yeah, you become a victim
I'm evil like three 6's nigga minus the mafia
And ain't no brace on my shit, nigga, ain't no stoppin' a
Young cannibal, cut you like a cantalope
I mistreat bodies, for breakfast I eat bodies

[Chorus]
You could smell fear in the distance [? ] All of their lives
Come with us home, better witness their, Sacrifice
We could take your body to the project for a sacrifice
We could take your body to the project for a sacrifice
We could take your body to the valley for a sacrifice
We could take your body to the valley for a sacrifice

[Lil Wayne]
It's Weezy F. Crazy
You scary ass rappers on the beat I'm wes craven
But I'm eastside till I reside in the grave
And you walk in my basement and see the bodies I'm saving
Blood bath flow, yes it's time for some bathing
Shotty with a drum and I'm a play it like a cadence
Invasion, I cook ya like the Asians
Put bread on ya head like a raisin
You a danish, you need glazing
Pardon me man, but I'm craving
I got you in the oven, but I'm waiting
I'm patient, for my patient
Yeah, There's a meeting in my kitchen
Shhh, there's rappers sleeping in my kitchen
Young money creatures
Kill your sweet ass then eat you motherfucker

[Chorus]
You could smell fear in the distance [? ] All of their lives
Come with us home, better witness their, Sacrifice
We could take your body to the project for a sacrifice
We could take your body to the project for a sacrifice
We could take your body to the valley for a sacrifice
We could take your body to the valley for a sacrifice

[Gudda Gudda]
We take your body for a motherfucking sacrifice
See you in hell bitch meet me in the afterlife
Minivan, duct tape, knife in my hand
Nigga, knife to your head, you're my sacrificial lamb
Nigga, I can smell blood like a hound, I see dead people
Paint the scene, I'm a leave a bunch of red people
Saddam, I bomb, I'm insane, Hussein
Assault rifle with the drum, nigga, with the blue flame
Blood on my glove, while I'm burying the witness
Cut your limbs off, I'm on my Jeffrey Dahmer sick shit
For real I'm I'll, we marching like the military
Coffins everywhere, this the rap cemetery
You niggas sweet, get ate like Ben N' Jerrys
You niggas very fairy
Tell frail better go and say your Hail Mary
Rocket launcher bitch, I'm a throw a Hail Mary
Young Gudda Biach

[Chorus]
You could smell fear in the distance [? ] All of their lives
Come with us home, better witness their, Sacrifice
We could take your body to the project for a sacrifice
We could take your body to the project for a sacrifice
We could take your body to the valley for a sacrifice
We could take your body to the valley for a sacrifice
