(Hook, One Republic)
I'm holdin on a rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearin what your say
But I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down, but waaait
Tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around

(Verse 1, Lil Wayne)
OK, I'm talkin' bout a
Good girl, gone bad
Crooked world, wrong path
Right Mom, wrong dad
I sing this song mad, but not mad enough to shoot you
But it just eats me up, like some barbecue from Luther's
In the morning with the roosters
On the corner with the boosters
And she's the fresh-cut and they're on her like sutures
And I wanna talk to her
But her momma has to school her
I wanna see her better
She's the weather of my future
I don't wanna see another hurricane
Baby you can kill the pain
If you just let me explain
Trust me I know what I'm sayin'
You will end up on the track of an on-coming train
Stuck in the passenger seat
Travelin' through the fast lane

(Verse 2, Bun B)
Well once upon a time, there was a mom and a dad
Who on the outside, had everything people wished they had
A beautiful daughter, two-story house, two-car garage
And a white picket-fence, wrapped around the front yard
See daddy was a doctor
And mommy was a banker
Mommy's job got outsourced
So now mommy's dranker
Daddy had a malpractice suit
Now he's a snorter
And all this shit is takin' place
right in front of the daughter
She says, Daddy what's wrong?
But he's just too high
Mommy what we gon' do?
She just get drunk and cry
Caught in the middle of two wrongs, tryin'a do right
Looking for answers all alone in the darkness of night
Shit ain't right

(Hook)
I'm holdin on a rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearin what your say
But I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down, but waaaait
Tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around
You say that it's too late to apologize
It's too laaaate
I said it's too late to apologize
it's too laaaate
