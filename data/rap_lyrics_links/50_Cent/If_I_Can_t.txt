Yea, ha ha, yea, yea

[Hook: 50 Cent]
If I can't do well, homey, it can't be done
Now I'ma let the champagne bottle pop
I'ma take it to the top
Fo sho I'ma make it hot, baby (baby)

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
I apply pressure to pussies that stuntin I pop
Stand alone squeezin my pistol I'm sure that I gotta
Now Peter Piper picked peppers, and Run rocked rhymes
Now 50 Cent, I write a lil bit but I pop nines
Tell niggaz, "Get they money right," cause I got mine
And I'm around quit playin nigga you can't shine
You gon be that next chump to end up in the trunk
After bein hit by the pump, is that what you want?
Be easy nigga, I lay your ass out
Be-lieve me nigga, thats whut I'm about, gangsta
You could find a nigga sittin on chrome
Hit the clutch, hit the gear, hit the gas and I'm gone (Yea!)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: 50 Cent] + (Dr. Dre)
I'm down for the action, he smart with his mouth so smack 'em
You holdin a strap, he might come back so clap 'em
React like a gangsta, die like a gangsta for actin
Cuz you'll get hit & homicide'll be askin, "Whut happened?"
OH NO look who crept in with the FO'FO'
20 inch rims sittin on LOW-PRO
Eastside, Westside niggaz ALL KNOW, I'm LO-CO
Even my mama said, "Something really wrong with my brain"
Niggaz dont rob me they know I'm down to die for my chain
G-UNIT! We get it poppin in the hood
G-UNIT! Muthafucka whuts good?
I'm waitin on niggaz to act like they dont know how to act
I had a sip of too much jack, I'll blow 'em off the map
With the mack, thinkin it's all rap
Til that ass get clapped and Doc say "It's a wrap"
(It's a wrap, nigga)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 50 Cent]
I been feelin I have to teach lessons to slow learners
Go head act up, get smacked in the head with the burner
I dont fight fair, I'm dirty-dirty
I'm from Southside Jamaica, Queens, nigga ya'heard me?
When streetlights come on niggaz blast the nines
Get locked up, they read books to pass the time
In the game there's up's and down's, so I stay on the grind
Niggaz on my dick more than my bitch, I stay on they mind
They aint nothin they could do to stop my shine
This is +God's Plan+ homey, this aint mine
I played the music loud so Grandpa called me a nuisance
And Grandma; who always gotta throw her two cents
I'm the drop out who made more more money than these teachers
Roofless/Ruthless like the Coupe but I come with more features
I am whut I am, you could like it or love it
It feels good to pull 50 grand and think nothin of it
Fuck it

[Hook] - repeat 2X

Uh huh, hood make it hot

Shady, ha ha
