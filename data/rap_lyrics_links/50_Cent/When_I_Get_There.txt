[Lloyd Banks]
Purple weed and cloudy skies
Audi rides, used to have to troop, but now we drive
Now we fly, ball, fly bitches, now we vibe
New movie starring yours truly, make the party live
The mommy's call me daddy
I call them now and then
Tell them bring their girlfriends, line them up and then shower
Then it's right back to usual
Excuse how I excuse you
You thought I was looking at you
I was looking through you
Through my eyes I see things clearer
Could it be my Bentley nearer
Gammer under chinchilla
Chill the fuck out 'fore we kill ya
I'm no where near familiar
Live is realer when you're speeding, weeding
Locking house you need, my reality for the evening (Evening)
When you're at the top, the bottom calls
Every summer body drops, still right out there by the mall
Pop my bands and buy it all
Put my hands in front of coals
Lot of grands than I'm involved
Problem man, I'll get it solved
Spick and span, no problem

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
Weed it up, tear it down,
That's how we roll (That's how we roll)
Devil wanna take me now
but I ain't going (I ain't going), too many already down,
Feel like I owe 'em, front your head now then your pounds
Show up to no one
When I get to the top (The top)
All way to the top (The top)
I'mma shit on you then climb back down
Just so I can spit on you
It's pitiful (It's pitiful)
The shit they do, when you get through

[Lloyd Banks]
They used to count a nigga out
Remember that to this day
haven't seen me since I made it
Rather have it this way
Hung up my Jersey for a minute, now I'm back in the play
Back in that zone where I'm snapping, rapping like back in the day
in New York city and now California
Styling on you skinny nigga from around the corner
Then found the ?sauna? marijuana in my 2k bomber
Benz or recline, man, I arm her with my rear persona
and riot armor, work magic, don't make me try it on ya
Allakhazam, cabaam, shazaam, now take cover fast as ya can
Man, fuck you sucka niggas and your RIP tatts
Southside, sleep, breath and eat that, we back
I had it hard, don't call me lucky, call me lots of money
My flow ain't from this time, more like two thousand twenty
Bitch, take the space up, back the fuck up I'mma need some room
You know the order, bag 'em, tag 'em, let the G's run through 'em

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
Weed it up, tear it down,
That's how we roll (That's how we roll)
Devil wanna take me now
but I ain't going (I ain't going), too many already down, 
Feel like I owe 'em, front your head now then your pounds
Show up to no one
When I get to the top (The top)
All way to the top (The top)
I'mma shit on you then climb back down
Just so I can spit on you
It's pitiful (It's pitiful)
The shit they do, when you get through
