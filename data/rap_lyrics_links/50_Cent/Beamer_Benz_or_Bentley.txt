[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
Beamer, Benz or Bentley; Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Beamer, Benz or Bentley - my jeans are never empty bitch
Beamer, Benz or Bentley; Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Beamer, Benz or Bentley - your schemin don't affect me

[Lloyd Banks]
I'm fresh, I'm fly, I'm so damn high
More than 500 horses when I roll by
I'm calm, I'm cool, e'rything brand new
I don't handcuff, you can get the whole damn crew
Get in my Beamer, Benz or Bentley; Beamer, Benz or Bentley
Beat it I bet she let me, she been fiendin since she met me
I'm the coolest shit especially when I'm throwin on my Gretzky
Got my S-S-Smith and Wessie to protect me so respect me
This is heavy new Bentley, color vanilla and cherry
Andretti or Pirelli, make a movie out the ghettie
Wear my ring and my confetti, I'm Kobe Bryant ready
Pink Ros√© and chronic smelly while I'm stumblin out the telly
I'm so fly, I'm so ferry and the way I flow is very
Ginsu or machete, when my pencil move it's deadly
Platinum band, platinum bezzie, make a straight girl out a lezzie
Magazine, mac, desi, keep my windows like the prezzie
Press a button and I'm stuntin, my roof look like it's duckin
Meter go 200-somethin and my trunk do wonders bumpin
I am not the one for chumpin, I will ratchet out and slump him
Dump him, nigga you better off dead, ya money red

[Interlude: Juelz Santana, Lloyd Banks]
[Juelz] I'm fresh, I'm fly, I'm always high (always high)
[Juelz] Got your bitch wavin at me when I roll by (I roll by)
[Banks] I'm calm, I'm cool, e'rything brand new
[Banks] I don't handcuff, you can get the whole damn crew

[Chorus] - begins with "Get in my"

[Juelz Santana]
Whether Beamer, Benz or Bentley I be movin, I be movin
Makin movies, Tom Cruise'n, if it's action then I'm shootin
Pockets fat, neck studded/Studdard, boy my nickname should be +Ruben+
My Columbian connect told me the Mexicans have moved it
And he know just how I get it so we 'bout to introduce him
Got a girl named Cigar, I call her that because she Cuban
Got a black chick that be boostin, got a white girl that be boothin
Gotta watch her cause she use it but she fuck me like she's stupid
And she always ready, to give me that Becky
Last time it was so good I almost crashed my Bentley
Hit the club, ordered bottles, see them sparks in the sky
will have this whole bitch lookin like the 4th of July
But if you pussies get to frontin and the pushin lead to shovin
We just bustin and we leavin like it's nothin (it's nothin)
If it ain't the Gucci or the Louie then it's Polo or it's Rugby
And this bitch I brought with me, she be baggin bitches for me

[Chorus] - begins with "In my"

[Interlude]

[Lloyd Banks]
I got a girl named Kima, and Kima like Christina
Baby three don't make a crowd, it make the sex seem meaner
I just wanna get between her, turn her to a screamer
Then it's one-two, I'm through, see ya
I'll scoop her in my..

[Chorus]
