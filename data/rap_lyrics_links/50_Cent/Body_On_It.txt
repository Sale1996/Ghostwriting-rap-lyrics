[Intro: skit]
"Police search for clues on the Q-111 bus where two people were shot, one fatally."
  "We heard like a few shots ring out, and uh, you know 
   by living in neighborhoods, familiar with those sounds we knew it was gunshots.
   So automatically y'know we start taking cover 
   cause we didn't know which direction they were coming from."
"Police say it all started in South Jamaica about 2-and-a-half miles 
 away from the shooting on the bus at Jamaica Station."
   "I was trying to get away from the area, after the first shot.
    It was very traumatizing to me, like I've seen this happen a lot of times.
    Didn't wanna be involved.
    I did not wanna be, that person that get a stray bullet or nothing like that."
"Police have arrested a 34 year-old man.
 They believe he is responsible for both shooting incidents.
 They also recovered a handgun.
 He was arrested not far from here near Jamaica Station.
 In Jamaica Queens, Zack Fink, New York 1."

It's "The Big 10"
It's, it's been ten years since "50 Cent is the Future"
Psh, I'm tired as a muh'fucker man

{"What you want me to be, I've tried to see"}

[50 Cent]
Yeah bitch I got my second wind, you could pretend I ain't the shit
I'm guilty I'm guilty, yeah I'm filthy fuckin rich
I'm strapped Your Honor, new mac, my armor
Point blank, matchin my bullet-proof persona
New version of Dahmer, pussy-eatin piranha
My tongue touch her flesh, your bitches say I'm the best
Them crackers say I'm racial, wait a cotton-pickin minute!
Now I'm racial, cause I done put "cotton-pickin" in it
Put a knot on your fuckin head, yeah that'll happen first
I'll put a dot on your fuckin head, you end up in a hearse
They say I play mind games, warrior mindframe
These bitch niggaz, always forget to say my name
Go 'head, I want you to, you four, I'm onto you
I'm so strategic you wouldn't believe it
And they know it, every time I come around
Pit stop and they tend to quiet down
Gotta know about me

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
My nine got a extended clip on it
My Tec got all kinda shit on it
Inf' beam, hollow tips, rubber grip on it
Night vision through the sight when I grip on it
My nine got a extended clip on it
My Tec got all kinda shit on it
My pound got a body on it, body on it
My man put a body on it, body on it

[50 Cent]
I read a blog
They said I ain't got it, I still got it, oh Lord
Look who's gonna meet the edge of my sword
I'm takin off now bitch, all aboard
If you wanna ride; fuck it, let's ride
It seems like, principle livin's startin to fade
Even in a gangsta's life, niggaz is snakes
No loyalty, rats rattin on members of their gang
Funny they were family before the pigs came

[Chorus]

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Yeah~! This one right here marks the decade of hot shit
If a nigga say I fell off, all I want you to do is ask him when
What they gon' say, what, the "Curtis" album?
Okay so #1's not good enough
I gave you "Ayo Technology" that was #1
"I Get Money," that wasn't hot?
So tell me when I fell off? Yeah
When I gave you motherfuckers what you asked for, with "Before I Self Destruct"
you looked at me and was like, 'We cool Fif'!'
You know why? Cause I won too much in front of you niggaz
That's why, but it's cool
I take a break, I come back, so hot you can't deny it
It's your boy 50
This one right here is for the haters, for real
I want you to eat a dick; don't suck a dick, eat a dick
Chew it, hahahaha
