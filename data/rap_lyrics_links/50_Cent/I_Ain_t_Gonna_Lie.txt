[Intro: Robbie Nova]
Uh! Oh yeah! I just wanna! Still love you girl
And I'm not 'gon lie girl, I just wanna, I just wanna
Oh girl! 

[Chorus: Robbie Nova]
I could take you to dinner girl, but I ain't 'gon lie
I just wanna fuck you baby
Go to the movie girl, but I ain't 'gon lie
I just wanna fuck you girl
See I could take you shoppin girl but I ain't 'gon lie
I just wanna fuck you baby
Or I could feel you head up girl, but I ain't 'gon lie
I just wanna fuck you girl

[Verse One: 50 Cent]
Nigga really wanna get to know you girl, see many things I wanna show you girl
See anything I guess I owe you girl, Louboutin's, movin on
'Fore the sun comes up then the top comes down, find out what the white Rolls Royce about
Run the white Air's on extra clear, like James Brown a nigga do it like a +Sex Machine+
I got a hot, wheel, fetish, I pull up in some mean shit
Sex, drugs, rock and roll, Charlie Sheen bitch!
See me +Toot It And Boot It+ on my Obama shit
Money ain't no tellin how much I'm a get
I spit bars have the hood in a frenzy
Fuck around take a chain like Lindsay
Paparazzi takin pictures of my Fendi
Catch me in Prada, or maybe Asata
Just another beautiful day in .L.A.
And I'm a New Yorker professional shit talker HUH!!! 
I see niggas is stressin
And I'm straight so I'm guessin, I'm above the recession 

[Chorus: Robbie Nova]
I could take you to dinner girl, but I ain't 'gon lie
I just wanna fuck you baby
Go to the movie girl, but I ain't 'gon lie
I just wanna fuck you girl
See I could take you shoppin girl but I ain't 'gon lie
I just wanna fuck you baby
Or I could feel you head up girl, but I ain't 'gon lie
I just wanna fuck you girl

[Verse Two: 50 Cent]
It takes just a little bit of my conversation when I talk
To make you clear fo' sho' that I'm that nigga in New York
Shorty now lay down, put your head back
I put your legs backstroke and move your bed back
When we get to them back shots, shorty throw it back
When you back it up, that mean, I like that
Let me guess I turn you on, I turn you on I bet
We just gettin started and everything soakin wet
This pussy good she ain't worried about the rent this month
This pussy must have went and bought this bitch that Benz out front
For me it's nothin I'm just fuckin for the fuck of it
But shorty actin like what we just did some other shit
It can't be, it could be ok maybe she's a good girl
Attracted to me and things from my world
Temptations are great
One ten is bracelets that worth eight carats are ten times eight

[Chorus: Robbie Nova]
I could take you to dinner girl, but I ain't 'gon lie
I just wanna fuck you baby
Go to the movie girl, but I ain't 'gon lie
I just wanna fuck you girl
See I could take you shoppin girl but I ain't 'gon lie
I just wanna fuck you baby
Or I could feel you head up girl, but I ain't 'gon lie
I just wanna fuck you girl

[Outro: 50 Cent]
Why should I waste my time lyin? The fuck would I be doin
Look let me tell you somethin right
If the bitch 'gon roll, or bitch 'gon get the joggin or walkin
Or however you know she wanna, you know exit
Bitch get! You know what I'm sayin and....
If a bitch came in, on BB's she 'gon leave on BB's I don't give a fuck
Get her that Chris Louboutins, Alexander McQueen, DaVinci
We could put you on all that fly shit, bitch the shit stayin in the closet
I'm a meet another bitch wear a size seven and a half
Fuck with me see if I'm bullshittin!
