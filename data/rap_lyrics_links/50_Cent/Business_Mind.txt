[Hayes]
While rubbin elbows in the hills of high society
I look back on my life and realized the hood lied to me
Built the bullshit, sense of pride inside of me
On the rise to fly a car, hatin on varieties

[50 Cent]
Look, I don't need no bitch niggaz surroundin me
Get caught you better stick to the codes that you provided B
If you don't plead the 5th you get your whole shit split
So call kingpins, get real money to snitch

[Hayes]
I know it sounds hard to believe this bullshit
but sometimes you need money to see who you cool with
See niggaz hustle hard and cop 'em a few whips
Then end up poppin niggaz they used to be cool with
I'm a

[50 Cent]
Street entrepreneur, condo connoisseur
Furs suede, my car is decor
Nigga I been the boss, I employ my boys
And show 'em a bunch of shit they never seen before

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I got a business mind - that block is mine
That brick and them Glocks is mine
I got a business mind - that drop is mine
These knots and this watch is mine
I got a business mind - you can't stop my shine
A nigga got a World Guinness Book rhyme
I got a business mind - and I pop my nine
You fuck around find out in time

[50 Cent]
I got a short fuse so if by some chance I get annoyed
The button gets pressed and your life gets destroyed
Got niggaz that'll do this shit just cause they bored
Man I ain't even got to tell niggaz what for

[Hayes]
You think you cool but I swat your type of fly
Yeah you cross your T's but you forgot your I's/eyes
That's why I out-charisma ya, I could out-business ya
Intimidate ya with success, I catch the interest of

[50 Cent]
Corporate America, gangstas we got 'em tearin up
We only want the money, no reason to be scared of us
We feel the life that we live is unfair to us
America's an oven, you got to break bread for us

[Hayes]
"Go hard or die soft" is what was said to us
So if it's gunplay you gon' get shot instead of us
Crackers be thinkin they one step ahead of us
I say shit like that to let 'em know that I'm aware of it

[50 Cent]
Keep accountants to countin, I got lawyers to share kid
Babes to clean up my mess, go make the bed bitch
They said death or jail is what's ahead of us
So when they ask me what I thought, all I could say is I'm a

[Hayes]
Street entrepreneur, condo connoisseur
Fur is suede, and my car is decor
Nigga I been a boss, I employ my boys
Matter fact, I don't even wanna chat no more~!

[Chorus]
