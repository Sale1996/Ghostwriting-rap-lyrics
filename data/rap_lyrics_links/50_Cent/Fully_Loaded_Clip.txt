[Intro]
High-speed Ferrari movement
3rd lane switchin' lanes, whuddup?
Brooklyn, whuddup?
Far Rock, whuddup?
 
[Chorus]
While Jay and Beyonce was *Mm mm*, kissin'
I was cookin' one-thousand grams in my kitchen
While Nas was tellin' Kelis, "I love you boo"
I was shinin' my nine, ya know how I do
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on dat shit
I got-I got a fully loaded clip
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on dat shit (Yeah)
I got-I got a fully loaded clip
 
[Verse 1]
You wann' problem wit' me? - No problem, it's all good
I ain't fresh out the hood, I'm still in the hood
Black rims, black hemi, nigga see me when ya see me
I appear and disappear wit' the heata like Houdini
Dat parry and bullshit'll git cha azz popped
Don't believe me - ask Fab, they got his head shot
I'm in the cut like germs, I do durrt like worms
Smoke weed, now I'm sure, nigga it's my turn
I fire on ya azz, dem hollow-tips burn, baby burn
I'm screamin' "Fuck the cops!", ride 'round wit' my glock
There's my pistol on my bitch, nigga fuck dat box!
Dat's how P. got knocked, dat's a jewel I drop
But you ain't peep dat nigga, go 'head, repeat dat nigga
You might learn a lil' summin' if you learn to stop frontin'
I make it look easy on three piece bb's, rollin' locc-in'
Up early wit' the dopemane
 
[Chorus]
When Janet and Jermaine was *Mm mm*, kissin'
I was baggin' one-thousand grams in my kitchen
When Puffy just tellin' Kim, "I love you boo"
I was shinin' my nine, ya know how I do
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on dat shit
I got-I got a fully loaded clip
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on dat shit
I got-I got a fully loaded clip
 
[Verse 2]
At the dice game I bet it all, you hear wha I'm sayin'?
Take grand, I form betta nigga I ain't playin'
I'm trynna git it, holla at me if ya wit' it
And lace up the chuckas, we can rob these mothafuckas
My stomach is growlin', they say dat I'm wyllin'
I'm doin' my numbas, I'm gittin' violent
They hearin' me rap and they think dat I'm playin'
Till they see the barrel and they see the flame
I need full co-operation man, give us the chain
The watch, the ring and the grill - we ain't playin'
I fire dat thang, it sound insane
Holla, I got dat nose candi mayne
   
[Chorus]
When Jeezy and Keisha was *Mm mm*, kissin'
I was baggin' one-thousand grams in my kitchen
When Trina was tellin' Wayne, "I love you boo"
She was just runnin' games, she told Buck dat too
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on dat shit
I got-I got a fully loaded clip
I got a fully loaded clip, I be on dat shit
I got-I got a fully loaded clip
 
[Outro w/ ad-libin "I got-I got fully loaded clip"]
Now nigga, lemme show ya how I do this right here!
Now, the rugger hold 16!
I put 16 in the clip, I put it in - I cock dat!
One in the head, 'till it fell!
I put anutha one in it the clip, I put it back!
Dat was big wit' all dat, let the bullets breathe!
I need a fully loaded clip!
