[Chorus 2x - Young Buck (D-Tay)]
Why?
These Niggaz Want Me Dead (Betta' Watch Yo Step)
Puttin' Prices On My Head (Cuz I Cock My Shit, And I Pop My Shit)
But I Ain't Gonna Change (I Don't Play That Shit)
G-Unit Do Ya' Thang

[Verse 1 - Young Buck]
Some say I'm crazy for signin with 50 Cent
them same niggaz wouldn't offer to give me shit
niggaz hate you when you rich, but love when you broke
I never knew I had so many enemies before
my arm's is open to anybody who want beef
I promise ya'll I won't sleep, till ya'll layin 6 Ft
G-Unit that's what it is, that's what it's gon' be
Benzino or the Source can't hold me
I been heavensent to put a End to this nonsence
the handle of this 4-5'll make him unconscious
most of these rappers, throw bricks, and hide they head
come to our shows, then hide behind they man, they homie
I understand I'm a target, I'm on top
but understand if you start it, I'm gon' pop
I'm not and artist, buck is a street pharmast
one of the smartest, that gon' get money regardless

[Chorus 2x - Young Buck (D-Tay)]

[Verse 2 - Lloyd Banks]
My eyes low, hydro leakin' out that tahoe
I know G-Unit's them niggaz Im'a ride fo'
nah hoe, I ain't stuntin', nuthing that these niggaz say
fuck the rap, I can get ya' monkey ass good today
ain't nobody picked me up, when I was pinned down
I'm double checkin, for I leave outta my crib now
holdin that 40 on me, sunk in the seat
cuz niggaz feel comfortable when they get in drunk with the heat
I'm ridin' while ya dirty, cuz they gunnin for my top
I ain't duckin and dodgin, I'm only runnin from the cops
spendin grand by the grand by hundred on my watch
just got another buddy, and it holds a 100 shots
I never had a role model, cuz he was in a box
so I'm up in the club with eather, a heater or a house
everyday there's another nigga bleedin on the block
but we ridin' with them burners on, even when it's hot

[Chorus 2x - Young Buck (D-Tay)]
Why?
These Niggaz Want Me Dead (Betta' Watch Yo Step)
Puttin' Prices On My Head (Cuz I Cock My Shit, And I Pop My Shit)
But I Ain't Gonna Change (I Don't Play That Shit)

[Verse 3 - Young Buck]
You see these niggaz get out the pen, and think it's good
go get a pack, and come right back, to the same hood
they think these young niggaz gonna post up, and let 'em get it
ain't been home but 6 months, and got his wig splitted
comitted to the block, guck these niggaz, fuck the cops
fuck these bitches, fuck ya' chain, fuck ya' car, fuck ya' watch
ride and I die for mine, pop's, and I hide the nine
swerving over these white lines, wonderin from the one time
thug and I know I am, bird from a half a gram
broke, so I sold dope, and I'd do it again
don't blame that nigga for runnin up in my house, fool
ain't no food in my daughter mouth, I'm goin out too
just think about what your doin, cuz buddy, bullets burn
may god bless his ass, that was that nigga's turn
I'm not concerned with your death threats
you come down here with that shit, and get left wet
Muthafucka
