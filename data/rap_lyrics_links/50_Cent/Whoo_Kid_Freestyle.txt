(50 cent and G-Unit)
We can't get Money selling weed...WE GON SELL COKE
Ain't no money sellin' coke... WE GON SELL DOPE
Ain't no money sellin' dope... WE GON SELL X
And if niggaz wont by the X... WE GON SELL TECS

(Lloyd Banks)
My advice for y'all niggaz is stop frontin
'Cause 50 say pop somethin', I'm gon pop somethin', what up?

(50 Cent)
Don't make me send a nigga to you, 16 shot ruger
Send twelve shots to you, run four in the clip
Get in the whip, it's a wrap

(Lloyd Banks)
Nah fuck that

(50 Cent)
Man, you done hit the nigga twice in the head, that's that
Niggaz running with the steel out, now it's time to peel out

(Lloyd Banks)
50 let me drive

(50 Cent)
Nah I got this, nigga chill out

(Lloyd Banks)
It'd be nice to get the niggaz ice, get it, give it back

(50 Cent)
Just get in the corner store cause it's full of them A-rabs
They blowin' the shit up like it's okay
I got a bomb on my waist I'm Kamikaze (*laughing*)
I dare Ds to get next to me

(Lloyd Banks)
Or a nigga to creep up and put a tec to me {*explosion*}
Yeah, yeah that's it, it's a freestyle
The fuck you want for free?
Fucking A-rabs just ran the planes into the fucking building
Coke price went up 10 grand this fucking week
