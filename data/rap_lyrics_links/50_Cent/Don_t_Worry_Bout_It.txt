[50 Cent]
Yeah (yeah)

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Don't worry 'bout how I get my money, bitch just know I get my money
Don't worry 'bout how I spend my money, boy I got a lot
Don't worry 'bout that car I drive, don't worry 'bout that bike I ride
Don't worry 'bout them diamonds in that bezel on my watch
Don't worry 'bout it, don't worry 'bout it
Don't worry 'bout a motherfuckin thang
Don't worry 'bout it, don't worry 'bout it
We got a strap up in here if niggaz playin

[50 Cent]
When time pass and I'm not around, niggaz sayin I'm out of town
Probably movin them bricks around, they swear they know how I get down
Don't worry 'bout what I'm doin...
Don't worry 'bout what I'm doin...
My closet full of that fly shit, black card when I buy shit
Sell the shit you get high with, these niggaz on my dick
Don't worry 'bout what I'm doin...
Don't worry 'bout what I'm doin...
That's yo' bitch, I understand, I've seen it all on Instagram
I'm just, from the past, I done been all in that ass
Don't worry 'bout what I'm doin...
Don't worry 'bout what I'm doin...

[Chorus]

[Yo Gotti]
Yeah! Nah
Don't worry 'bout it, don't worry 'bout it

Don't be worried 'bout my record deals cause I still got my plug
Don't be worried 'bout my bitch pimpin, she get money out that club (hah)
Don't be worried 'bout my partners and 'em, we get money, we eatin (I am)
You talk shit 'bout a real nigga, bitch you must be tweakin
Don't be worried 'bout my whereabouts, money all I care about
Keepin it real in my neighborhood, play with me and I'ma air it out
Why you worried 'bout my money nigga? Bitch you think I'm broke? (huh?)
The Feds worry 'bout what I'm doin, think I'm sellin dope
I may be and I may not - go to jail I may rot
I ain't never gon' snitch nigga - never been no bitch nigga
I got big guns, need a extra large, y'all niggaz got question marks
Talkin down on a real nigga, that's how you get a hater charged
Yeah

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Don't worry 'bout what they talkin 'bout, don't tell me what that bitch done said
I'm done with her, you can go with her, I'm leavin here with another bitch
Don't worry 'bout how they look at me, my diamonds on, damn look at me
These pussy niggaz be shook of me, wanna judge and throw the book at me
Don't worry 'bout it, I ain't worried 'bout it, had time to talk to my legal team
Don't worry 'bout it, I ain't worried 'bout it, ain't shit they could do to me
Still rockin, still rollin (rollin)
We holdin (holdin) bill foldin (foldin) you know it
When I start to ball out, money start to fall out
Throw it up, it fall out the sky~!
Baddest bitches go all out, whole bar get bought out
That's what I call my lifestyle~!

[Chorus]
