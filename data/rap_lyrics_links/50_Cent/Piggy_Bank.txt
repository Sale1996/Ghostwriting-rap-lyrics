[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Clickity-clank, clickity-clank
The money goes into my piggy, bank
Clickity-clank, clickity-clank
The money goes into my piggy, bank

[Verse One]
Man I'll get at you - my knife cuts your skin
I'll get at you - blow shots at your man
I'll get at you - dupe I don't pretend
I'll get at you - I'll put that to an end
That damn shit is old, don't be screamin "Get at Me Dog"
Have you runnin for your life when I match ya part
I get to wavin that semi like it's legal
A lil' nigga hurt his arm, lettin off that Eagle, you know me
Black on black Bentley, big ol' black 9
I'll clap your monkey-ass, yeah black on black crime
Big ol' chrome rims gleam, you know how I shine
C'mon on man, you know how I shine
I'm in the hood, in the drop, Teflon vinyl top
Got a 100 guns a 100 clips, why I don't hear no shots?
That fat nigga thought "Lean Back" was "In Da Club"
My shit sold 11 mill', his shit was a dud
Jada' don't fuck with me, if you wanna eat
Cause I'll do yo' little ass like Jay did Mobb Deep
Yeah homey in New York niggaz like your vocals
But that's only New York, dog yo' ass is local

[Chorus]

[Interlude]
Yeah, yeah get more money, more money
Yeah - yeah, yeah get more money, more money
Yeah - yeah, yeah get more money, more money
Yeah - yeah, yeah get more money, more money

[Verse Two]
Banks' shit, sells; Buck's shit, sells
Game's shit, sells; I'm rich as - hell
Shyne poppin off his mouth from a cell
He don't want it with me, he in P.C.
I could have a nigga run up on him with a shank
For just a few pennies out my piggy bank
Yayo bring the condoms, I'm in Room 203
Freak bitch look like Kim before the surgery
Send emergency, for Michael Jackson see
You'll picture and say she looks like me
Kelis said her "Milkshake" bring all the boys to the yard
Then Nas went, and tattooed the bitch on his arm
I mean like way out in Cali niggaz know you cuz
First thing they say about you is youse a sucker for love
This is chess not checkers, these are warning shots
After your next move I'll give you what I got
YEAH

[Chorus]

[Interlude]

[Outro]
When I get at you - I'll punch out your grill
I'll get at you - let off that blue steel
I'll get at you - nigga I'm f'real
I'll get at you - could get yo' ass killed
YEAH!  Yeahhh... hahahaha!
Y'all niggaz gotta do somethin now man
All the shoot 'em up shit y'all be talkin
You gotta do somethin baby!
I mean, I mean c'mon man everybody's listenin
