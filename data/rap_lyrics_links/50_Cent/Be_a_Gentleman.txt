[Chorus]
It's best you be a gentleman
and you watch what you say (bwahh nigga take that)
Or Jesus Christ can't save you once you go gangsta, friend

[50 Cent]
Yo, no more freestyles and verses killin' Sticky and Ja
I've movin' on now, I got bigger fish to fry
Since 'How to Rob' a lot of niggas been naming names
Monkey see monkey do, I done changed the game
Still niggas acting like I don't get down or something
Like I aint the next nigga to wear the crown or something
You gonna talk about your chips till we run in your crib
And you gone ask dumb questions like "Can I Live?"
Look, If I shoot you, I'm famous
If you shoot me your brainless, you said it yourself
I'm slick enough to twist your lines and send them back at you
Swift enough to snatch the mack and pop that at you
Take it personal see if I won't send you to hell
I've done told Ton and Pok? they better have my bail
But if its over a mil don't put the crib up dun
Cause if 50 get free nigga, 50 gonna run

[Chorus]  2x
It's best you be a gentleman
and you watch what you say (bwahh bwahh, nigga take that)
Or Jesus Christ can't save you once you go gangsta, friend
(bo! bo! bo! bo! bo!...It's gangsta)

[50 Cent]
Look I'm supposed to be cocky, I ain't a po' no mo'
I ain't gotta steal from the corna' store no mo'
Got my own crib, I ain't sleepin' on the flo' no mo'
Bouncers don't try to play me at the do' no mo'
But when they see me they say search him
"He might have the nine
He might shoot this motherfucker up like Shyne"
It's been a while since a new nigga came tight like this
Ya man, he aight, but he ain't quite like this
Niggas is feelin' it
The Benz pullin up on the set (uh huh)
Me jumpin out 30 tho on my neck (uh huh uh huh)
And since you said it was nothin' to sweat (what)
That you was outta line so here's what you get
A verbal ass kickin'
Jesus Christ sent me to test ya
Let's see how see how he act's under pressure
Till Makaveli returns it's 'All Eyez On Me'
Till the feds build up cases and find pie's on me

[Chorus]  2x
It's best you be a gentleman
and you watch what you say (bwahh bwahh bwahh, bwahh nigga take that)
Or Jesus Christ can't save you once you go gangsta, friend
(bo! bo! bo!, It's gangsta)

It's gangsta, 2000 shit

(Echoing)
Ya'll know what you need to do, get together,
 make a We Are The World record, faggot ass niggas)
