Yeah..
You Better Kill Me
50, Lemme Get These Niggaz
(Get 'Em Buck!!!)

I brush my teeth, load my clip, and go bust my heat
I'm in too deep, I can't say fuck the streets
I need some sleep, the fiends still comin'
bush 'bout to blow this bitch up
better get money, dead bodys get picked up
I'm david in teen's now
niggaz we're digital, but they work triple beams now
I'm livin' for me now, cuz I done went to war with the other side
lucky me, cuz the enemies mother and brother died
hot shot gun shell's and teflon chest plate's
It's tatt'ed on my arm nigga, thugin' till my death day
y'all niggaz just wait, right after my court date
It's gonna get grimey, like New York say
bitch niggaz horse play, real niggaz gon' spray
bang the fo', change clothes, and come back the same day
better holla mayday, cuz we comin'
and we gunnin at any muthafucka want sumthin

they say thou shall not steal, thou shall not kill
but rub me the wrong way, nigga and I will
thou shall not cheat, thou shall not squeel
cuz niggaz'll put a hole in ya ass, and that's real
they say thou shall not steal, thou shall not kill
but rub me the wrong way, nigga and I will
thou shall not cheat, thou shall not squeel
cuz niggaz'll put a hole in ya ass, and that's real

I'm already dead, can't kill me nigga
and even if I do die, I'm still gon' kill ya
I'm unfamiliar with alot of these soldiers
I go out in the road, and niggaz think that it's over
runnin, the fiends all puttin too much soda on the D'
you would think niggaz know, cuz they older than me
been here longer than me, and still peace'n a ounce out
how can ya' be a birdman, if you don't know how to count
it's back to the black gloves, and home invasions
puttin holes in a nigga, the size of a gold dayton
no I'm not waitin on nothin, no more
eather you pay me what you wwe me, or I'm cuttin ya throat
nigga ya baby momma know me, go and ask the hoe
how I done tied her ass up over a bag of dope
I'll be glad to go to the pen over revenge
I'm comin' out the same way, a nigga went in

they say thou shall not steal, thou shall not kill
but rub me the wrong way, nigga and I will
thou shall not cheat, thou shall not squeel
cuz niggaz'll put a hole in ya ass, and that's real
they say thou shall not steal, thou shall not kill
but rub me the wrong way, nigga and I will
thou shall not cheat, thou shall not squeel
cuz niggaz'll put a hole in ya ass, and that's real

Boom!, G-Unit!!!, We on some military  shit nigga
you better kill us all, cuz we commin'
Muthafucka's!
