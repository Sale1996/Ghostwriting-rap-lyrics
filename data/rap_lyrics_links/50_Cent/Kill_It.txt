[Lloyd Banks]
Girl, you're something special
I just want the chance to get to know you better
Wine you and caress you
Spoil and impress you
Put you in my front seat, take you home and sex you

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
I used to day dream about the green, now I got it
Fast cars, credit card, Louie wallet
The girl I'm with now is hot, but you hotter
One look at you and I almost forgot her
She goin' wanna kill me, cause I wanna kill it
shawty, let me get it, I'mma spend a weekend in it
Get one impression, swear I gotta kill it
Hour after hour, girl, you goin' need a minute

[Lloyd Banks]
I'm into steady stuntin' in my Phantom ghost
Brand new Louie, brand new outfit and my brand new toast
Rep by the love, get my cake and eat it, I want both 
I'm only here for the summer then I'm leaving out the coast
If we get close, I'mma have to book another seat
Baby, something sweet, body you would love to keep
Been fucked to sleep
We can stay up, drink all this Rose up
Smoke my weed and kick it, that sex gobbled a day up
For me this girl's a lay up, she knows I don't need it
Difference is I want someone I could see me with
Could be our little secret
Not cause I'm ashamed, but for all the nosy hoes
infatuated with fame
Pussy's my addiction, yours is like cocaine
Girl, let me light your life up
Put you on the game
I have you riding Bentley, put you off the train
Strike a pose, take aim, not to put you out the frame

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
I used to day dream about the green, now I got it
Fast cars, credit card, Louie wallet
The girl I'm with now is hot, but you hotter
One look at you and I almost forgot her
She goin' wanna kill me, cause I wanna kill it
shawty, let me get it, I'mma spend a weekend in it
Get one impression, swear I gotta kill it
Hour after hour, girl, you goin' need a minute

[Lloyd Banks]
Ugh, I had a shorty, but after fucking you, it's over
I'm all wet, momma sitting on a super soaker
Ruin the sofa, I bend her over, bruise her chocha
Hell of a looker, somebody should give you a poster
She's my holster, careful how you fools approach her
see we're tight now and everyday we're moving closer
When I'm with you is when I'm calm, baby, you the bomb
Fat ass, fly shit on, Christian Louboutin
Cruise along beaches, Canary Island features
Lambourghini, Porches, gorgeous chrome sneakers
The gossip won't reach us
We in another World, keep doing that, I won't think 'bout another girl
Bad bitches fuck, come now is all I've done
One million reasons why I ain't belong with them
We live with no worries and spend money for fun
Dodge, no flurries, lear jetting to the sun

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
I used to day dream about the green, now I got it
Fast cars, credit card, Louie wallet
The girl I'm with now is hot, but you hotter
One look at you and I almost forgot her
She goin wanna kill me, cause I wanna kill it
shawty, let me get it, I'mma spend a weekend in it
Get one impression, swear I gotta kill it
Hour after hour girl, you goin' need a minute

[Governor]
You got it, baby
Almost forget her...
