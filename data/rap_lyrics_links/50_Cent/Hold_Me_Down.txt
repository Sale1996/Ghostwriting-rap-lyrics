[Chorus]
I promise to keep you close to me
You give me a sense of security
Through drama, you will be all I need
Straight up now, I need you to hold me down, hold me down
I need you to hold me down, hold me down
I need you to hold me
Down

[Verse 1]
Through every altercation
I put no one above you, MM-MM I love you
They shook up when we jooks 'em
You see how they be lookin'
It's frightening like lightning
You crack off, they start bookin'
It's beef until I get out
In broad day with my shit out
That's when they say I'm illin'
And when she get to killin'
Now my baby she precious
I warn you not to test this
I aim her at your head nigga
Motherfuck the vestes
I'm antisocial, quit acting like you know me
Before I go postal, you know I gotta owe me
I'm ridin' with her ol' cocked
Audi R8 drop
Feel the wind blow
Twist the indo
Smoke it up, it's fundamental
You can't get to her, poke 'em up
When we get intimate
That's when I get into shit
She 32 I'm 34, I fuck her raw
She revolve 6 times then I feed her more

[Chorus]
I promise to keep you close to me
You give me a sense of security
Through drama, you will be all I need
Straight up now, I need you to hold me down, hold me down
I need you to hold me down, hold me down
I need you to hold me
Down

[Verse 2]
When niggas get to trippin'
I need you by my side, yeah, so they can't catch me slippin'
I take you out shoppin',
Get you clean, get it poppin'
Use my finger, get ya hot girl
I know your spot, yeah
I love you if you love me back
You never jam when I react
To sucka shit
When they get hit
And we take off
If you get tossed
I'll be back
I want you so I'll be back
I'll never change
I be the same
A nigga stunt I let it rain
I'm off the chain
I'm all in mayne
I'll hit you up you think I'm playin'
I be strapped
Go 'head fuck around, I be strapped
24/7
I'm back holdin', mistake me for a chump
Bite off more than you can chew, more beef than you want
Come through repeatedly, show you what bananas about
I'm a mechanic, find out when the hammers come out

[Chorus]
I promise to keep you close to me
You give me a sense of security
Through drama, you will be all I need
Straight up now, I need you to hold me down, hold me down
I need you to hold me down, hold me down
I need you to hold me
Down
