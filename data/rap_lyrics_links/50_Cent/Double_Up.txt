[50 Cent]
Yeah
It is what it is son, niggaz can't stand it
It's my fifth lap, a nigga been 'round and 'round the planet
Shawty sayin "Welcome to Miami"
Her friends sayin "Welcome to Miami"
Jet skis, the yacht, parked in the back yard
Back to back Porsches, a nigga go that hard
I love money, nigga this drug money
Laundromat spin cycle, make it snow money
Beef nothin to a nigga, nigga I'm comfy
Throw a hundred racks on a bitch, I told ya she want me
If I want the hoe I get the hoe, fuck the hoe then forget the hoe
Let a hoe be a hoe, pay a pimp, pay the rent
I'm a fly nigga on or off, yeah I buy fly shit
Presidential Roley, nigga tell me, now can you buy that?
I'm the biggest nigga Southside seen since Fat Cat
I tell a nigga suck a dick quick cause I'm strapped jack

I make it double up, pure blocks of raw
I, I, I did it, I got to get more
I make it double up, baking soda galore
'Til we in Bentleys and mansions with marble on the floor
I make it double up
Ay bring me that Pyrex
Get the baking soda, the ice
I'ma show you how to do this shit
You think I don't know what I'm doin but I know what I'm doin

[Hayes]
We on the other side of the border chillin with drug lords
Tryin to put a order in during the drug wars
Jay said this what happen when you disrespect one of us
And cut a motherfucker head off right in front of us
That's when I said I'm goin back to Cali
My man said he goin back to Cali
I know some Mexicans in Arizona I'm cool with
I'd rather slang that than come and deal with this bullshit
... Cause I ain't gon' budge
Pay me or die G, dawg it ain't no love
Niggaz know who they owe, my number ain't change bitch
Front door service, put one in your brain quick
Could've put it right in your chest, close range shit
Watch you die slow, let you know who you playin with
Fuck all that swearin to God, promise and prayin shit
I ain't a big sob story fan, I'm sprayin shit
12-gauge, AR-15, AK'n shit
Passanger seats gon' get killed, I'm sayin this
Princi-pals, we don't draw the line at drug dealin
We crimi-nals goin all out
Before I say you played me I'll go in y'all house
And get killed there or blow your fuckin brains out
You gotta bring ya ass to get some
You gotta make cash to spend some
And I ain't a victim muh'fucker - Hayes
