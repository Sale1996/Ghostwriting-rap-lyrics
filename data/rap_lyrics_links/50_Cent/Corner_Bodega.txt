[50 Cent]
Aight, check this shit out
Y'all niggaz gon' stay in the car
I'm'a go right over here and see somethin
Gimme ten minutes, If I don't come out, y'all come in
The money stays in the car 'til I say so...
Aiyyo, whattup whattup, man
This is what y'all niggaz is workin' wit' for 22 cents a gram? 

Man, when I come up in here treat me like I'm fam
I could go Uptown and get this shit for 16 cents a gram
Bottom line is, man, I gotta cop and go
I got a spot and I can't afford to stop the flow
Poppi, what the fuck is the matter wit' ya Man?
Standin' against the wall with a gun in his hand
I ain't on no funny shit I'm on some get this money shit
Every four days in PA I move another brick
According to the DA I sold dope in VA
my crew stay in Queens but my plates say VA
I'll show you where I rest at, it aint hard to find me
Let me buy a brick and get the other on cossimy
(Hey, this life is hard man) I know, don't remind me
If I catch another case I'ma kill Guiliani 
It ain't even safe to sell a pack at night
Got task ridin 'round the projects on Mountain Bikes

[Chorus - repeat 2X]
NY ain't the same, it's OT playa
you can go and cop coke from the corner Bodega
hit the highway and take it to a town near you
And get that money man, get that money man

[50 - singing]
Now, if you come to 1-3-4 and I'm not around
That means I copped and I went outta town
You motherfuckers know how I get down
About my money man, about my money man
