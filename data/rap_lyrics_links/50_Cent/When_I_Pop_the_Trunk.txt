[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Nigga no wake, no pine box, no funeral, just nine shots
Take 'Pac five, plus BIG four, you got 50, I love war
Who waan box? with my ox, who waan dump? I waan dump
It's click clack pop pop when I pop the trunk
It's click clack pop pop when I pop the trunk

[Verse One: 50 Cent]
I think I got 'em, ten shots follow the trail of the blood drops
Fuck the police, better talk to Allah ack
Nigga you bleedin bad, yeah, you bleedin bad
Your rolex soaked, like a cortex with no neck
It's gonna get dark, where's the cops when you fuckin need 'em
That blood fill in your lungs boy I see you weezin
The harder you tryin to run the more you leakin
You could have found somethin better to do this weekend
I got a arsenal pointin tips in my arch for you
Battery acid I burn your face off properly
Guns ammo, knife Rambo nightmare
Wake up I'm right there ya hell nound, hell yeah

[Chorus: Kidd Kidd]
Who waan box? with my ox, who waan dump? I waan dump
It's click clack pop pop when I pop the trunk
It's click clack pop pop when I pop the trunk
Who waan box? with my ox, who waan dump? I waan dump
It's click clack pop pop when I pop the trunk
It's click clack pop pop when I pop the trunk

[Verse Two: Kidd Kidd]
HUH!!! Talk that shit now I love it when you front
Eatin all that pussy guess cat got your tongue 
Open up your mouth and say it to the pump
Buckshot come out the back of your neck like razor bumps
I'm too small to fight you could swing all you want
I box with the ox you drop I swing once
(HUH!!!) This a sad scene, at least you die happy
Next lit, ear to ear look like you was smilin at me
Damn Kidd Kidd snuffed me after he just dapped me
That lil' nigga grimey, bitch I'm from Mays End Street
If you hollerin gangsta shit, come get at me
I sprint like athletes in a track meet

[Chorus: Kidd Kidd]
Who waan box? with my ox, who waan dump? I waan dump
It's click clack pop pop when I pop the trunk
It's click clack pop pop when I pop the trunk
Who waan box? with my ox, who waan dump? I waan dump
It's click clack pop pop when I pop the trunk
It's click clack pop pop when I pop the trunk
