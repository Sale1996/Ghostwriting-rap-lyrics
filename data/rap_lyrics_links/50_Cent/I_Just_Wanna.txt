[Intro: 50 Cent]
YEAH! UH HUH! YEAH!
THIS MONEY IS MINE!

[Verse One: 50 Cent]
Look nigga if you don't love yourself ain't nobody 'gon love you
Your shit ain't right what bitch in her right mind 'gon fuck you (YEAH!)
That's what they told me then, so I was like fuck a bitch!
I'm a grind on my shine in time I'm a blow they mind (UH HUH!)
Oh now she like me oh oh oh now they like me
All I want is a blow job this bitch wanna be wifey
No pre course meal all I want is fast food
I wanna have fun how about a quickie huh!?

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I don't wanna love....you
I just wanna unbutton your blouse and let the girls out
I wanna fuck....you
Maybe later on if your free you can come to my house
Only if you want...to
We can get freakier and freakier than you ever been
You want....to?
We can get freakier and freakier you can bring a friend

[Verse Two: Tony Yayo]
Yeah! Bitches from Belize, tree fall in the weed
Remy crew got me sweatin out her Remy weave
Fuck a model tonight my bitches from the P's
The Baisley's she's the projects dick tease
Them hood bitches always bring back memories
They all catch them vapors like Yayo you remember me?
I certainly do, pull that curtain on that 6'2
Head for free, she on that menstrual
I promise I don't love 'em I don't cuff 'em
I don't pay a bitch rent to have the next nigga fuckin
I'm a pimp with principles, kill 'em with visuals
My diamonds like Dubai sauce bitch!

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I don't wanna love....you
I just wanna unbutton your blouse and let the girls out
I wanna fuck....you
Maybe later on if your free you can come to my house
Only if you want...to
We can get freakier and freakier than you ever been
You want....to?
We can get freakier and freakier you can bring a friend

[Verse Three: 50 Cent]
I don't want a relationship I just want to have fun
In every position we can't come up until were done
At my request is to kick that shit in my ear
Like to hear what your thinkin after laughin and drinkin
Though we can have a ball, yeah we can do it all
Moon shine, light up the sky at nighttime 
With me, any time could be the right time
I'm sort of impulsive, I'm kind of explosive
Me, just take a little at a time in doses
Don't want you addicted, I just wanna kick it
You could pick the spot I'll be there with the greatness
Give it to you good when I'm gone I'm sure you 'gon miss this

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I don't wanna love....you
I just wanna unbutton your blouse and let the girls out
I wanna fuck....you
Maybe later on if your free you can come to my house
Only if you want...to
We can get freakier and freakier than you ever been
You want....to?
We can get freakier and freakier you can bring a friend

[Outro: 50 Cent]
YEAH! THIS MONEY IS MINE! HA HA! G-G-G-G-G-G-UNIT!!!
