[Intro]
*Sniff Sniff* You smell that? What's that?
I smell pussy! (Is that you Irv?)
I smell pussy! (Is that you Ja?)
I smell pussy! (Is that you Black?)
I smell pussy! (Is that you Tah?)

[Verse One]
Y'all niggas is pussy!!!!!
I'm falling out nigga now watch me (watch me)
Ain't nothing you can do to stop me (stop me)
Y'all niggas get so emotional (emotional) 
You remind me of my bitch...HaHa

It's not of my nature to make a commitment so let me breathe
What she doesn't understand catch attitudes when I leave her
Quite of probation just make it harder for me to accept her as my own
She tries to tie up my phone and
I'm not at home she's thinking I'm not alone
Probably out tryin' to bone anything in the street
I let her know she can leave I ain't tryin' to tie her up
But see it's hard to fuck wit somebody after she touches me
Mami I'm not your regular nigga I know the game
But I don't play by the rules I'm focusing on my moves
That way I will never lose
See I can tell by your shoes if you attracted to Bentleys with 22's
You say I confuse you play little trick with your head
Been catching feelings ever since the first time I slept in your bed
I'm not here to tease you mislead you with so your dreams
I can't say I love you I don't know what that means
I'M A PIMP!!!!

[Chorus (twice)]
Girl you know I like when you climb on top
Love muscle feel tighter than a headlock
And you know I love the way you make the bed rock
Take me to Ecstasy with out takin Ecstasy
Girl you know I like when you climb on top
Love muscle feel tighter than a headlock
And you know I love the way you make the bed rock
Take me to Ecstasy with out takin Ecstasy


[Verse Two]
When I first met her, I did anything to get her
Paid all her bills and filled her frigerator
Reminiscing on late nights when I tried to lay up
But couldn't get off 'cause your baby would stay up
She even crashed the whip tryin' to switch in the third lane
That's when I realized this bitch was a bird brain
A pigeon writing her baby pops in the box in prison
Sing-Sing is where he been in
She in the Gucci tights and Fendi high heels
Baby wipes and cans of Enfamil
Motor Bikes and grams of fish scale
So 9 to 5 niggas was no frill
Turning young niggas with principals to old men with debts
And all the prank calls was death threats
That bitch got the best sex all across the globe
And the bitch head game was out of control

[Chorus (twice)]

[Verse Three]
I wonder when I'm gone if you miss me
Or do you miss that Don Perignon and that Christy
I'm fuckin wit you
I'm feeling your shape I'm feeling your eyes
later on I'm feeling your ass and feeling your thighs
Sweetheart you book smart and street-smart
I knew you was my type from the very, very start
I'm in to tongue kissing  4 play all day
Mamma ain't home so  the noise is okay
ODB you know he like it the raw way
Latex, safe sex ,no hickeys on the neck
Now your learning
The lords blesses make me wiser as the worlds turning
My tongue touch the right spot I'll have your toes curling
Whether we just kicking it or we sexing
I'm a pro baby girl I spit game to perfection
So when niggas make mistakes I correct 'em and
When niggas get out of line I check the man

[Chorus]

(50 Cent talking)
Yeah........ don't think I forgot about your fat ass though Irv
You wanna run around takin pictures like you Puff Daddy and the Family motherfucker
With that bitch Charli Baltimore...
Bitch look like she died last week pale as fuck
Paint her hair red...
Think she gon' sell records tryin' to impersonate Pink and shit!
Bitch... punk-ass motherfuckers
All you motherfuckers get rolled on nigga
Ain't no motherfucking, "leave her alone 'cause she a bitch"
FUCK that nigga!!  Fuck all of it!!
But not you Ashanti baby
You know how I feel about you baby
Come on... come here girl... c'mon gimme some love girl
Fuck Irv Gotti... you know how me and you do baby
You know... they say I'm sexy now... HaHaHa
Aye Irv your momma got a thing for me!!!!
