[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Me, I'm like a pilot, G5 jet I'm fly as shit
You cannot deny it, oh no, no no no no
Bitches be on my dick, designer threads I'm fly as shit
You cannot deny it, oh no, no no no no
Better back up off me bitch, watch me ball (ball, ball)
Better back up off me bitch, watch me ball (ball, ball)
Better back up off me bitch, watch me ball (ball, ball)
Better back up off me bitch, watch me ball (ball, ball)

[50 Cent]
Nigga e'ry law and e'ry rule I break, Feds tryna watch moves I make
E'ry day I get birthday cake, there's a hundred racks there in that safe
Hundred grams there on that plate, I ain't thinkin 'bout catchin no case
Nigga my safe house super safe, I zip Giuseppe's, I don't tie no lace
Tom Ford, Y-S-L, nigga run tell, I'm fly as hell
Big Bentley, Mulsanne, no LP, just two songs
A-side, B-side, Rider Gang, bitch that's right
From N.O. to N.Y., I got shooters bitch; don't act cute and shit
We was born broke, no silver spoon, my niggaz strapped, they super goons
These niggaz here kinda soft, we get the bread then fuck it off
Get mo' money then fuck it off, make yo' bitch wan' suck me off
We ain't had shit, we learned to ball, them ghetto bitches they love us all

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
Shorty bounce it and she clap that, slide down the pole, she a super hoe
That gold Cuban I jack that, you niggaz know how this s'posed to go
I'm in the club with niggaz, I clap that, that P-90, I pack that
Yo' fuckin head, I'll crack that, you wan' test me? Don't test me
Look lover boy, what you trippin fo'? Niggaz don't even want yo' hoe
My nigga Ill fresh out the pen, you gon' make him go back again
Them bottles comin, we turnt up, them sparks burnin, now watch us shine
You do this shit once a year, we do this shit all the time
Now captain come and save her, get her from 'round this paper
She'll never be the same, I mean like e'rything will change
She cute, blow a lil' cheese on her, get her ass shots, throw D's on her
Them shoes more than you think though, my bitch look like my bank roll

[Chorus]
