[Intro]
I NEED MORE BOTTLES!!!

[Chorus]
I'm a need a double, bring it on a double (YEAH!)
A bottle each hand, I'm the fuckin man  (YEAH!)
Cars, double, broads, double
And I don't have a girl, so I can't get in trouble
And I can do what I can do whatever I want
Drink 'til I'm drunk and smoke my blunt
My baby outside you should hear my trunk (UH HUH!)
They 'gon think about this stunt all month (YEAH!)

[Verse One]
Don't nobody see y'all 'cause we are the best (UH!)
The mighty mighty Unit blue fitted blue vest
Watch me get 'em who's next? Who wanna be the one
I'm shinnin royal diamonds in the night club with my gun (YEAH!!!!)
Back to the money twenty four hours committed
And I'm strapped, like the mummy you a dummy you could get it
You ain't gettin nothin from me better get it how you live it (YEAH!!!!)
All my days are sunny, I stay wherever you visit
Rich nigga I ain't got to think all day
Cash made Rozay and my mink long hey
I own V.I.P. have a drink on me
Girl we run this city that's how shit 'gon be (HEY)

[Chorus]
I'm a need a double, bring it on a double (YEAH!)
A bottle each hand, I'm the fuckin man  (YEAH!)
Cars, double, broads, double
And I don't have a girl, so I can't get in trouble
And I can do what I can do whatever I want
Drink 'til I'm drunk and smoke my blunt
My baby outside you should hear my trunk (UH HUH!)
They 'gon think about this stunt all month (YEAH!)

[Verse Two]
Yeah! Uh! Shorty say I talk alot of shit
I told her fuck talkin I can back it up quick (YEAH!)
She seen as I'm sittin this two hundred thousand whip
And I ain't never seen a vagina I couldn't hit
I, roll up like a Marley in my brand new Klum Kardi's
Lamborghini, Ferrari when I pull up at the party
She's usually snotty now she's showin off her body
Frontin and while she's walkin and claim that's she's ridin shotty
Moet, Henny, Bacardi have ya chasin everybody (YEAH!)
Outside Bentley hittin so four wheel at the cotty (YEAH!)
G's! Check! Bentley! Jet!
Sour on deck! Frizzy! Neck baby!!!

[Chorus]
I'm a need a double, bring it on a double (YEAH!)
A bottle each hand, I'm the fuckin man  (YEAH!)
Cars, double, broads, double
And I don't have a girl, so I can't get in trouble
And I can do what I can do whatever I want
Drink 'til I'm drunk and smoke my blunt
My baby outside you should hear my trunk (UH HUH!)
They 'gon think about this stunt all month (YEAH!)

[Outro]
I can do what I can do whatever I want
I can do what I can do whatever I want
I'm a need a double, bring it on a double
I'm a need a double, bring it on a double
The cars, double, broads, double
