[Lloyd Banks]
The hood lane kinda naked so I'ma take it
Been here before, my rhymin ancient and I'm endangered
When e'rything awkward, I gotta change it
Bringin the swag, whip game like a dominatrix
Hot-headed with no kind of patience
While I recline they tastin, more than half of my life vagina chasin
I dream of purple by the dump truck
I'm poppin all across the boards, surf's up, label black and purp'ed up
Hustle like a traffic bum, the golden voice rapper son
Louie to the shoe, we bling Dapper Dan for half of them
I'm double action averagin, fuck love and marriage and I'm happy
Rollin stone, spittin image of pappy
Get at me, spar with a G, ten in my khaki
Chronic cheese chasin, troopers tryin to trap me
Rewards to snatch me, no love for the law, my lawyer back me
Money's the root of evil and my root exactly, tax me

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
Eyes wide, that's how it happens on the corner (on the corner)
Uh, eyes wide, that's how it happens on the crooked cold corner (cold corner)
The protection is gettin stronger
Walk around with your head in the ground, you'll be a goner (be a goner)
Eyes wide, that's how it happens on the corner (on the corner)
Uh, eyes wide, that's how it happens on the crooked cold corner... {*echoes*}

[Lloyd Banks]
Uh, I'm sharper than the, wood on a splinter; sit back and let the king record
You know me, I O.D., Shinobi when I swing my sword
Mindstate by the grip, my way out the whip
Been chasin 'fetti all week, Sundays I pop my shit
Born to ball, world in my palm, Stockton grip
Stumble cross the outfit I'ma get my beef and broccolis with
R.I.P. to Huey O. and Kev
I know they lookin down on me therefore I make a movie on the reg'
Stupid sweet jacuzzi on the ledge
I hit the strip these groupies want my leg
Drag 'em like a chain and ball
Fuss cause I'm famous, funny I ain't want the fame at all
Fuck y'all gon' sleep on a bank, I remain appalled
When I have a baby that baby's spoiled
Built for the storm like a Navy SEAL, 2-11 Mercedes wheel
Chill, legend with or without a record deal
Southside on the fuckin map, lil' niggaz tuckin steel, still

[Chorus]
