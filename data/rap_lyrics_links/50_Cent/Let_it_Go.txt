(LET, IT, GO!)

[Mavado]
I'm a gannnnngsta
I'm a gangsta for life
I'm a gannnnngsta
Reeeeeal gangsta (LET, GO!)
I'm a gannnnngsta
I'm a gangsta for life
I'm a gannnnngsta
Reeeeeal gangsta (LET, IT, GO!)

[Lloyd Banks]
Yeah, yeah, uhh, G-G-G-G you know!
Uhh.. the game took a turn crazy, it's all gravy
Thanks to 50 Cent and Shady, they gon' play me
These lil' niggaz can't fade me, they just babies
Play me I'm arm crazy, I'm Tom Brady 
Emeralds and baguettes when I'm hoppin up off the jet
A nigga reach for that and I'm choppin him in his neck
One big remix, and she'll be on my penis
If my flow had a phoenix and my paws are the cleanest
9-millimeters in the bars and arenas
If you hood then you seen us, with wood in the Beamers
I'm that new nigga, they all over Adidas
When they see us they don't charge that shit, they wanna be us
(LET, IT, GO!)

[Interlude: Mavado]
When we pressed to go, body restin up
They wan' mop up all that blood, but he's testin us
The moon eclipse, is a mess and ah
We'll compose {?} they testin oh (LET, GO!)

[Chorus: Mavado]
I'm a gannnnngsta
I'm a gangsta for life
I'm a gannnnngsta
Don't fuck around and start some fight

[Tony Yayo]
Yeah, yeah! (LET, IT, GO!)
I'm Marvin Bernard, hip-hop goin hard
Feds ran in the crib, squad all in my yard
I'm the high school dropout, crack game genius
The mac'll turn your back into "Kill Bill" arenas
I'm - criminal minded - you've been blinded
Feds lookin for my bricks but can't find it
Maneuver with the Ruger, the grip is rubber
My Frank Mueller, is dipped in them rainbow colors
Bein broke is a disease, I need that guap and that cheddar
I learned that, in the Maybach, with Fif' and Mayweather
Mix the milk with Amaretta, my beretta's in my leather
My tiger striped eagle make your people need weather (LET, IT, GO!)

[Interlude] Â– 2X

[Chorus]

[Mavado]
I want to dance
IIIII'm, reachin up and, huh
