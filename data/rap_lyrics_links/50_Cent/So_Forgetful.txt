[Intro: Lloyd Banks]
Haha! Yeah! Damn! How long has it been?
How you been though? Nah stop, you know I miss you girl!
Ha let's go upstairs though

[Verse One: Lloyd Banks]
Uh! Boy Wonder, one summer I was stuntin
Winter folds when I cake more, bag models and crush 'em
I ain't never been a cuffer and my lifestyle is customed
Chromy Cartier karat glare keep me hustlin
My Lamborghini sunked in, dime humpin 
Them tight bikinis come when you're out here doin somethin
I know it's somethin for me deep, is it you?
Problem is I'm thinkin her too and your crew
Her girl Sue got a body like a spur new
And I won't cruise, take years to make ya sole move
I'm so cool ice grills from my cold jewels
Make my own rules, baby I'm a freedom lampin old schools
She asked why should she? You think you special?
Hell fuckin yeah now come here let me bless you
Hit yeah no air hit you in the pretzel
And I don't remember how I met you, so forgetful

[Chorus: Ryan Leslie]
I deal with a lot of pretty girls, so forgive me if I don't remember you
(Yeah, so forgive me girl I'm so forgetful)
And it's too many New York City girls, so forgive me if I don't remember you
(If I don't remember you, noooooooo!!!)

[Verse Two: Lloyd Banks]
Wet spots on the mattress and champagne splashes
Designer glasses, a couple backstage passes
And they fine asses, damn, how did y'all get here?
How are ya gettin home? Cause a nigga gone
Get dressed quick, grab her ass, grab my phone
Walkin out alone smellin like chronic bag cologne
Drivin home still drunk, hope they don't pull me
Cause I'm ridin with the bully and it's loaded fully
Feel me? Game tight girl, I ain't a rookie
Hear me? I love the chips, treat 'em like my family
And we, got a thing for the light
Ball out, fall out, do the same thing tonight
Flashbacks of ass claps it's goin down
Long as she black jack, weed up let's hope we don't snap back (yeah)
The last text I got says "I missed you"
I must've missed somethin, so forgetful

[Chorus: Ryan Leslie]
I deal with a lot of pretty girls, so forgive me if I don't remember you
(Somethin 'bout you makes me want to, remember you, remember you)
And it's too many New York City girls, so forgive me if I don't remember you
(Forgive me if I don't, remember you)

[Bridge: Ryan Leslie]
Flights and planes, overseas
Don't be mad, you know my steez
All at once, I'll be gone
If you miss me, play this song
I'll do me, you do you
It was good girl, but we're through
For now, yeah, so I bet ya
Girl I bet ya, I'll forget ya

[Chorus: Ryan Leslie]
I deal with a lot of pretty girls, so forgive me if I don't remember you
(Girl forgive me, if I don't, remember yooooooouuuuuuu!!!)
And it's too many New York City girls, so forgive me if I don't remember you
(So forgive me if I don't remember, yooouuuuuuuuu!!!)
I deal with a lot of pretty girls, so forgive me if I don't remember you
(So many faces, so many places, said it's hard to track them all)
And it's too many New York City girls, so forgive me if I don't remember you
(If I don't remember you, oh ohhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!)

[Outro: Ryan Leslie]
R. Les!!! Just rock with it!!! Blue Hef!!!! Yeah!!!
If I don't remember you, said I swear it's nothin new
