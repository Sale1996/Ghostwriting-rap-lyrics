Money make a pimp, pimp hoes, hustlas sell dope, thugs gun smoke
What(echo)
Money make the world go round, as the world turns
Money make the world go round, as the world turns
Nigga I need money to main-tainn
Hustalin aint a gamee
Nigga go and gets the grainn
Gon' get tore out the framee

I'm in ta nice thanggs I slang weed (snort)
Coc-ainee and Herio-anee
50 Cent
Thats my namee
Nigga I bring the painn
You thought shit stay the samee
Nigga shit gon' change
Put a bullet in your brainn
Nigga at close range
Run away wit ya rollie, your rings, and your motherfuckin chainn
Aint nuittin funny mangg
I'm about my money mangg
Bitch get down on that track and get my money, I aint playinn
Better understan what I'm sayin,
What I'm sayin, I aint playin
I'll be, In front of your crib, layin, wit the mack ta start sprayinn
Any nigga thats in the game, for the fame, gotta be a lamee
Crackers'll put ya in chains
Box'll drive you insane
Sun cant shine all the time, man its gotta rain
That whole loose? is ill
You better crack the whip mang

(Chorus - 50 Cent)
A pimp aint a pimp with no hoes (hoes)
A hustla aint a hustla with no motherfuckin dough (dough)
A thug aint a thug if his gun dont smoke (smoke)
A playa aint a playa if his ass dead broke (broke)

A pimp aint a pimp with no motherfuckin hoes (hoes)
A hustla aint a hustla with no motherfuckin dough (dough)
A thug aint a thug if his gun dont smoke (smoke)
A playa aint a playa if his ass dead broke (broke)

(50 Cent)
I live
Life in the fast lane
Man I aint got nuttin ta lose 
Everythin a game
Either you wit me or against me man aint nuttin changee
Nigga, you
Go against the grain 
I'll make you
Walk wit a cane now nigga now
Who you gon' blamee
When shit aint the same
Nigga nobody hears your namee
You got down wit a gangg
O thirty-one blood
Ya'll niggas do your thang 
You got 2 felonies 
Fuck it, go out wit a bangg
Ya'll niggas wanna hangg
Wit niggas that fitlthy rich
They aint even got ta talk
To take your bitch
One look was all it took
She seen the benz-o
She seen them T.Vs
And them big ol' chriz-omes
A-yo the bitch useta bring you dough
Useta be your bottom hoe
Now your paper comin' slow
She feel like she had ta go
Roll wit them rich niggas and ball with them ball-az
Politic wit the willies the real shot call-az

(Bun B)
I got one life to live
Follow that light that keeps on guidin me
Hate-az tryin me
Hoes is a-bidein me
Media ride me
King a the underground 
So the streets is steady hide-in me
Representin sure taste-az
The yay keep takin pride in me
Streets 
Deciple slide-in me 
Status reports the badest you caught
Walk in the black top wit fat rocks and had his newport
I cant stay away like Too $hort
I gots ta break a bastards back
Tore em up, get em ready ta port
Put em on the master track
I blast the facts the life in the grill
Gorilla pimpin
If I have ta mack ya wife then I will
It's me and 50 Cent my nigga
Live in trife, and thats real
Talkin shit on us, thats like pullin out a knife and dont kill
Thats on for treal (?)
I'm on for million wit your pit, in the clit that shit true
I split through, your defences, so relentless, get you, without you even 
knoin
Got you strippin and even hoe-in
You dont wanna let the pro in the door
This what we showin


A pimp aint a pimp with no motherfuckin hoes (hoes)
A hustla aint a hustla with no motherfuckin dough (dough)
A thug aint a thug if his gun dont smoke (smoke)
A playa aint a playa if his ass dead broke (broke)

(Repeat)

(50 Cent)
Is your bitch your bitch or is your bitch mines?
Is your bitch your bitch all the time?
You done got your paper, now its time I get mines
Except the serve and everything'll be fine
Bitch!

(50 Cent talking over beat)
Runnin from pimpin...bitch you need to run TO some pimpin
Wit them cheap ass payless shoes you got on hoe
You still aint figured out what a hoe supposed to look like
Look at you motherfucka here
Huh bitch?
How you gunna catch some dates lookin like that hoe?
Bitch get off the sidewalk and into the street
Bitch the sidewalk is for pimpin bitch!
