{"Bang bang, I shot you down bang bang"}
{"You hit the ground, bang bang"}
{"That awful sound - bang bang"}
{"I used to shoot you down"}

[Young Buck]
Don't nobody wanna die, but e'rybody wanna ball
Somebody gotta go when them killers call (dang)
You know it's in us all, you just gotta find it and use it
You can get away with it, if you don't abuse it - the streets talk
Now be smart cause that heat comin
And if they know that you did it you betta keep runnin (run nigga!)
I think I see sum'n, there go my enemy
Only Lord knows what this nigga fin' to be
Ten a ki' still the price, this is real - if you're lucky
might give it to you for five, depend on if I took it
Nigga anything go, my shop never close
From the nickels and the dime to the whole KILO
The real niggaz feel me, the haters wanna kill me
But I'm holdin down my city, me and this nine milli'
Why you throwin bricks and hidin your head, homey I know where you hang
Ain't no thang for me to walk up, and let that chopper go

[Chorus]
{"Bang bang, I shot you down"}
{"Bang bang, you hit the ground"} Now all the gangstas pray
Lord forgive me but he tried to kill me {"Bang bang"}
Somebody out there gotta feel me {"I shot you down"}
Lord forgive me but he tried to kill me {"Bang bang"}
Somebody out there gotta feel me {"That awful sound"}

[Young Buck]
Just think if I ain't empty the clip and he killed me
Would I still be livin, would my homeboys miss me?
How many niggaz bust they gun when they have to
Don't need no ski-mask when it's time to get at you
I'm glad you didn't see what it looked like when we left
Brain fragments for shotgun blastin, 'll take a nigga breath
It's death before dishonesty, dope deals and robbery
Poppa wasn't around but that shit didn't bother me
I'll probably be in the penitentiary
But I'll play the cards that the dear Lord sent to me, the whole truth
I use this booth to speak to my thug niggaz
Why you mad at me?  The government's the drug dealers (fo' sho')
Before I let these po-lice keep harassin me
This rookie-ass cop gon' have to blast me
He asked me for identification, I looked at him and laughed
He made a move and I heard a blast, that's what you get bitch (boom!)

[Chorus]

[Young Buck]
It's goin down around here nigga
Get your muh'fuckin head bust
The muh'fuckin street lights go out
and them real niggaz come out
All the bitch niggaz go in the house
Shit is not a game man
Don't fuck around and lose your brain
And ay, all my real niggaz pray

[Outro]
Lord forgive me but he tried to kill me {"Bang bang"}
Somebody out there gotta feel me {"I shot you down"}
Lord forgive me but he tried to kill me {"Bang bang"}
Somebody out there gotta feel me {"You hit the ground"}

Lord forgive me but he tried to kill me {"Bang bang"}
Somebody out there gotta feel me {"I shot you down"}
Lord forgive me but he tried to kill me {"Bang bang"}
Somebody out there gotta feel me {"That awful sound"}
