[Intro/Interlude]
"D-D-Do you, do-do, do you think about me?"
"Do you, do you, do you think about me?"
"Do you think, do you think, do-do-do you think about me?"
"Do you, do you, do you, do you think about me?"

[50 Cent]
Uhh, yeah
You think about money when you think about me, huh?
It's why my ex my ex, you don't wan' be her
She used to have the Beemer, now she own a sneaker
I had her eatin lobster, now she eatin pizza
I think about Easter when I think about Keyshia
Shorty stay fly, that's why I keep her
Round like the reefer, brown Mona Lisa
She good if I leave her, she got her own Visa
Think about them when you think about frontin
Think about stuntin when you think about me
I'm the boss, Bentley or the Porsche?
Overseas see jet skis slide across
I love the way you dress, now take it off
Put your legs high on my shoulders of course
I'm racin through your mind, but you already lost
I'm at the finish line, and you're a friend of mine
C'mon let's ride

[Chorus: Governor]
{"Do you think about me?"}
Just a little bit, every now and then
{"Do you think about me?"}
Goddamn girl! We used to be friends
{"Do you think about me?"}
Just a little bit, just a little bit
{"Do you think about me?"}
Just a little bit, just a little bit!
{"Do you think about me?"}

[50 Cent]
I think like a hustler, I'm thinkin 'bout a shipment
She thinkin I'm her hustler, she thinkin 'bout commitment
It's like Paul McCartney's stuck in my head
He fell in love with one bitch who walked away on one leg
She ain't even have to run to get away with the bread
That's some fucked up shit, think about that kid
I'm thinkin "What this bitch thinkin when she take me to court?
I pay my child support, what the fuck she want?"
This relationship shit is too much for me
I wanna fuck, be friends and live comfortably
She wanna shine and blow mines on shoppin sprees
She should have what she want, just not from me
I'm thinkin 'bout my future, she brought up my past
She don't care about me, she just want some cash
I'm thinkin damn, girl we used to be friends
How did shit become all about ends?

[Chorus]

[Governor]
(Do you think about meeeee?) Do you think about me?
(I know you think about meeeee)
You GOT to remember all the good times we had!
Just a little bit, just a little bit
Just a little bit, just a little bit
Just a little bit, just a little bit
Just a little bit!
(Oooooooooooooh, do you think about meeeee?)
I remember when you told me
(I know you think about meeeee)
That I'll ALWAYYYYYS be special to you darlin
You were so special to me, do you think about me?
Ohhh
