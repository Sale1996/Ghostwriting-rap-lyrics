[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I got big bags of paper I'ma spennnnd, uhhh
We gon' do it how we do it then do the shit againnnn, uhhh
You should fuck with a winner bitch if you wanna winnnn, uhhh
We celebratin like a nigga home fresh out the pen, uhhh

[50 Cent]
I'm on, bitches all on my john
To get bread and don't blow bread, the fuck is the point?
Call me Elroy, I be on some Jetson shit
Pop a X then a blue pill then wreck a bitch
I like it raw; ooh baby ohh baby I like it raw
Take a chill pill bright and early tomorrow
The morning after, plan B, no kids involved
Please no kids involved
I put that money in a vault bitch, Usain Bolt quickness
But let's make a deal then blow mil's for real
Uh, time's a-wastin, you're watchin my watch, huh?
You're old school, huh? You're jockin my style, uhh

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
I don't give a flyin fuck, I always make bail
Motherfuck an award, check Forbes I'm there
Not once, e-ve-ry year!
Even when I take a break my pockets is in shape
I'm back off of vacation
Can you believe it I been gettin paid on vacation?
Yeah, I'ma keep niggaz forever hatin
They thought I'm goin down now look I'm levitatin
I'm with Deepak, meditatin
In Somalia and Kenya with United Nations
Fundin the World Food Programme
I'm fin' to solve world hunger, goddamn!

[Chorus]
