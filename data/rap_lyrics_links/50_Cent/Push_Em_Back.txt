[Intro]
(It's about to go dooown!) Git out the way, git out the way
(Betta move, it's about to go dooown!) Git out the way, git out the way
You betta move 50 feet shawty (Yuh!), let a nigga thru

Push em back!

Make the club, push em back! (C'monn!)
Push em back!
Push em back!
Push em back!
Push em back!
Push em back!
Push em back!
Push em back!

[Verse 1]
Ain't no body goin' broke, err' body sellin' dope
Err' body gittin' money, it's some niggas tellin' no
We ain't talkin' on the phone, I don't know, I ain't certain ya
No body neva heard-a ya, you fuckin' wit' some murderas
Look at my wrist (Wrist!), look at my bitch
She hold daddy down, help a nigga git rich (Yeah!)
This Patron got me hot, the Phantom in the 'lot
See this pill kickin' in, and I'm standin' wit' my glock
In this bitch like Woo, I need some elbow room
Got me spillin' liquer at the club, flow so soon
Burn this bitch up, we 'bout to +Get Buck+
Gimme the light, tell the DJ turn my shit up (It's on now)

[Chorus]
Gimme 50 feet shawty (Yuh!), let a nigga thru
If you don't wann' move, ya know what I'ma 'bout to do (Aye!)
I push em back!
Push em back!
Push em back!
Push em back!
Push em back!
Push em back!
Push em back!
Push em back! (Yeaahh!)
Git out my way, we ballin' like (Ayye!)
I'm throwin' money, I can take it wit' me anyway
Make the club, push em back! (C'monn!)
Push em back!
Push em back!
Push em back!
Push em back!
Push em back!
Push em back!
Push em back!

[Verse 2]
Cup full of Hennessey, my niggas call it Gasoline
Pussy niggas fill up, and say shit they don't mean
Stuntin' wit'cha real money, dat'll git'chu killed
See prolly wann' this paper, my baby needs some milk
Bitch we built this city, the dope boi commited
I still got the nerds to sell it up, and come and git it
A product of the projects, my momma's only son
Made my 1st million dollas, and a new drama would come
Didn't run from it (Yuh!), I ran to it (Yuh!)
I'm not playin' bout The Unit, and my fans knew it
Now make the lane for me, 'cause I deserve this
I wonder what my enemies git when they hurr this (Let's Goo!)
Ha-ha

[Chorus]
Gimme 50 feet shawty (Yuh!), let a nigga thru
If you don't wann' move, ya know what I'ma 'bout to do (Aye!)
I push em back!
Push em back!
Push em back!
Push em back!
Push em back!
Push em back!
Push em back!
Push em back! (Yeaahh!)
Git out my way, we ballin' like (Ayye!)
I'm throwin' money, I can take it wit' me anyway
Make the club, push em back! (C'monn!)
Push em back!
Push em back!
Push em back!
Push em back!
Push em back!
Push em back!
Push em back!

[Hook]
You don't no problems, you don't wanna see me nigga (Aye, Aye!)
You don't no problems, you don't wanna see me nigga (Aye, Aye!)
You don't no problems, you don't wanna see me nigga (Aye, Aye!)
You don't no problems, you don't wanna see me (Aye, Aye!)

[Verse 3]
Gotta runna gramms 50 (Yuh!), and my A.K. wit' me
If a mothafucka hit me, I'ma KNOCK HIS HEAD OFF!!
I ain't scared non of y'all, bitch I'm runnin' from the law (Whudd!)
Put'cha trigga fingas up, if ya wann' KNOCK THEY HEAD OFF!!
Push-a-weight, all thru the state
It's like I speed-up, when they tell me "But my brakes!" (Aye!)
If I told chu what I make err' time I flip a key
You would prolly try to take the same trip dat I did, but'chu can't (Ayye)

[Chorus]
Gimme 50 feet shawty (Yuh!), let a nigga thru
If you don't wann' move, ya know what I'ma 'bout to do (Aye!)
