[Verse One: 50 Cent]
Try to remain calm, you fuckin with a don
Pocket full of green, green in the bong
That bitch with the bowlegged stance turnin me on
Two mill time these rainbows to be on
Niggas still want me dead like Osam
But they ain't 'gon make it they come at me wrong
Them niggas all workers who smack the shit out they bosses
Ferrari I'm stronger than five hundred horses
Money is power you niggas better wake up
My earrings blinkin that's old shit from Jacob
Add it up four plus four that's eight karats
You can't run and get your bid you ain't got it
Blackjack, we do that ten grand a hand
You could get shot fuckin with Floyd that's my man
Billionaire brotherhood we call this the money team
Pinky ring flawless my god I'm gorgeous

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Remain calm, you fuckin with a don
Remain calm, hoe, remain calm
Remain calm, you fuckin with a don
Remain calm, don't, ring the alarm
Remain calm, you fuckin with a don
Remain calm, nigga, remain calm
Remain calm, you fuckin with a don
Remain calm, this a al quaeda bomb

[Verse Two: Snoop Dogg]
I'm chillin like a villian while I'm dealin I am
Rulin while I'm coolin with the tool in my hand
Post up, coast up, this is my life bitch
Up close homey you get stuck with a knife bitch
Cuz burnt out, turnt out like a light switch
Got alot of hoes, but Charmaine that's my white bitch
The rest of my bitches nah they ain't gonna like this
But I don't give a fuck 'cause they all love this night stick
But I still remain calm, bang and drop bombs
Collar popped up, cool as The Fonze
Motherfucker! Have a seat and loosen up
Get a glass of some gin, now juice it up, deuces up
See it's a line there for a reason
And if you cross it, no more breathin, ya leavin
Believe it, we understand each other?
'Cause I would hate to have to put a slug in ya brotha, ya dig?

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Remain calm, you fuckin with a don
Remain calm, hoe, remain calm
Remain calm, you fuckin with a don
Remain calm, don't, ring the alarm
Remain calm, you fuckin with a don
Remain calm, nigga, remain calm
Remain calm, you fuckin with a don
Remain calm, this a al quaeda bomb

[Verse Three: Precious Paris]
When Fif on that shit, that glock, cocks in your face
My twat, cocks in your face, you know you want taste
Alexander McQueen strapless with my back out
Six inch Davinci's a bitch fittin to act out
Niggas on my heels tryin to find out what that head like
I know what that bread like my bucky yard head like
Shine like I shine, night or daytime
My na, na na na na, make a nigga want buy everything I say buy
My na na na na, get wet I got that come back that crack
My assets, is my ass jack
Stunt I tell my niggas right, where your stash at
You fuckin with a Southside bitch, I go where the money go
I'm mad damn I put her on the stroll, get my money hoe
Catch me at Farrow Gahmer or Dolce & Gabbana
Or my Trigaliano I'm p squared up, what!

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
Remain calm, you fuckin with a don
Remain calm, hoe, remain calm
Remain calm, you fuckin with a don
Remain calm, don't, ring the alarm
Remain calm, you fuckin with a don
Remain calm, nigga, remain calm
Remain calm, you fuckin with a don
Remain calm, this a al quaeda bomb
