[Intro: 50 Cent & Jeremih]
If he's your number one, and he's your everything
Why would you pick up the phone? When I call girl talk to me

[Verse One: 50 Cent]
You know you won't play with a nigga
I'll fly you out, to spend a day with a nigga
First flight, first seat in first class
First pair of Giseppe's, first Bercou bag (WOOOOOOOO!!!!)
I'm Street King, see you be fit for a king
When you step out on the scene it's Alexander McQueen
This a ghetto fairytale I be your knight in shinnin armor
In retro Jordan's, Giselle's, and a leather bomber (Yeah!)
Bright lights, city life, I show you 'round New York a bit
From hot dogs and pretzels to the expensive shit
Girl we could shop, 'til my nickname's Sak's Fifth 
Madison Ave. mind frame baby I stack chips
Smile, my cell phone a capture the moment 
When your emotions start to shift I'm a just shoot that over
Your brown eyes them chocolate thighs, make me wanna say good lord
Is this Adam and Eve happenin again

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Jeremih]
We can kick it all day, all night, twist it up, get right
Let me know if you with it (HEYYY!!!)
Got kush in my hood, so good, roll it up, backwoods
Can't wait to let you hit it
Now you in my, worrrrrrrrrlllllllddddddddddd!!!!!
Now you in my, worrrrrrrrrlllllllddddddddddd!!!!!
Planet (Planet) 50 (50)

[Verse Two: 50 Cent]
Listen shorty this is my fault play without the touchin
You could say it's my fault Tae, I feel ya comin
Mind, sex, a make you wanna take your clothes off
Yep! Twenty twenty go for bed I'm feelin that concept 
I want the best, now can you best for me?
Can my vision and your ambition make the perfect recipe?
Let's take a walk on the wild side 
And chat 'til your body language is sayin boy come get this cat
In my mind ten times I'd done took of your clothes off
Your thinkin what I'm thinkin let me know it's a go
I'm a gamblin man talkin 'bout life not dice
And that look in your eyes sayin it's goin down tonight
You could show me what you into, as I get into
Kissin lickin switchin positions actin like a nympho
Round after round I show you how I put it down
Jet set mile high club in the clouds 

[Chorus: 50 Cent & Jeremih]
We can kick it all day, all night, twist it up, get right
Let me know if you with it (HEYYY!!!)
Got kush in my hood, so good, roll it up, backwoods
Can't wait to let you hit it
Now you in my, worrrrrrrrrlllllllddddddddddd!!!!!
Now you in my, worrrrrrrrrlllllllddddddddddd!!!!!
