[Intro]
I'm so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful
I'm so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful

[Verse One]
Your daddy fucked your mama then fucked your sister
Then climbed in the bed playin with your sugar
Go 'head, take your belt off and hang yourself
Matter a fact grab your strap and bang yourself
Jay's a big man, he's too big to respond
I'm a big dick you know the one everybody's on
You 'gon make me sing Murder Was The Case
Pull this richter shit PING PING should you start to face
I'm international I'm never home mayne!!!
I've been gone so long my accent changed
You better watch who you fuck with mate
Or you 'gon make me carve your ass up now straight
Come on Game you will never be my equal!
Your homies shoot, doors my niggas shoot people!
See me I'm what you never 'gon be
I'm in that tax bracket you never 'gon see

[Chorus]
When you cross me, I'm so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful
See! I get so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful
When you cross me, I'm so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful
See! I get so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful

[Verse Two]
That nigga Buck a fiend, tell momma he done smoked the TV
I ain't know he fucked with more dope than B.G.
Plus a nigga sipped more syrup than Pepsi
Man keepin these muthafuckers rich ain't easy
Especially when a nigga wanna stunt like Jeezy
And his CDs' didn't sell like his CDs'
Man, that nigga blew all of his chips on dem breezies
Mad 'cause the world won't treat him like Weezy
Look I don't give a FUCK, nigga please believe me
No nigga in no vocal booth around can see me
It's crazy how I make this shit look oh so easy
They say, "50, naw I don't fuck wit him, he oh so greasy
Yeah, he used to share that paper now he oh so greedy"
It's funny how they shit on niggas, then they need me
See me I'm number one, I'm loadin up my gun
I catch ya if you done, you pussy nigga run

[Chorus]
When you cross me, I'm so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful
See! I get so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful
When you cross me, I'm so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful
See! I get so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful

[Verse Three]
They say first comes love, then comes marriage
Instead I got Shanequa in a baby carriage
Then came the cash then the baby mama drama
I gave that bitch a half a mill she blew it on Prada
I remember when I met the bitch and she ain't have nada
Got my son on some fly shit, now I gotta buy shit
Man I can't even flaunt shit cause everybody want shit
Everybody mad, DAMN even my dad
And I don't even know him now how the fuck I owe him?!
I ain't given nobody shit I'm a show them
I gave Game hits and told me to suck dick
Start screamin Westside and Dre ain't say shit!!!
Now we just eat off him, and when I talk to Em
A smile comes on his face, he told me here's the case
Enemies stay enemies but friends they change
Niggas go crazy over money my mayne!!!!

[Chorus]
When you cross me, I'm so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful
See! I get so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful
When you cross me, I'm so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful
See! I get so disrespectful, so so so disrespectful
