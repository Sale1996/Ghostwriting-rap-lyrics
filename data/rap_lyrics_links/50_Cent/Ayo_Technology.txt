[Intro: 50 Cent]
Somethin special, unforgettable 
50 Cent (Cent) Justin (Tin) Timbaland (Land) God Damn (Damn)
She-She-She want it, I wanna give it to her
She know that... it's right here for her
I wanna,  see her break it down
I'm ballin, throwin money 'round

[Verse 1: 50 Cent]
She a workin girl, she work the pole, she break it down, she take it low
She fine as hell, she 'bout the dough, she doin her thing out on the flo'
Her money money, she make it make it, look at the way she shake it shake it
Make you wanna touch it, make you wanna taste it
Have you lustin for it goin crazy face it 
Now don't stop, get it get it, the way she shake it make you wanna hit it
Think she double jointed from the way she split it 
Got your head fucked up from the way she did it
She so much more than you used to, she know just how to move to seduce you
She 'gon do the right thing and touch the right spot
And dance in your lap till you ready to pop
She always, ready, when you want it she want it
Like a nympho, the info, I'll show you where to meet her
On the late night, till daylight, the club jumpin
If you want a good time, she 'gon give you what you want
Let me talk to you

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Baby your so new age, your like my new craze
Let's get together baby we can start a new phase
This smoke's got the club all hazy spotlights don't do you justice baby
Why don't you come over here? You got me sayin
Ayo!!!! I'm tired of usin technology
Why don't you sit down on top of me?
Ayo!!!! I'm tired of usin technology

(Oooh Oooh!!!) She wants it, so I gotta give it to her
(Oooh Oooh!!!) She wants it, uh, uh, she wants it
(Oooh Oooh!!!) She wants it, so I gotta give it to her

[Timbaland]
Your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized
Let me tell you your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized 
Let me tell you your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized 
Let me tell you your hips, your thighs, they got me hypnotized

[Verse 2: 50 Cent]
Got a thang for, that thang she got
The way she make it tick, the way she make it pop
I make it rain for her so she don't stop
I ain't got to move, I can sit and watch
In the fantasy, it's plain to see, just how it be, her and me
Backstrokin, sweat soakin, all into my satin sheets
When she ready to ride, I'm ready to roll
I'll be in this bitch till the club close
Watchin her do her thing on all fours
Now that that there should be against the law
From side to side, left to right, break it down, down, down
Know I like, when your hype, and you throw it all around
Different style, different mood, damn I like the way you move
Girl you got me thinkin 'bout, all the things I'll do to you
Let's get it poppin shawty we could switch positions
From the couch to the counters in my kitchen
Let me talk to you

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Baby you so new age, your like my new craze
Let's get together baby we can start a new phase
This smoke's got the club all hazy spotlights don't do you justice baby
Why don't you come over here? You got me sayin
Ayo!!!! I'm tired of usin technology
Why don't you sit down on top of me?
Ayo!!!! I'm tired of usin' technology
I need you right in front of me
(Oooh Oooh!!!) She wants it, uh, uh, she wants it
(Oooh Oooh!!!) She wants it, so I gotta give it to her
(Oooh Oooh!!!) She wants it, uh, uh, she wants it
(Oooh Oooh!!!) She wants it, so I gotta give it to her
