[Chorus: 50 Cent]
She make me want it want it
On the late night or in the mornin mornin
I wanna be where she wanna be
She is the definition of sexy to me
I'm fin' to push up on it on it
Yeah, let her know that I want it want it
She wanna be where I wanna be
She is the definition of sexy to me

[50 Cent]
Seduction, I'm stuck when
she get to battin her eyes, she work the thick in her thighs
It's perfect, it's worth it
I do what I got to get it, I ain't trippin, shit I'm with it
I put it down when I hit it, she'll be so happy she did it
I bet she'll never forget it, in bed I'm like a wizard
Sorta exquisite, she'll wanna visit over and over and over
Her body's a map, I'm the guide, I'm just here to show her
how I get to that G-spot, non-stop
Tick tock, time fly, hella fun, no lie
Oh I know I can give her what she need
Slow mo' or high speed, ecstacy true indeed

[Chorus] w/ ad libs

[50 Cent]
You can hear us from the next room when we go at it
I started her addiction, she got a habit
She gotta have it, I'm always on my job
I work it nice and hard, I mean I work it how she want
She my homie lover friend, yeah she might just bring her other friend
Feel the rush, adrenaline'll make a nigga head spin
I say just keep it simple baby, we ain't got to complicate it
If you want it and I want it maybe we should have it maybe
We got one life to live, it's precious the time we share
Now call me when you're in need, baby girl I'll be there
Fo' sho' in me, you can confide
I'm a rider twenty-fo'/seven, ready to ride - yeah

[Chorus] w/ ad libs
