[Intro: 50 Cent]
I don't even know what to say, I ain't got to say much
Hear my voice, you know it's 50

[2 Chainz]
Damn right I got it, damn right I got it

[Verse One: 2 Chainz]
I said lame niggaz be quiet, lame niggaz be quiet, lame niggaz be quiet
You in the presence of a real nigga
I said lame niggaz be quiet, lame niggaz be quiet, lame niggaz be quiet
You in the real nigga presence
I eat your girl up for breakfast, won't save you no extra
Say she fuckin with me cause a real nigga's her preference
Drink like I'm from Texas, and you know I stay flexin
And if you don't know I go by Tity 2 Necklace

[Verse Two: 50 Cent]
Nigga that's cocaine that I'm flippin (YEAH!)
Wood-Wood grain when I'm pimpin (GRRRR!!!!)
C-C-Codeine when I'm sippin bitch you fuckin right I be trippin (WOOOO!!!)
I put your bitch face on my lap, two two threes all in my strap
Count-Count my paper all of them stacks fuck-fuck some up then get it right back
NIG-NIGGA TRY ME!!!!!!

[Chorus: 2 Chainz]
I'ma start a riot, I'ma start a riot {*4X*}

[Verse Three: 2 Chainz]
Ain't stuntin these niggaz, ain't stuntin these bitches
Two cigarillos, look like extensions
Yeah I'm from the Southside, her mouth wide, my pack loud
My gat loud I back out, and click clack, pow pow
Court dates, skip trial, my rep is a reptile
An hour later, alligators, I stepped on the work like a stepchild
Pimps up, hoes down, make your girl pull her clothes down
Her hair down and I'm down, her phone off so don't dial

[Verse Four: 50 Cent]
That-That pyrex in my kitchen (Kitchen) Rich nigga still pitchin (Pitchin)
Them GD's and them Vice Lords love that gangsta shit that I be kickin (Kickin)
Who Blood now who Crippin?! (Crippin) Who pussy tell me who snitchin (Snitchin)
I got a firearm the fire on whoever done let that bitch in (Bitch in)
These-These niggas don't live by the codes, look how they done fucked up the game
Throw your sets up, if you don't give a fuck, It's 50 and 2 Chainz
Got the hood back poppin now thanks to this, I buy the whole bar nigga you can drank to this
Get the bottles poppin while the hoes watchin man damn I love this gangsta shit
Gang-Gangsta shit! 

[Chorus: 2 Chainz
I'ma start a riot, I'ma start a riot {*4X*}

[Outro: 50 Cent]
We 'gon get back to the real shit!
