shorty you ain't gotta take your panties off just pull em to the side
if you wanna ride on the roller coaster baby come and ride
it go up and down round and round stand up or get on the floor
it's on tonight I know whatcha like I know just how to break ya off

good evening ladies - I tell ya from the start
I hope you enjoy my amusement park
there's lots of activities fun things to do
and I'll find my pleasure in pleasing you
some rides go fast some rides go fast
you fear heights when I'm high hell yeah I'll go low
it tastes so sweet that sticky cotton candy
we get carried away we be starting a family
it's a perfect time for a magic trick
girl you know it's no fun without the magic stick
now watch me as I pull a rabbit out a hat
then we can use the rabbit all over your cat
applause now that's the first half of my act
I started out a pimp now I'm more like a mack
I don't need your paper just don't fuck with my stacks
(oh it's like that?) yeah it's like that

shorty you ain't gotta take your panties off just pull em to the side
if you wanna ride on the roller coaster baby come and ride
it go up and down round and round stand up or get on the floor
it's on tonight I know whatcha like I know just how to break ya off

now you can ride the horse around the carousel
explosions trojans all in the hotel
put me to the test I don't fail
I work it out without a doubt
there's plenty water rides I'm sure to get you wet in the park
having lusting seductions considered an art
throw a hoop around the bottle I'll be your teddy bear
whatever you color you like you know I don't care
I really gotta thank ya for attending this affair
now go encourage your friends to come and have fun here
I smile when I speak but I'm being sincere
and your pass is valid all summer my dear
so at your convenience you can always return
there's so many tricks to the trade you should learn
suck that lick that swallow that lollipop
forget that grip that ride it nonstop

shorty you ain't gotta take your panties off just pull em to the side
if you wanna ride on the roller coaster baby come and ride
it go up and down round and round stand up or get on the floor
it's on tonight I know whatcha like I know just how to break ya off
