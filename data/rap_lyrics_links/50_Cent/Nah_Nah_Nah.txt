[Intro: 50 Cent]
Got the shotgun, got the handgun
Got the paper in my Nike box
Burn the haze up, better raise up
'Fore you get your punk ass shot

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
We hunt 'em down, and gun 'em down
Cut 'em down to the floor - nah nah nah
You fuck around, the tre-pound
That's six rounds for the raw - nah nah nah
We on the trip, fuck up a flip
Hundred grams of the raw - nah nah nah
We on the shit, we spit a clip
At your whip homeboy - nah nah nah

[50 Cent]
Yeah I run the town like a marathon, track star, trap star
Teflon shock plate, front and back, uhh
P-90 Ruger talk, 38-special flow
Hollow-tip, Prada shit, flyest nigga in New York
C-4 in the function, the bomb niggaz frontin
I got it like they want it so they hatin when I'm stuntin
I'm hot now, I'm bigger than the block now
Rolls drop top down, Lambo top down
Violate get shot down, I live by the codes you follow
I jux somethin nigga 'fore I beg or borrow
I come from the street where there's strong and there's weak
And when the strong hungry the weak's somethin to eat

[Chorus]

[Tony Yayo]
Yeah, this rap shit is fake if you really wanna ask me
I'm in the projects with a bitch like Cassie
Drop top Maybach, the roof all glassy
Level two vest on cause niggaz wanna blast me
I'm a menace to society, that's what the judge said
My kind of money leave the D.A. and the judge dead
Shorty turned 5 and he rep that 5
Shorty just turned 6 and he rep that 6
I got my crack and my fo'-fo' 'til fo' in the morning
Gas up the truck, fuck, global warming
My money be foreign, my cars be foreign
It's pedal to the medal in them Air Force Jordans

[Chorus]

[Tony Yayo]
Yeah, fo' bitches in the European whip +Set it Off+ like Cleo
Haitian bitches talkin Creole
Rappers feindin to ball, triple-header, Christmas day
Navy blue Phantom Ghost, box for the pistol play
Why Comrade Mary overdose on M.J.?
Why Big ain't have a bullet-proof truck like me?
Why the club shot up? What the fuck you expect?
They don't search niggaz buyin bottles at Juliet
Yeah I just left Southside, I'm Teterboro{?} Westside
Money team live the dream, haters tryin to strategize
We work hard, this ain't come easy
Bitch slob me in the coupe, yeah I cum easy

[Chorus]
