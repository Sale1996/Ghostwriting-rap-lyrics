[50 Cent]
She loves me, she loves me not (yeah)
She loves me not

The fiends need me
I aint around, they bones ache
Detox, rehab, cold sweats, watch them shake
I'm not that genie in a bottle, I'm in a bag
Take one hit and slide off to the Land of H man
When we first met, I thought you never doubt me
Now you tryin' to leave me, you never live without me
Girl I'm missing you, come and see me soon
Tie your arm up; put that lighter under that spoon
Now put that needle to ya arm princess
Stick it in, relapse
I'm back bitch, don't ever try that again
All the shit I did for you, I made you feel good
We have a love thing, you treatin' this like it's just a fling
What we have is more sacred than a vow or a ring
You broke my heart you dirty bitch
I won't forget what you did
If you give birth, I'll already be in love with your kids
Listen I don't give a damn if your ass starts smokin'
But we have a bond that is not to be broken

[Chorus: repeat 2X] 
We got a love thing
Girl you tried to leave me but you need me
Can you see you're addicted to me?
We got a love thing
I can take ya higher girl
Fuckin' with me, you can be all you can be

[50 Cent]
Baby you know, on the low, ya sister been eyein' me
I'm good lookin', so you know so she be tryin' me
Heard she bi-sexual, she fuck what that girl
But boy oh boy, fuckin' wit me is a whole 'nother world
After that first night she fall in love, then chase the feelin
I hung out with Marvin when he wrote Sexual Healing
Kurt Cobain, we were good friends, Ozzy Osbourne too
I be with rock stars, see you lucky I'm fuckin' with you
I chilled with Frankie Lymon and Jimi Hendrix crew
See this is new to you, but to me this aint new
I live the lavish life
Listen if the mood is right
Me you and ya sister can do the do tonight
I never steer you wrong, if you hyper I make you calm
I'll be your incentive and your reason to make you move on
Let's make a date, promise you'll come to see me
Even if it means you have to sell ya mama's TV
I love you, love me back
No one said lovin' me be easy

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
I love you
I gotchu' bad footed on glass
Chasin a dove
That monkey on ya back symbolizes my love
Your friends talk bad about me, bitch
You sit there and listen to them
Over and over you hurt me
My love is unconditional
They talk to you when you up
When you down, then they got nothin' to say
But when you call up, I come runnin' 
I always take the pain away
They set you up to let you down
You crowned, you prom queen
They know bout me behind your back
Call you a fuckin' fiend
We just need to be alone so I can kiss and hug you
Push me inside you 
No other man can love you like I do
Call me daddy, I'll make you feel good, I mean real good
I find pleasure in pleasing you like a real man should
It was written long before us, it was carved in a tree
Forever me and you baby, we were meant to be
There's more to life than laughter, what brought us together was fate
But we'll be hand in hand when you walk through those pearly gates
I'ma see to that, I'ma do whatever it takes

[Chorus]
