[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
I'm a smoke all day, fuck all night
I think I'm coming, this is the life
I'm counting money, do what I like
Life is a gamble, just shoot the dice
Green money keeps chrome wheels turning
White and black girls popping and purple weed burning
What I do with my time don't concern 'em 
Middle finger cops, big money earning

[Lloyd Banks]
Come on
Everybody talking, but my conatour's the reason
I ain't gotta walk, I gotta ride
Hustle like my time is short
Surround my fort, hippo chopper karat
Damn if I get caught, get common sense to tell you 
I ain't playin', know how hard I fought?
Fuck these bitches, they be there when I get back
Back to the lab, mad, roll the chronic bag smokin' and scratchin' the pad
Calico rap when I'm mad had to go back to the rags
then he know I got to have, caddy doors over my swag
Fatties all over your back, you ain't half, bitch!
Diamonds shining everywhere, earrings, fingers, neck, wrist
White boat, jet six, seven when my album drop
These haters got a death wish and I can smell 'em round the block!

[Chorus: Lloyd Banks]
I'm a smoke all day, fuck all night
I think I'm coming, this is the life
I'm counting money, do what I like
Life is a gamble, just shoot the dice
Green money keeps chrome wheels turning
White and black girls popping and purple weed burning
What I do with my time don't concern 'em 
Middle finger cops, big money earning

[Lloyd Banks]
South side is where I got my style at, where they foul at
Where future's fucked up, and crying ladies want their child back
Born in the combat, I get it spent more behind that
This ho, we mind crack, contagious, avoid contact
I've been rhyme jack, lift away until I lost my mind at
Between a gat and a hard place, now erase all that
You haters fall back, cash money's my favorite door mat
I'm like colliding with a ball bat, the four-four claps
Pi√±a coladas where my drawers on and jewel born. love
Three friends, big tub, bet they all goin' run
They don't wanna scrub and I don't want no bird
Baby, text me until you catch me, let me breathe til' I catch that that herb

[Chorus 2x: Lloyd Banks]
I'm a smoke all day, fuck all night
I think I'm coming, this is the life
I'm counting money, do what I like
Life is a gamble, just shoot the dice
Green money keeps chrome wheels turning
White and black girls popping and purple weed burning
What I do with my time don't concern 'em 
Middle finger cops, big money earning
