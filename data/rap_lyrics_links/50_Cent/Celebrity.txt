[Intro: Akon]
Yeah!!! Heyyy!!! Yeah!! Uh huh!! Akon and Lloyd Banks!!!!
Ohhhhhh!!!! Ohhhhhh!!!! 

[Verse One: Lloyd Banks]
I just touched down Ferarri to concrete (Uh)
I ain't even home and they talkin about me (What)
Fuck out my ear if you talkin about free 
Nigga free don't pay the bills I'm ballin all out b!
These rappers don't know me, nah I ain't your homey
If your name ain't Em, Ferrari or Tony
I make my wheel chromey, my Bentley, my Rollie
My magnum, my forty, South Jamaica shorty
These races I took in the gut yo
The roach still here I'm just cookin it up slow
Clear my mind I'm whippin the truck low 
My pop dead, but he live through his son though
If rap ain't work, I be pimpin on some hoe
Still eatin lobster and shrimp in the bungalow
I'm back like crack, over the drum roll
You know, wherever I go the gun go

[Chorus: Akon] (*Lloyd Banks)
We on the grind (HEY!!!) All the time (HEY!!!)
Ain't 'bout to let a nigga come and snatch mine (HEY!!!)
I keep a nine (HEY!!!) You see the shine (HEY!!!)
I might let your ass slide this time
While I get this papeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!! Papeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!
While I get this papeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!! Papeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!
'Cause I'm a celebrity (*I don't need none of y'all!!!)
Ghetto celebrity! (*Keep your punk ass awards!!!)
I'm a celebrity! (*Take your fake smiles off!!!)
Ghetto celebrity! Ain't nothin changed nigga!!!

[Verse Two: Lloyd Banks]
Yeah! The media will test ya popularity is pressure
Porche or Panoram a platinum hammer through their measure
Wreck a booth up I'm too tough, that inner city grammer
Step your jewels up, they bruised up, I sparkle for the camera
Harsh reality is what's closin and holdin the Mac from openin
Verbal attack all over these niggas push the herbs to the back
I'm the kind that they prey on, spendin half of they day on
They on niggas for days 'til shots spray on
My sound system knock and it pound 2Pac
Six four jumpin like the ground too hot
The spot near chase a nigga down two blocks
Two shots in the air for niggas that ain't hear 
Two tone two door, green top, blue floor
Green gwop galore, in and out a new whore
The bright lights you saw, was a paparazzi flash
Tryin to snap a picture through your Maserati glass

[Chorus: Akon] (*Lloyd Banks)
We on the grind (HEY!!!) All the time (HEY!!!)
Ain't 'bout to let a nigga come and snatch mine (HEY!!!)
I keep a nine (HEY!!!) You see the shine (HEY!!!)
I might let your ass slide this time
While I get this papeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!! Papeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!
While I get this papeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!! Papeeeerrrrrrrrrrrrr!!!!
'Cause I'm a celebrity (*I don't need none of y'all!!!)
Ghetto celebrity! (*Keep your punk ass awards!!!)
I'm a celebrity! (*Take your fake smiles off!!!)
Ghetto celebrity! Ain't nothin changed nigga!!!

[Outro: Akon]
Ain't nothin changed nigga!!!  Ain't nothin changed nigga!!!
Ain't nothin changed nigga!!!  Ain't nothin changed nigga!!!
