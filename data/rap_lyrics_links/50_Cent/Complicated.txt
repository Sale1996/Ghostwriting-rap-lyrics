[Intro]
Yeah! You see a nigga soft, my first instinct is to lean on him
A weak nigga eatin in my hood niggas say put a beam on him
These niggas ain't supposed to be eatin yo, they sweet as Sweet'N Low
I'll have him like shit was all good just a week ago

[Verse One]
This is Fif niggas get you in the mood for love
I'm back to get you in the mood for the snub and gloves
Dope fiend, morphone, cocaine dilemma
Crack come to cook it up back boy I'm a chemist
Fuck pill poppin that strap I pop that
Watch the Henchmen trial see a rat, rat on a rat
He got a nice gimmick goin you been hot a few summers
But I got that kinda flow that could stop world hunger
SK I got nothin but energy
Call me 50 call me Ferrari the remedy
Hi again incase a hater don't remember me
I happen to be what these rap niggas they pretend to be
Hittin you won't be enough you gotta finish me
Or it's rueger time, the S-R nine
Frank missed ricochet and your ass go blind
Time's up your fucked, gotta learn to duck, what's up?!

[Chorus]
Don't make me! Don't make me! Don't make me!  
Seem so complicated
Don't make me! Don't make me! Don't make me!  
Show you what's up, don't make me fuck you up
    
[Verse Two]
Listen every bitch on the milk box ain't missin
I mean some of these hoes runnin 'round with pimpin
I'm writin reality it sounds harsh, Shyne tried to get at me he sounds washed
I ain't even fired back the shit's squashed
What kind of shit is that this only happens in rap
These niggas so fake it make my skin crawl
Hope I ain't the last real nigga up over the wall
Ice touchin the chain, waves spinnin, cream linen
Poses from the benjamins in 'em
Time forward, oh lord
If I ain't no better I think a nigga pushed raw
It feels like it's never gonna stop
A nigga so hot, i may spend forever on top
Forever ever, forever in a drop
Can't tell I got it on lock? BITCH!!!!!

[Chorus]
Don't make me! Don't make me! Don't make me!  
Seem so complicated
Don't make me! Don't make me! Don't make me!  
Show you what's up, don't make me fuck you up
