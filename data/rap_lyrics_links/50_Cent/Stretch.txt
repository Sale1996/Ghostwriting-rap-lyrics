[Chorus: 50 Cent]
I take grams of coke, mix it with lactose
That's what I do - streeeeetch
I make a ounce of dope with like a eighth of dope
befo' I'm through - product streeeeetch
I got it mastered man
In the hood I'm like plastic mannn - streeeeetch
Fantastic man
I make the money come faster man, yeahhh

[50 Cent]
Your favorite bad guy's gone, the Joker's dead
So from now until forever you're stuck with the kid
I ain't supposed to be a boss, I'm supposed to be an enforcer
I'm supposed to hold a gun, not be stuck in the office
Michael pimped me? I was in the passenger seat
He was comfortable with me 'round cause I blast my heat
'9-4 I was tryin to catch Mason for bricks of raw
Charlie fucked up the jux, they took Nana's little boy - streeeeetch
The cocaine, I go hard when the drought come
When the straps come out son niggaz know the outcome
Lay low, stay low, you may see Jesus
Get hit with a stray yo for no fuckin reason
You prayin for a Benz, it's a blessin you breathin
It's a miracle that God gave me this tec, now I'm eatin
Cop it, chop it, profit is all for sale
Cocaine, +Candy Rain+, I'm Soul for Real, yeah

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
I'm the dope man, coke man, smoke man, whatever man
The X man, tec man, you better respect man
Get the cream, triple beam, inf' beam, murder scheme
Fiend, morphine, dream, codeine, mo' lean
Gun pop, one shot, body drop, it wasn't me
Tell the cops it wasn't me, you saw me right? It wasn't me
It's not my M.O., see me I make it streeeeetch
Get in the way I'll put a body on my teeeeec
Call me crazy, I'll die for what I stand for
I'll have ammo flyin out the Lambo
Like Commando, nah, like Rambo
I keep my cool as long as the fuckin grams go
Woopty-woo, I'm a +Chef+ like Rae
It's hot in here, I'm by the stove cookin crack all day
Streeeeetch - we gon' bag up all night
We ain't goin nowhere 'til the count back right, yeahhh

[Chorus]

[50 Cent]
It's a bird, it's a plane, no it's pure cocaine
Tryna blow sellin blow I'm who you fuck with mayne
I got Spiderman high, I made Batman fly
Your favorite hero took a hit, now here you try
I don't care if it's a sin, I don't care if you're ten
Look around kid, it's a cold world we're in
If you ask me my offer is extremely handsome
A little Charlie, Marley, a little bit of Manson
Yeahhh, me fallin off is really farfeeeeetched
I turn a little to a lot, I make it streeeeetch
In come the Franklins, then come the Benji's
Fiends by the crackhouse, dirty and dingy - yeahhh

[Chorus]
