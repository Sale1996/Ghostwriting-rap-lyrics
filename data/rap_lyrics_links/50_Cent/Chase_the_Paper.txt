[Intro: 50 Cent]
Ohhhh, hey, ohhhh, hey
I'm still a rider, I'm still rollin
A nigga still holdin steel, that's how I'm on it
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You a sucker for love, nigga I'm money makin

[50 Cent]
I'm still a bona, I'm still ballin
It's five times I ain't pick up, your bitch still callin
I'm super ghetto, I'm still with the shit
Still pass the steel to my nigga, hit a lick~!
We still +Mobbin+, niggaz still starvin
We still deal after deal, shit is no problem
You still love her, she ain't shit
Get her a pair of Louboutins, she duck a dick
It's still real, niggaz +Still Will Kill+
Tote the steel, bitch don't squeal, get your cap peeled
The Mac filled, black talons, hollow tips, copper tops
Get ya ass popped, watch your body drop

[Chorus: 50 Cent]
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
I'm still a rider, I'm still rollin
A nigga still holdin steel, that's how I'm on it
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You chase the hoes, I chase the paper
You a sucker for love, nigga I'm money makin

[Kidd Kidd]
Watch this cuz

I'm clean as a muh'fucker still gettin my hands dirty
Bitches they wanna fuck, grab a glass, you lookin thirsty
See I'm a gangsta, you soft {?} as singers
I'm at awards with the banger, in a club with the shanker
Mask all on rangers, scope on the K long ranger
Rather be alive and rich, than die and be famous
Live my life in the fast lane, not crash into anythang
I ain't here to entertain when I let them bullets sang
M-Zone, Rida Gang, slap the fuck out you nigga
Tryna pull out your pistol, when you know that you're lame
You chasin these bitches, instead of chasin yo' paper
Niggaz takin yo' bitches, while they takin yo' paper
I'm gone (Kidd Kidd)

[Chorus]

[Prodigy]
Aiyyo fuck that bitch dunn~!

She on my leg, like a lil' kid
She hump my leg, like a horny bitch
Pit bull in a skirt, yeah I'm a magnet
Nah I ain't runnin after no broad, she stuck on my dick
I'm a different breed, blame it on my genes
Money in my jeans, pocket turn her eyes green
She seein dollar signs, I'm seein reasons why
I never had to stress no pussy, I'm one of a kind
Pretty nigga, with a gorgeous gun
You die a beautiful death, pull a stunt
Look; there ain't a bitch more down than me
The thirst is real, she knockin over drinks to get next to me
While you

[Chorus]

[Styles P]
Tryin to get this money, you know?

Ghetto nigga still'll pick a penny up
You outside chasin them hoes throwin your Henny up
Lil' homie loadin the semi up
Catch 'em all after the club, tell 'em to ante up
Anyway, each and every day
I'm lookin for a better way, you owe me you better pay
Ghost let the Beretta spray
Hood one uncut dope, and some better yay
I ain't chasin pussy, never have
Hustle hard, take a break, run and get some head and ass
Still ridin, still rollin, still need a mask
Still poppin, still slingin, still need the cash

[Chorus]
