[Intro]
Dre, niggas think we're bullshitting

[Chorus]
Nigga try me son, he best have the heat on him
Want my eyes closed, get to mopping the street with him
Boy I put your body in a bag, front on me, I'm on ya ass
I bring money to my niggas, that bring death to my enemies
I bring money to my niggas, that bring death to my enemies

[Verse 1]
Nigga front on me, the goons and goblins come out
Wishmaster hundred shot drums will run out
They dumb out, you heard of me, they call me big homie
Me, I make the register ring, I'm the cash cow
They make the hammers ring, you on your ass now
Hair trigger, stare nigga, yeah niggas'll flip
Six to a semi assault, let it off at your will
Here I is, where the money is, I still get biz
D's know about the beef, you going to still get did
It be your tombstone and your fucking grave they dig
Have that ass in the precinct trying to talk to the pigs
I'm like Damien nigga, when I start getting loose on you
Closest thing to Lucifer, you think you got a noose on you
I make it hard to breathe
I come where your hustle, air it out, make it hard to eat
Have you looking both ways like you crossing the street

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Niggas send me the wrong message, we going fucking kill the messenger
Your whole clique, hollow tips will tear up the best of you
This ain't +Tha Carter+ nigga, this is Sparta
It's harder, I die and be a martyr, respect me like your father
Let off a clip or let a case off
I have your pussy ass running like a race horse
Follow orders now, Yay shoot his face off
You can have one, blast one, it's mad fun
See how when you listen to me all of the cash come
I was born with the Tec, it's a birth defect
I was conceived in the bins, ended up in a Benz
This is what happens when have-nots turn into sasquatch
Let the gat pop, boogie down on the back blocks
It's horrific, nah it's terrific
I got it if you sniff it, go head nigga twist it
Get lifted, goddamn I'm gifted

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I tell them ride on them, then they ride on them
Get the line on them then squeeze the .9 on them
Head shot, .40 glock, blow his mind on him
They say ain't not a jooks, leave his shines on his
Now you can watch me, nigga like the police watch me
I move proper, go ahead catch a shell trying to stop me
That 4-30 Spider, carbon fibre
And my dog is like Al Qaeda, natural fighter
Rapid fire, you're sweet like apple cider
The Mack will fire, mask like Michael Myers
It's off the wire when I get on my bullshit
No smiles, no laughs, you gets no pass
You can explain to my niggas while they whoop your ass
My hands itch when the money comes, it's hard to explain it
Last time I itched like this a truckload came in
Get money, get bread, that's what I do kid

[Chorus]
