[Intro: woman on phone]
Hello? Yeah I just walked in
Yeah I'm good, you still workin?
Tonight, right now?
Did I go out? Yeah, I went out
I went, I went to a couple of clubs
I never went to bed, shit
Wine or water
You should see someone about a cold drink
I don't know, I'm delirious, night

[Drake]
Cups of the Ros√©
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
is happy with a good guy
But I been drinkin so much
That I'ma call her anyway, say

[Chorus: Drake]
Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had
I say fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you pick up I know he's not around, ohh-oh
(Are you drunk right now?)

[Interlude: Drake]
I'm just sayin you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately?
I'm just sayin you could do, better
And I'll start hatin only if you make me

[Drake]
Uh, cups of that XO
All my people been here
I see all of her friends here
Guess she don't have the time to kick it no more
Flights in the morning
What you doing that's so important?
I been drinkin so much
That I'ma call you anyway and say

[Chorus] + [Interlude]

[Drake]
I think I'm addicted to naked pictures
and sittin talkin 'bout bitches that we almost had
I don't think I'm conscious in makin monsters 
out of the women I sponsored 'til it all goes bad
But shit it's all good
We threw a party, yeah we threw a party
Bitches came over, yeah we threw a party
I was just callin cause they was just leavin
Talk to me please, don't have much to believe in
I need you right now, are you down to listen to me?
Too many drinks have been given to me
I got some women that's livin off me
Pay for their flights and hotels, I'm ashamed
Bad that you know them, I won't say no names
After a while girl they all seem the same
I've had sex four times this week, I'll explain
Havin a hard time adjustin to fame
Sprite in that mixture
I been talkin crazy girl, I'm lucky that you picked up
Lucky that you stayed on
I need someone to put this weight on

{*on phone*}
Well, I'm sorry
(Are you drunk right now?)

[Interlude]

{*on phone*}
You not gon' come?
I guess I'm 'bout to just, kick it here then

[Drake]
Just throw up while I hold yo' hurr back
Her white friend said "You niggaz crazy," I hope no one heard that
Yea, I hope no one heard that
Cause if they did we gon' be in some trouble, yea
If they did we gon' be in some trouble
Trouble, ohh-ohh-ohh-ohhh
