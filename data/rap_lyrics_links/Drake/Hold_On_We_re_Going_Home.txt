[Drake]
I got my eyes on you, you're everything that I see
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly
I can't get over you, you left your mark on me
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly

[Interlude: Drake]
Cause you're a good girl and you know it...
You act so different around me...
Cause you're a good girl and you know it...
I know exactly who you could be...

[Chorus: Drake]
Just hold on, we're going home...
Just hold on, we're going home...
It's hard to do these things alone...
Just hold on we're going home, ohh-ohh oh ohhhh..

[Drake]
I got my eyes on you, you're everything that I see...
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly...
I can't get over you, you left your mark on me...
I want your hot love and emotion endlessly...

[Interlude]

[Chorus: Drake] + (Majid Jordan)
So, just hold on we're going home (we're going home)
Just hold on we're going home (we're going home)
It's hard to do these things alone (things alone)
Just hold on we're going home (going home), ohh-ohh oh ohhhh (going home)

[Majid Jordan - repeat 2X]
You're the girl, you're the one
Gave you everything I loved
I think there's something... baby
I think there's something... baby

[Interlude] {*w/ Majid Jordan singing the last two lines*}

[Chorus: Drake] + (Majid Jordan)
Ohh, just hold on, we're going home (we're going home)
Just hold on, we're going home (we're going home)
It's hard to do these things alone (things alone)
Just hold on, we're go-ing home (going home), ohh-ohh oh ohhhh (going home)
