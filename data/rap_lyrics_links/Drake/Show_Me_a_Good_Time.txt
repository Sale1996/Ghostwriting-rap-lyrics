[Chorus: Drake]
How did I end up, right here, with you?
After all the things, that I, been through
It's been one of those days, we try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, let's get right
Now that I'm here baby
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good, show me a good
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah, aw yeah)

[Drake]
I live for the nights that I can't remember
with the people that I won't forget
Spendin all the money I just worked my ass off for 
doin things that I won't regret
I been waitin way too long, long, long, long
Tellin everybody that I know 
We about to be on, on, on, on
I ain't try and look like I lied to these niggaz
that I came up with, that's my team
Never would I let a woman come between
what we doin right now, this our dream
Wu-Tang Clan niggaz want that +CREAM+
I'm the Osirus of this shit right now
Go-to guy for the hits right now
Whatever you wanna drink girl pick right now
If you can't hold your liquor better quit right now, uh

[Chorus]

[Drake]
Yea, uhh
How 'bout you and all your morals and that outfit that you borrowed
Make the most out of tonight and worry 'bout it all tomorrow
Understand girl, we fam girl, can't get me right and not do Wayne
Cash Money, Young Money pop champagne, presidential suide girl, Barack Hussein
Tell me +Can We Kick It+ like Ali Shaheed and Phife Dawg?
People really hate when a backpack rapper get rich and start livin that life dawg
Feels like when you get into that paper hip-hop hates ya
They would do it just like I do, if they could it's in our nature - AH!
Young and rich and out of control, out in L.A. blowin clouds of the killer
I came up in the underground though, so I'ma spend another 10 thousand for Dilla
Call me overrated or created or too jaded
Because any way you put it bitch I made it, YUH!

[Chorus]

[Drake]
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good, show me a good
Show me a good time (aw, aw, aw yeah)
