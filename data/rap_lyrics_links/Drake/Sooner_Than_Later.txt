I forgot to call you on your birthday
You swear you're the last thing on my mind, yeah
There is nothing I could do to fix it
(All you ever asked me for was time, whoa)

[Chorus]
When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to
And I finally get a moment to myself 
I will realize you were everything I'm missing
And you tell me your in love with someone else
So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together
Make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever 
And I realized I waited too long but please don't move on

You don't need no one else [x5]

You just changed your hair and it looks perfect
Wish I was the first to let you know
Every chance I get to make it better
I just find away to let it go, whoa

[Chorus]

You don't need no one else [x5]

The girl or the world?
You see someone gotta lose
I thought that I can have it all
Do I really got to choose?
What good is all the cash
If it doesn't buy time
And what good is being famous
If I'm never on your mind

Nights fallen, lights glowing
And I'm just trying to pay the price owing
And I don't want to feel the comfort for my ice showing
And I ain't tryna be without you at the right moments
Nigga nice going
Is it worth it? That decision
Because hearts breaking and I ain't tryna be in that collision
So I'm a dust my shirt and fix my pants 
Cause I better look good girl if this my chance, I swear

So can you do me a favor?
If I pull it together
Make it sooner than later
We won't be here forever 
And I realized I waited too long but please don't move on

You don't need no one else [x5]
