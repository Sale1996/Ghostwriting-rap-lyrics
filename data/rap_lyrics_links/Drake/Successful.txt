[Intro - Trey Songz]
The money (money), the cars (cars)
The clothes (clothes), the hoes, I suppose...
yeah!

[Chorus - Trey Songz]
I want the money, money and the cars
Cars and the clothes, the hoes, I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

[Verse 1 - Drake]
Drizzy
Aw yeah, Trey I fuckin' feel ya
They be starin' at the money like it's unfamiliar
I get it, I live it, to me there's nothing realer
Just enough to solve your problems, too much'll kill ya
And when I leave I always come right back here
The young spitter that everybody in rap fear
Alot of ya'll are still sounding like last year
The game need change and I'm the motherfuckin' cashier
Nickels for my thoughts, dimes in my bed
Quarters of the kush shave the lines in my head
Take my verses too serious, you'll hate me
Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture, no HD
Yeah, I want it all, that's why I strive for it
Diss me, you'll never hear a reply for it
Any award show or party, I get fly for it
But I know that it's coming, I just hope that I'm alive for it


[Chorus - Trey Songz]
I want the money, money and the cars
Cars and the clothes, the hoes, I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

[Verse 2 - Drake]
Yeah, I want things to go my way
But as of late, alot of shit been going sideways
And my mother try to run away from home
But I left something in the car and so I caught her in the driveway
And she cried to me, so I cried too
And my stomach was soaking wet, she only 5'2"
And 48 hours all before I showed up
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poored up
Damn, my reality just set in
And even when the pantoms leased, them hoes wanna get in
I do alot of things hoping I never have to fit in
So try to keep up with my progress, it's like a dead-end
My girl love me, but fuck it my heart beats slow
And right now the tour bus is looking like a freak show
And life change for us every single week so
it's good, but I know this ain't the peak though cause I want the

[Chorus - Trey Songz]
I want the money, money and the cars
Cars and the clothes, the hoes, I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

[talking]
Alright well uh, aight
Why don't you put that fucking cigarrette out
....
Making it to the top, all the way to the top
You need to go for the money, and not the money you know what I'm saying
Hahahaha, you know what I'm saying?

[Verse 3 - Drake]
Uh, why is words from a decent man
Back when I was trying to put a ring on Alicia hand
This lost boy got fly without Peter Pan
And my delivery has got me buzzing like the Pizza Man
In-person I am everything and more
I'm everywhere these other niggas never been before
But inside I'm treading water, steady trying to swim to shore
I'm on a shopping spree to get whatever is in store
Yeah, just call me "Shopping Bag Drizzy"
Or call me "Mr. Damn, he ain't coppin' that, is he?"
And fans that he freshmen, it's about to get iffy
While this young'n that you doubted is about to get busy
I'ma kill it, I promise, that's how I know ya mad
I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads
The big homie, use a flash if you must
And I swear I ain't asking for much, all I want is the

[Chorus - Trey Songz] (Drake & Lil Wayne)
I want the money, money and the cars
Cars and the clothes, the hoes, I suppose
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful (D: yeah, that's all I want man)
I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful (W:you gotta tell 'em Trey)

I just wanna be, I just wanna be successful

[Drake talking]
Yeah, it's like I, it's like I know what I wanna say
I just don't know how to say it... to you

[Verse 4 - Lil Wayne]
Uh
Pardon the swag, but bitch it's Car-tey
Long bread, I don't eat shortcake, how come I can't
miss a woman like I can't miss court dates
Cheese, but she's not in this portrait
And yeah, life's fine, but I don't portray
I'm on the other side, but it is a short gate
I don't want the glow, I want the glo-ray
And I'ma fuck the world, but this is just foreplay
Tired of hearing bullshit, bring on the cow shit
Haven't met a smell that's stinkier then our shit
Haha, and that's word to Toronto
So high up, I got birds in the condo
Ha, ain't that a female dog
Ask her who I am to her, and she yell "God"
Weezy Baby, I go re-al hard
No further details boy
