Yeah... uhh
Word on road is the clique about to blow
You ain't gotta run and tell nobody, they already know
We've been livin on a high, they've been talkin on the low
But it's cool, know you heard it all before
That's why I asked you how you mean, how you mean
Thought you knew about the team, ay, yeah...
That's why I asked you how you mean, how you mean
Thought you knew about the team, ay, yeah, haha, uh

How you mean, how you mean, what you know about the team?
Man these niggaz need to stop it, they be crowdin up the scene
Baby girl you need to stop it, all that pride and self-esteem
got you angry 'bout this girl I'm with in all them magazines
Baby she look like a star, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
It look like we in love, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies
You know I could be ya knight in shinin Armor All tires
Tryin to tell you I'm the one, come and holla at me
'fore I'm on the next t'ing, YMCMB (ahh)

[Interlude: sample from Jon B's "Calling On You"]
Oohhhhh, finally got you right here (said I finally got my baby, yeah)
Tonight I'll ease your mind (tonight I'll ease yo' mind)
That's why I'm calling on you, ohhhhh (I'm calling on you)
And oooh, soft your love's desire (ooh soft your love)
It's hard to stay away (stay away yeahhh)
You keep me calling on you (oh-ho, you keep me calling)

[Chorus: Drake]
How you mean, how you mean
Thought you knew about the team, ay, yeah...
How you mean, how you mean
Thought you knew about the team, ay, yeah...

[Drake]
How you mean, how you mean, what you know about the team?
You just know what you get told, girl I see behind the scene
She spilled whiskey on her shirt, she gon' have to get it cleaned
She been goin way too hard, someone has to intervene
Baby she look like a star, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
It might look like I care, but only on camera
Only on camera, only on camera
Don't listen to the lies, I swear they all lies
You know I could be ya knight in shinin Armor All tires
Girl they love me like I'm Prince, like the new kid with the crown
Bunch of underground kings, thought you knew how we get down, huh?

[Interlude]

[Chorus]

[Outro]

Can't keep that shit
Hahaha
