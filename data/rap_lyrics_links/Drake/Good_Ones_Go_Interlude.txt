[Drake]
Oh yeah... oh yeah, oh yeah, oh
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh

Summer's mine
I swear I said it about a hundred times
I'ma need it back
Wishin you would come and find me
Just to tell me that I haven't changed
Girl I needed that from you
I'm gettin money just takin care of me girl
I'm spendin time just takin care of me right now
I'm gettin money just takin care of me girl
Cause you'll be tired of takin care of me by now

[Chorus: Drake] + (The Weeknd)
(Ooh-ohh, ooh-oh-whoa)
But the good ones go, the good ones go, if you wait too long
But the good ones go, the good ones go, if you wait too long
So you should go, you should go, before you stay too long

[Drake]
But don't you go gettin married, don't you go get engaged
I know you're getting older, don't have no time to waste
I shouldn't be much longer but you shouldn't have to wait
Can't lose you, can't help that I'm so sorry, I'm so selfish
Uh, uh, I been chillin in the city where the money's thrown high and the girls get down
In case you started to wonder why my new shit's soundin so H-Town
But when it's all done baby I'm yours if you're still around
And she knows, she knows, she knows

[Chorus]
