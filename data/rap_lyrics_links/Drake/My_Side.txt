[Intro: Drake]
Yeah, that's about it
This shit sound like, what bein rich feel like
For real, uhh
This life shit is, everywhere you can't control it
Too much goin on
Too much... too much, too much
Too much... too much, too much
You you you
Make me wanna take ya down through there
Make me wanna, take ya down through there
I'll take it there

[Drake]
Why you never come to where I stay at?
Always hidin out in your New York condo
Why you never come to where I stay at?
If anybody knows girl you know I know
Why are we wastin our relationship on a relationship?
Why are we rushin and forcin it? This isn't makin sense
Why are we focused on things that don't even mean nothin girl?
Why can we not find the time and sit down and discuss it girl?
Let me at least tell you my side of things, man
Aw, man... aw, man... aw, man

Yeah, me and you are playin house
Start thinkin that I'm losin touch
Got a tight grip on you now
Maybe I should loosen up
When I leave you and I go home
I start forgettin what it is
Start to think I gotta get it how I live
We too busy for a wedding or a kid
Yeah, if I'm workin then I know you workin
Keep in touch with other women cause you make me nervous
I empower girls that don't deserve it
I don't mean to do that shit on purpose
It's just that when I go home
I start forgettin what it is
The dream is over, I get lost up in the 6

And you don't ever come to where I stay at
You'd just rather stay up in your New York condo
You don't ever come to where I stay at
If anybody knows girl you know I know
Why are we wastin our relationship on a relationship?
You know how sticky these situations get
You go up higher than me some days
You know what I think we could be someday
Let me at least show you my side of things, man
Aw, man... aw, man... aw, man
