[Lykke Li]
Ooh, ooh, oooh
Ooh, ooh, oooh
Ooh, ooh, oooh...

Hands down...
I'm too proud, for love
But with eyes, shut...
It's you I'm thinkin of

[Drake]
But how we move from A to B, it can't be up to me
'Cause you don't know, who I was before you
And basically to see a change in me
I'd be losing, so I just ignore you, yeah...
Ohhh-ohh-ohhh
But you're on my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind
Ohhh-ohh-ohhh
But maybe in time, in time, in time, I'll tell you I'm a...

[Chorus: Drake]
A little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you
I guess that I'm a little bit, a little bit
A little bit in love with you
Ohh-ohh, oh

I know you told me break their hearts...
But it's you I wanna take apart...
And I will never ever be the first, to say it
But still I, they know I, I-I-I...

[Lykke Li]
I would do it, push a button
Pull a trigger, climb a mountain
Jump off a cliff, 'cause you know baby 
I love you, love you, a little bit
I would do it, you'd say it
You'd mean it, I would let you do it
It was you and I and not only, hah-HM...

[Chorus: Lykke Li]
I think I'm a little bit, little bit
A little bit in love with you
But only if you're a little bit
Little bit, little bit in la-la-la-la-love with me
Ooh-ho..

[Drake]
Ohh-ohh, oh
I hope they never find out...
What they already know, know... know
As soon as it's official..
We'll have to let it go, go... go
So we don't confirm the fling
Keep avoiding all the questions
You'll get teased with many things
I'm just scared to learn a lesson

The pressure's on
Both hearts beat like a metronome
Both +*NSYNC+ like a Justin song
Feels so right but it's just, so wrong
I wonder where my world 'bout
When niggas that I know tryna take my girl out
And her friends say I ain't the one to go for
She just jealous 'cause you always get approached more
Oh, well, tell her fall back 
Caught up in some mo' shit, tell her call back
Tell her get a man that ain't cheatin on her ass
Wit a girl that I know, yeah tell her all, that, that
And as for you, I think I know you're the one
The closest I've come, I'm probably a...

[Drake's Chorus]


[Lykke Li]
Ooh, ooh, oooh
Ooh, ooh, oooh
Ooh, ooh, oooh...
La-la-la-la-love with me, ooh-ho..

[Drake]
Ohh-ohh, oh...
Ohh-ohh, oh...
