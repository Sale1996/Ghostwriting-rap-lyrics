[Intro]
"You know, you know"
"You know, you know"

[Drake]
Ohh! Uhh, uhh, yeah
{"You know, you know"}

You know you know, how the story go
You done jocked my style, you done stole my flow
You done seen me out, you gets no hello
And you wonder why, man you know you know
Yeah, and you should let them boys know too
Show them niggaz every single thing I showed you
I'm here feelin like 50 back in '02
when e'rybody's sayin I'm the man, so true
Yeah, but what does it take to feel secure
A place with wooden floors, some space to put awards
A couple of parkin spots and maids to do the chores
The cars you always wanted and women that you adooooored
Well I got it, I got it
I wonder if I'll be happy without it, I doubt it
I try not to really think about it
I made it but I'm still playin like I'm bein scouted 'til I'm outed
Game time bitch, I hope you're proud of us
King James shit, watch me throw the powder up
This O.G. got my whole suite cloudin up
And I bet you I'll be out of time 'fore I'm out of luck
They ain't rootin for me, they ain't clappin for me
I'm only sayin could somebody just be happy for me?
I really hate to say "I told you so"
So I bite my tongue, but you know you know

[Chorus]
"You know, you know" {*3X*}
...
"You know, you know" {*3X*}
...
"You know, you know"

[Drake]
Uhh, please make your long story shorter
Cause time is of the essence for the king of first quarter
Numbers do the talkin, I have nothin for reporters
I just hope we make these flights and don't get held up at the border
Yeah, so you could spare me all the accolades
I'm the reason you could find my city on a atlas page
Half a million dollars later and my tax is paid
And I'm still spendin money from my actin days
Damn, life is such a lovely thing
Feel the perks that a seven-figure budget bring
Tell your girlfriend that I could pull some fuckin strings
So at courtside, will LeBron get a fuckin ring?
Yeah, I bet I'll be there, I'll be there
You see that '62 sittin outside, that's me there
I'm jumpin to the top, that's my leap year, prepare
Puttin in that overtime I never said it'd be fair
I'm always left wishin that I coulda done it in person
My apologies to all of the ones I was hurtin
I got new girls, but none of they love was for certain
And call old girls but none of they numbers are workin
Damn, what happened to us?
Life can always change, you have to adjust
How come when I got a party you stare at me in disgust?
They pay us just to have fun, you should see that as a plus
Especially when I come flyin through the door, and kindly ignore
the paparazzi outside tryin to record
Why has every women never dined here before?
Am I the only 23-year old wine connoisseur?
The Rothschilds, the Crus, the 'caias and the Opuses
It's always nice when you're out with someone that notices
My condo got that art gallery openness
I'm just really hopin that that isn't what your motive is
They ain't rootin for me, they ain't clappin for me
I'm only sayin could somebody just be happy for me?
I really hate to say "I told you so"
So I bite my tongue, but you know you know

[Chorus]
