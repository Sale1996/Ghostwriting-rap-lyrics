[Chorus: Rihanna]
I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost

[Drake: Verse 1]
I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still the feel the same
What's a life with no fun? please don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know
We know, they don't get you like I will
My only wish is I die real
Cause that truth hurts, and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinkin that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillow case
Big girls all get a little taste
Pushin me away so I give her space
Dealin with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thankin you, just don't know
Try to run from that, say you're done with that
On your face girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the parties over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry
You won't ever have to hide
And you seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes

[Rihanna]
Cause if you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you
I've loved and I've lost

[Drake: Verse 2]
It's my birthday, I get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you, but I lie if have to
Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do (you do)
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're followin your heart
Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know
We know, you hate being alone
When you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one
And you love your friends but somebody shoulda told you somethin' to save you
Instead they said...

(Don't tell me, I don't care, if you hurt)
(I don't tell you, you don't care, it feels good)
(Don't tell me, I don't care, if you hurt)
(I don't tell you, you don't care, it feels good)

[Chorus]
