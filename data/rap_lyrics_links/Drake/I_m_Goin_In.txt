[Verse One: Lil Wayne]
Hello motherfucker, hey hi, how ya doin
It's Weezy F. Baby come to take a shit and urine 
On the toilet bowl, bitches, pussy ass niggas
Stompin on This beat like a muh'fuckin Sigma
Bad to the brizzle, hat to da rizzle
I'm so official all I need is a whistle, 
Bitch named crystal, let her suck my pistol
She open up her mouth and then I blew her brains out
You ain't met a nigga like me and probably never will
Riders rollin wit me like eleven wheels
Find out where you livin, kill you in the kitchen 
The feds tryna clip us, but we ain't even trippin

[Chorus: Lil Wayne] 
I'm goin in, I'm goin in
I'm goin in, I'm goin in
(And I'm a go hard, and I'm a go hard)
(And I'm a go hard, and I'm a go hard)
Bitch, I'm goin in, I'm goin in
I'm goin in, I'm goin in
(And I'm a go hard, and I'm a go hard)
(And I'm a go hard, and I'm a go hard)

[Verse Two: Drake] 
First off you know what it is if you heard Drake 
Makin hoes wobble like a bridge in a earthquake
Never see me out cuz I live in my workplace
I give you the business, so button up your shirt straight
Look at where I landed, you would think I planned it
I'm just doin me and you can never understand it
Chicks get hammered, big dick bandit
Money flowin like a slit wrist, no bandage
Blowin purple clouds nigga, I'm so sky high
I ain't cuttin anybody slices outta my pie
Outta this world though, I'm so sci-fi
And I don't sit still I keep it movin like a drive by
I just tell the truth and so I'm good in every hood spot
21 years and I ain't ever met a good cop
Me and Wayne lean like Kareem doin hook shots
Cover me I'm goin in I'm buckin when the hook drops

[Chorus]

[Verse Three: Young Jeezy]
Hold up, wait one motherfuckin minute
It's the el capit√°n, I got motherfuckin lieutenant
I said I'm goin in, and I motherfuckin mean't it
I brought in the club and I'm a motherfuckin spend it
Cost a few hundred bands, and I motherfuckin mean't it
No need for a room, you know I'm fuckin it
She actin like she not, but she know she fuckin wit it
She said "I seen it all" I said "No you fuck didn't
You ever bust ten nuts in a two seater?"
She said "I can't feel my legs", I'm like "Bitch, me neither"
I'm goin in, where should I begin
I don't even know, maybe where my blunt ends
And I'm a be a legend, even when my life ends
And I'm a be a legend, even when this life ends
Girl I do my thang, hop up out it like, BAM
Bitch, I said I'm him, so I'm nothin like them
I'm goin in!

[Chorus]
