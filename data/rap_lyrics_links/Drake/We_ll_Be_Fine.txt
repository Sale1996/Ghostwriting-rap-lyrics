[Verse 1]
Yeah; never thoughts of suicide I'm too alive
But I still treat it like it's do or die
Even though dyin isn't in the plans
but neither was makin it and here I am
In the Presidential do you like your new room?
Always Presidential and tonight's no blue moon
Since I saw Aaliyah's precious life go too soon
She deserve the credit for how I'm about to get it
That's why I got a new dumb thing movin through the street
Got a new condo, movIN to the beach
Heard Nicki just bought a brand new crib
God damn man she's beauty and the beast - lord
Seems like yesterday that I was up and comin
Still so young that I ain't had enough of nothin
The fam here, the drink here
The girls here? Well fuck let's get it then

[Chorus]
Uhh, I'm tryin to let go of the past
Should we make this one a double? You ain't even gotta ask-ah
Because it's hard to say no, say no
Yeah it's hard to say no
Are you down, are you down? Yeah you all the way down, every time...
Am I down, am I down? Yeah I'm all the way down, we'll be fine...
Are you down, are you down? Yeah you all the way down, every time...
Am I down, am I down? Yeah I'm all the way down, we'll be fine...

[Drake]
Used to make us proud, we had dreams of gettin bigger mayne
Loved you until now, but now I'm the nigga mayne
You keep talkin that you was this and you had this
And you deserve some fucking credit how did anyone forget it
Got a show up in your city, yo girl is in the line
And the line around the corner, it's my muh'fuckin time
You should take it as a sign, man I got it right now
I wouldn't doubt it cause these bitches all about it right now
Let's be real about this shit, can I take you home?
Or come to where you stay? Do you live on your own?
I heard you got your ways, I never would have known
She said "You're such a dog," I said "Tou're such a bonnnnne"
I've been everywhere, where you know me from?
These days women give it to me like they owe me one
But they crave attention though they always sayin "show me some"
But girl you ain't the only one that's tryin to be the only one
At least I admit that, if you get that
And you with that, then fuck let's get it then

[Chorus]

[Outro: Birdman]
Yeah! Drizzy, yo' turn nigga!
Take care of the business nigga (shine on these niggaz)
Give these niggaz the business nigga!
Kill spray anything in the way, nigga
Fuck 'em, we don't love 'em (BRRAP~!)
Yeah, it's just that Uptown gangsta shit
Toronto stand up, for one of the realest niggaz
Drizzy, with the realest flow, y'know?
Toast to this gangsta shit (to this gangsta shit)
O.B.O., Y.M. C.M.B. (believe that!)
Yeah, you understand me?
Playing with these motherfuckin millions like they ain't nuttin
Throwin hundreds, rubber band stacks
That Y.M. C.M.B. shit nigga
Flashy lifestyle - one hundred
