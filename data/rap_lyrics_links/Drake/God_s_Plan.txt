[Intro: Drake]
They wishin and wishin and wishin and wishin
They wishin on me, yuh

[Drake]
I been movin calm, don't start no trouble with me
Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me
Don't pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me
You know how I like it when you lovin on me
I don't wanna die for them to miss me
Yes I see the things that they wishin on me
Hope I got some brothers that outlive me
They gon' tell the story, shit was different with me
God's plan, God's plan
I hold back, sometimes I won't (yuh)
I feel good, sometimes I don't (ay, don't)
I finessed down Weston Road (ay, 'nessed)
Might go down as G-O-D (yeah, wait)
I go hard on Southside G (yuh, wait)
I make sure that northside eat
And still

[Chorus: Drake]
... Bad things
It's a lot of bad things
that they wishin and wishin and wishin and wishin
They wishin on me
... Bad things
It's a lot of bad things
that they wishin and wishin and wishin and wishin
They wishin on me, yuh, ayy, ayy

[Drake]
She say, "Do you love me?" I tell her, "Only partly
I only love my bed and my momma, I'm sorry"
Fifty Dub, I even got it tatted on me
81, they'll bring the crashers to the party
And you know me
Turn the O2 into the O3
Dawg; without 40, Oli, there'd be no me
Imagine if I never met the broskies
God's plan, God's plan
I can't do this on my own (ay, no, ayy)
Someone watchin this shit close (yep, close)
I've been me since Scarlett Road (ay, road, ayy)
Might go down as G-O-D (yeah, wait)
I go hard on Southside G (ay, wait)
I make sure that northside eat (yeah)
And still

[Chorus: Drake]
... Bad things
It's a lot of bad things
that they wishin and wishin and wishin and wishin
They wishin on me, yeah, yeah
... Bad things
It's a lot of bad things
That they wishin and wishin and wishin and wishin
They wishin on me, yeah
