[Intro: Static Major]
Haha, haha
Yeah, ayyyyyy

[Chorus One: Drake] + (Static Major)
(After dark) In a whip so low
No one's gotta know
(After dark) Knockin at your door
I don't gotta work anymore
(After dark) You can
put your phone down, you're gonna need two hands
(After dark) You can't get enough
Girl you know I set it up, for after dark
(Girl you know I set it up, for after dark)

[Drake]
Late night, like Left Eye, I'm +Creepin+
Assumin the worst cause I haven't, heard from you, all weekend
Your silence is drivin me up the wall, up the wall
I cannot tell if you're ducking calls, or missing calls
Cause, you've been so patient
I drink on the job and, smoke on the job
So, I don't know how serious you take it
Can't offer much more, you've heard it before
That narrative for me isn't changin
I wanna make you a priority
I wanna let you know there's more to me
I wanna have your faith restored in me
I'll be on my way

[Chorus Two: Drake] + (Static Major) + {Ty Dolla $ign}
(After dark) In a whip so low
No one's gotta know {No one's gotta know}
(After dark) Knockin at your door {Knockin at your door}
I don't gotta work anymore {I don't gotta work no more}
(After dark) You can {Ooh yeah}
put your phone down, you're gonna need two hands {Ooooh yeah}
(After dark) You can't get enough
Girl you know I set it up, for after dark
(Girl you know I set it up, for after dark)

[Ty Dolla $ign]
Late night me and you, got you wet like the pool
Then I'm tryna dive in; put some time in, yeah
Get the vibe right, get your mind right
It's gon' be a long night (ooh yeah)
Put yo' feet in this water, don't wanna get yo' hair wet
We've hooked up a couple times, we ain't took it there yet
You broke up with your man and ain't been with nobody else
You like "Fuck these niggaz," rather keep it to yourself
He did you wrong, he left you down bad
Now you can't trust nobody
You said "Do anything, but just don't lie to me"
I said I'd ride for you girl, you said you ride for me
Ummm, pulled up to the show then we got ghost
And when it's after dark anything goes

[Chorus Two]
