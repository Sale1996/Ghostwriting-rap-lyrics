Look, she got a saying theres no alice without the tin man<end_line>
Crib was 2 mil, plus I just bought a couch for ten grand<end_line>
Even if the house was ten grand<end_line>
And there was no pool<end_line>
Would I still be witout my swim fan?<end_line>
The ceiling could be higher<end_line>
She making requests<end_line>
Don't know if she feeling me or she be feelin what I buy her<end_line>
And purses are light now<end_line>
She use em all the time<end_line>
So she smilin to the the point that it hurt when she bite down<end_line>
And she simply a new model<end_line>
Stay spendin dollars<end_line>
But she got less sense than a empty perfume bottle<end_line>
At times she a solid chick<end_line>
And I'm a sucka for the cuties<end_line>
So she always lookin good when my wallets thick<end_line>
Chillin on the linen, she all up in the closet so much<end_line>
Got a hunch thats shes feelin other women<end_line>
Want the diamonds on the face in the center<end_line>
Nice guys finish last so I'm winnin every race that I enter and she a<end_line>
<verse_end>

Video girl<end_line>
To the fullest extent<end_line>

Video girl<end_line>
And you betrayed your wealth<end_line>
Got a feelin you shoulda stayed yourself<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
You're all the same<end_line>
Look at vida guerrera<end_line>
Theres no need to compare her<end_line>
I bet she smiles cuz she loves what she sees in the mirror<end_line>
I bet shes out meetin directors instead<end_line>
And frustratrated cuz shes already been addressed in they head<end_line>
Be a teacher, open up shop if you can do nails fine<end_line>
Apply for a business loan and I'll bet you that they'll sign<end_line>
If you a real dime<end_line>
poppin as if its your only option<end_line>
Girl theres things to do<end_line>
Other than jail time<end_line>
Look this ain't a song dissing half of these rappers<end_line>
Or pasha and sasha, esther baxter<end_line>
Melyssa ford, or katy or anyone after<end_line>
I just give my opinion for laughter<end_line>
Or maybe to think on<end_line>
So next time you out at the club<end_line>
And a brother offers the whole table something to drink on<end_line>
You just take in effect he got a stack with a mink on<end_line>
Now he got you doing everything that you think wrong<end_line>
Look, you tell your parents that its cash at an easy pace<end_line>
Ya dad screaming take ya ass outta jeezy face<end_line>
And as ya man I wont back down first<end_line>
But they got you doing soft-core background work<end_line>
That messed up like an officer that pulls you over<end_line>
And he ask questions later and pat down first<end_line>
But you ain't thandie newton, and this ain't crash here<end_line>
The resolutions passed baby, this ain't last year<end_line>
Look, I got a message, I'll say it<end_line>
I got some beats still<end_line>
Regina hall and garcelle and alice neal<end_line>
Young girls these here women with big dreams<end_line>
Role models that you can watch on the big screen<end_line>
If you refuse to change and you that chick still<end_line>
Respect yourself, don't be convinced that these tricks will<end_line>
You got an audience believe it or not<end_line>
My cousin who can't speak know the lyrics to tip drill<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
And I ain't trying ta generalize every video girl, you n'a mean?<end_line>
Say that ya all one way man its just that sometimes man you gotta<end_line>
Accept the fact that theres times that you gotta better yourself<end_line>
You know as a person man. I love to see my black women strong, single<end_line>
Independent. doing they thing without popping they booty in some rappers<end_line>
Video you n'a mean? its a wonderful thing baby. so uh, don't hate me for<end_line>
This one ladies. just take my advice you n'a mean? cuz its like uh<end_line>
If she beautiful and honey dances<end_line>
