I'm nervous round my boys, it depends on their anguish<end_line>
Depends on if they saving all the tops on pepsi<end_line>
With dreams of seeing girls topless on jet skis<end_line>
Depends on what they do to achieve that<end_line>
Robbing r&b singers, 'specially if they know where the keys at<end_line>
