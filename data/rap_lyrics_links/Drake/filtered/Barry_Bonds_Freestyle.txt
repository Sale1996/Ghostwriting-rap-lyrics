And if we talking cards I will fold him with the poker<end_line>
You and your whole crew are like a deck a 54<end_line>
So it's obvious ya'll be steady rollin with some jokers<end_line>
And me? I'm rolling with some brokers<end_line>
Like damn. can you niggahs get any broker?<end_line>
I got my new girl so content<end_line>
Just save yourself the ebarresement, don't even aproch her<end_line>
Disguise your self, go buy a costume<end_line>
I am making stock works, while you working stock rooms<end_line>
and I was praying I would drop june,<end_line>
But label reps applying preasure to make them pop tunes<end_line>
So I keep it rocking for pet sakes<end_line>
You fake gangsta rappers a clecha<end_line>
And if you ain't talking dough when you meet drake<end_line>
I'll be in your face,<end_line>
Like "no speak a la engliash"<end_line>
Soon as you hear it you quote it<end_line>
They try to be the one that I done left out the show with<end_line>
But trust me I'm aware, and my cars right there<end_line>
Is this interior enough for ya'll material motives<end_line>
Cause if you like it ya'll shud stick with me<end_line>
My money good, I ain't neva had to flip a key<end_line>
Alotta ice, alotta cream like dickey d<end_line>
Might cut the phone and disapear like mishy me<end_line>
But I'mma try and have you on the trip with me<end_line>

A couple subliminal lines caught me in the mix<end_line>
I guess he thought he could of been gotti in the flix<end_line>
But at this point I'm just pocking a body with a stick<end_line>
Now a days rapping is a childrens hobby<end_line>
And grils keep telling me I'm still this snobby<end_line>
I tell them myself who I am feeling probably<end_line>
Just because I gotta buzz like a building lobby<end_line>
It ain't a song that your ass finna skipp<end_line>
I try'd to sell weed, give me cash for this zip<end_line>
The way your girlfriend pump me up in the car<end_line>
Seem like she don't really need no gas for the trip<end_line>
Millionare shades, fade with the waves<end_line>
I smurk at a niggah if he still rocking braids<end_line>
That just let's me know that we ain't on the same page<end_line>
And that goes out to every niggah except trey...<end_line>

Unless you betcha that's expencive cause it's not a?<end_line>
Spittin a crock pot of bottemless gravy<end_line>
The shit is so nasty, how is it tasty?<end_line>
And you can probably find him walking out of a Macy's<end_line>
Forget it girl, they just thinking how to replace me<end_line>
Exit with a joke, leave these niggahs some hope<end_line>
You put the yay beat and put that shit in a joke<end_line>
Well... I'm thinking I should leave out on this note<end_line>
Niggah keep your two cents I ain't trynna leave you broke<end_line>
Life of a don, lights keep gloown<end_line>
Come up in the club with that fresh shit on<end_line>
Something crazy on my arm...<end_line>
