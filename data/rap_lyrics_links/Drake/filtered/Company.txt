<verse_start>
I got some shit for you to come and get<end_line>
I'm at the St. Regis up on Briar Oaks, hit me when you done your shift<end_line>
I see you doin' well, baby<end_line>
Oh you pullin' shit together, I can tell, baby<end_line>
Is you single or what?<end_line>
I need a girl from the country<end_line>
I need a girl from Kentucky<end_line>
I need a shawty from Houston<end_line>
I need a girl who gon' love me<end_line>
I need a girl who gon' trust me<end_line>
Someone to fuck me<end_line>
Someone to make me feel lucky<end_line>
Someone that's so proud to be with me<end_line>
She walk right up to her ex, look him dead in the face<end_line>
And say, "You ain't got the juice like that<end_line>
You ain't got the juice like that"<end_line>
That's cold, ice cold, girl you ain't have to do him like that<end_line>
Why you had to do him like that?<end_line>
Gotta come through quick, quick<end_line>
Oh you at the club? Cashin' out with everything<end_line>
Hit me when you done your shift<end_line>
I know a girl I should propose to, but we just on some different shit<end_line>
She on some up at 9AM already cookin' in the kitchen shit<end_line>
And lately we've been fightin' on some, "why-you-love-the-strippin-shit"<end_line>
Yeah, she workin' with the spatula, I know she love flippin' shit<end_line>
All, on me<end_line>
I don't deserve it<end_line>
She's just a little too perfect<end_line>
She's just a little too worth it<end_line>
I don't deserve her at all, no not at all<end_line>
I only text her, man I never call<end_line>
I'm still a canine at heart, I'm a dog<end_line>
