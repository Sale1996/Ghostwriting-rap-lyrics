Yeah, uhh...<end_line>
Round, I got a hundred girls in each phone<end_line>
Drizzy Drake mayne, "Young Sweet Jones"<end_line>
I never cheat unless you count the girls I cheat on<end_line>
I know you can't bring every single one you meet home<end_line>
Homesick just when I thought I was sick of home<end_line>
Losin track of time, every day we switchin zones<end_line>
Drizzy Hendrix, I'm just backstage gettin stoned<end_line>
"Thank Me Later" man, a million copies shipped and gone<end_line>
Overboard nigga, I'm quoted more nigga<end_line>
Results are in, I guess you should've voted more nigga<end_line>
Swimmin in the money, I'll just float ashore nigga<end_line>
Never drownin, what the fuck you think this boat is for nigga?<end_line>
Yeah, I'm quick to take an R&B diva out<end_line>
I'll bring some friends, she bring some friends that know what we about<end_line>
And when it's done I'll put my slippers on and see 'em out<end_line>
And tip the driver to make sure he take the scenic route<end_line>
I swear these women livin like they tryin to write a book after<end_line>
But I'm just really tryin keep it G for my chapter<end_line>
Listen to my words, see just what I mean<end_line>
Rest in peace to Chad Butler, every day I'm +Ridin' Clean+<end_line>
