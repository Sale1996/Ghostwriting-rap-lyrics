Why you over there lookin at me?<end_line>
Why your man stand-in right beside ya?<end_line>
The temporary happiness he might provide ya<end_line>

Tryna say you like asight<end_line>
I know that I feel a bit slowly, IÂ’m kinda like,<end_line>
"I'on't really wanna hit this girl"<end_line>
and so she want this chef stick like Napoleon Dynamite<end_line>
Well, I'ma give it to you, honeybunches<end_line>
You feel it all under ya ribs like some tummy crunches<end_line>
All my other girls all up on that subtle shit<end_line>
They don't wanna cut it, they wanna wrap it and cuddle with<end_line>
Consequences keep weighin me down<end_line>
So whenever she thinks I'm serious, I'm playin around<end_line>
It gets deeper and cold-ER, the funny thing is<end_line>
I'm writin this in my head and she asleep on my shoulder like...<end_line>
