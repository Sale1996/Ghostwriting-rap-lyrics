<verse_start>
Yeah, oh you gotta love it<end_line>
Oh you got, oh you gotta love it<end_line>
I heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it<end_line>
I told 1da send me something and I got it covered<end_line>
Somehow always rise above it<end_line>
Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover?<end_line>
The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive<end_line>
Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor<end_line>
Every shot you see them take at me? They all contested<end_line>
Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question<end_line>
Last night I went to sleep, wanted more<end_line>
Tried to decide what direction I should go towards<end_line>
Some nights I wish I could go back in life<end_line>
Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice<end_line>
28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me<end_line>
Longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me<end_line>
Prolly forever if I stay in my zone<end_line>
I speak on this generation but can't change it alone<end_line>
I heard a lil lil homie talking reckless in Vibe<end_line>
Quite a platform you chose, you shoulda kept it inside<end_line>
Oh you tried, it's so childish calling my name on the world stage<end_line>
You need to act your age and not your girl's age<end_line>
It gets worse by the annual my career's like a how to manual<end_line>
So I guess it's understandable man<end_line>
Oh you gotta love it, you gotta love it cheer<end_line>
I know rappers that call Paparazzi to come and get 'em<end_line>
To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention<end_line>
I remember when it used to be music that did it<end_line>
But then again times have changed man, who are we kiddin'?<end_line>
I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with<end_line>
I'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with<end_line>
If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin'<end_line>
We prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on<end_line>
But here we are, yeah<end_line>
Lately I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence<end_line>
They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments<end_line>
Bitches alter my message like we have words<end_line>
And stories bout my life hit the net like a bad serve<end_line>
Bitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing crazy this year<end_line>
Fuckin' with my image<end_line>
I've been tryna reach to you so I can save 'em this year<end_line>
Fuck it I guess I gotta wait til next year<end_line>
And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot<end_line>
Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block<end_line>
Nobody lookin' out for nobody<end_line>
Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody<end_line>
Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news<end_line>
So everybody can tweet about it<end_line>
And then they start to RIP about it<end_line>
And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it<end_line>
Damn, I just had to say my piece about it<end_line>
Oh you gotta love it<end_line>
But they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public<end_line>
That's a hotter subject<end_line>
I've been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget<end_line>
I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins<end_line>
Shout out to Ashley, Biama, Julia, Ericka, Southern America<end_line>
Part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance, part in my hair again<end_line>
That's that comeback flow, comeback flow<end_line>
Once I start it's apparent<end_line>
I wanted a girl whose ass is so big that's partly embarrassin'<end_line>
But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions<end_line>
And fuck all the judgement<end_line>
Your content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you?<end_line>
Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too<end_line>
I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas<end_line>
Bein' number two is just being the first to lose<end_line>
My city dictated music, nobody seein' us<end_line>
Winter here already but somehow I'm heatin' up<end_line>
Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough<end_line>
Let's drop a tape on these niggas then we'll see what's up<end_line>
Yea, boy you rappin' like you seen it all<end_line>
You rappin' like the throne should be the three of ya'll<end_line>
"Best I Ever Had" seems like a decade ago<end_line>
Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go<end_line>
Oh please, take at ease, where's the love and the peace<end_line>
Why you rappin' like you come from the streets?<end_line>
I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees<end_line>
And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves<end_line>
Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease<end_line>
I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese<end_line>
Special order for anybody that's comin' for me<end_line>
Shit you probably flinch if somebody sneeze<end_line>
You see they got me back like it's just 40, Oli, and me<end_line>
Cuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free<end_line>
I'm almost at four minutes going off on the beat<end_line>
Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats<end_line>
Man, oh you gotta love it<end_line>
And on top of that it's getting harder to eat<end_line>
Rappers downgrading houses<end_line>
Putting cars on the lease<end_line>
To think labels said they had a problem marketing me<end_line>
And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe<end_line>
Oh you gotta love it<end_line>
And head to toe I'm Prada covered<end_line>
I know your girl well, just not in public<end_line>
Blame the city, I'm a product of it<end_line>
Young nigga from the city<end_line>
You gotta love it<end_line>
