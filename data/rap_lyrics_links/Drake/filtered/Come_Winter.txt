I met this new girl late june or early july<end_line>
I called her a bunch of times but she barely replied<end_line>
Now it's december, I'm driving, and she's like where's my hi?<end_line>
I swear, that I never called you cause I really get shy<end_line>
See that was a segue, I believe the matter<end_line>
Is what happens after the seaon where the leaves just scatter<end_line>
Where the timb laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up<end_line>
Drugs dealers standin and they parka hoods slip up<end_line>
Where girls become exes from summer's caught ho'in<end_line>
The winter cars come out, the summer cars go in<end_line>
And some places is breezy, and some it start snow-ing<end_line>
And if you planning family vacations you better know when<end_line>
But some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city<end_line>
Instead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity<end_line>
Cause mom stays up late, she seen them videos<end_line>
Where cancun college students pouring water on their titties!<end_line>

Forget to mention, this girl that never gets to the beach<end_line>
She lives just west of my street, and so we destined to meet<end_line>
Since I'm driving, I ask her how to get the suite<end_line>
She doesn't answer, opens the door and just gets in the seat<end_line>
She throws her bag in the back, and starts adjusting the heat<end_line>
She's bold but I roll with it, I'm impressed cause she's sweet<end_line>
Then she says "I heard your song and I'm obsessed with the beat<end_line>
I mean, the lyrics are good, but I'm obsessed with the beat<end_line>
I love it when voyce sings and the chorus is good<end_line>
There's a couple things in the song that I suggest you repeat"<end_line>
Off this I'm kinda takin it back for a second<end_line>
I get her number she tells me to call her after this session<end_line>
And so I do, and it's kind of awkward, the surface hard to scratch<end_line>
until we end up sexin and now my heart attached<end_line>
I'm thinkin off I should've been more southern<end_line>
And realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin and ho!<end_line>

And now, I'm proud to have her like montreal to the frizzench<end_line>
She love to play hurt like carter did on the bizzench<end_line>
But, my boy say I'm actin different, because I lay downtown<end_line>
And I still I rush to pick her up from work and fizzench<end_line>
She tellin everyone imma hold here down<end_line>
Tell everyone I'm the prince up in this cold clear town<end_line>
And stupid me I just listen to her,<end_line>
Instead of wondering if this is really gon' last me the whole year round<end_line>
But then spring shows up, and it's dallas in this bitch<end_line>
The weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed<end_line>
When we were together it seeming like way back when<end_line>
Ball players hop on the plane and make it way back in<end_line>
See she used to play piana, and now she never wait for santa<end_line>
Instead of saving for marriage, she saving for carrabanna<end_line>
And it's a shame, she had me convinced that she could've been a dime<end_line>
I guess, I lost another one to the wintertime<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I miss you, most of aaaallll, myy daarling<end_line>
strolling in the park<end_line>
And watching winter turn to spriing<end_line>
Strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spriing<end_line>
<verse_end>
