People around you should really have nothing to say<end_line>
Me, I'm just proud of the fact that you've done it your way<end_line>
And the weekend's here, started it right, even if you only get part of it right<end_line>
Live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight, party tonight<end_line>
Dyin to meet your girlfriends that you said you might bring<end_line>
If they're the ones that tell you that you do the right thing<end_line>

Houston girls love the way it goes down<end_line>
Atlanta girls love the way it goes down<end_line>
Vegas girls love the way it goes down<end_line>
But I gotta say, oh baby, oh baby, why is this so familiar?<end_line>
Just met her, already, feel like I know the real her<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
They keep tellin me don't save you<end_line>
If I ignore all that advice, then somethin isn't right<end_line>
Then who will I complain to?<end_line>
But the weekend's here, started it right, even if I only get part of it right<end_line>
Live for today, plan for tomorrow, party tonight, party tonight<end_line>
You got your guards up, I do too, there's things we might discover<end_line>
Cause you got a past and I do too, we're perfect for each other<end_line>
