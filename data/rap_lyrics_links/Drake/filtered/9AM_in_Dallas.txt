These are my one St. Thomas flows; me, my niggaz and some Madonna hoes<end_line>
They look just like +Virgins+ but trust they down to go<end_line>
Yeah, discussin life and all our common goals<end_line>
Smart kids that smoke weed, honor roll<end_line>
Look how the champagne diamonds glow<end_line>
Fine dinin, pour another glass when the wine is low<end_line>
I'm in the crib stackin money from here to the ceilin<end_line>
Whatever it is I got it's clearly appealin<end_line>
These other rappers gettin at inferior feelin<end_line>
I hope you feel it in your soul, spiritual healin<end_line>
Take a look at yourself, the mirror's revealin<end_line>
If ya ain't got it, ya ain't got it, the theory is brilliant<end_line>
People ask how music is goin, I heard it pays<end_line>
I just came off makin 2 million in thirty days<end_line>
Damn, I guess it does what the message was<end_line>
Sometimes I feel I be spendin my money just because<end_line>
With Weezy I'm just out here reppin us<end_line>
'til I get to shake the hand of the man that's blessin us<end_line>
Yeah, I know these niggaz miss the mean lyrics<end_line>
Kush got the room smellin like teen spirit<end_line>
I'd ask kindly if no one out here would bring their feet up<end_line>
Until I lose for now I'm the game's single leader<end_line>
I fly private so no one tells me to bring my seat up<end_line>
And book a suite where me and your favorite singer meet up<end_line>
Who ya like? Tell me who it is<end_line>
I'ma make sure that that woman is the next one on my list<end_line>
I should call it a night but fuck it I can't resist<end_line>
This one is for all the niggaz from my city tryin to diss<end_line>
Without a response from me you really fail to exist<end_line>
And I love to see you fail, that feelin there is the shit<end_line>
I swear, ahh, pussy nigga get your bread up<end_line>
Enjoy the seat that the stewardess just forced yo' ass to let up<end_line>
Why yo' scary ass lookin down? Pick ya head up<end_line>
No one told you your disguise is the most ridiculous get-up<end_line>
With nose plugs in now I can smell a setup<end_line>
So you just wastin your time, you only makin me better<end_line>
Yeah, I try to tell 'em don't judge me because you heard stuff<end_line>
Chase N. Cashe, that's my brother from the Surf Club<end_line>
Damn, that nigga always kept it so hood<end_line>
Back when we would smoke good at the oak woods<end_line>
And have girls fall through like coins in a couch<end_line>
Now we just fuckin all the bitches they warned us about<end_line>
Scared for the first time, everything has clicked<end_line>
What if I don't really do the numbers they predict?<end_line>
Considerin the fact that I'm the one that they just picked<end_line>
to write a chapter in history, this shit has got me sick<end_line>
But if I really do it don't expect to get a split<end_line>
Cause this truly is some shit I don't expect for y'all to get<end_line>
I'm nervous but I'ma kill it cause they 'bout to let the realest team in<end_line>
Throwin up in the huddle nigga, Willie Beamen<end_line>
We're still throwin touchdown passes<end_line>
In tortoise frame glasses hopin that someone catch it<end_line>
People say, "That old Drake, we started to miss it"<end_line>
But they need to be a little more specific<end_line>
Man is this what y'all want? In my best Chris Tucker impression<end_line>
Duckin your questions, fuck your suggestions<end_line>
Money gets all of my love and affection<end_line>
Cars all black like the cover of Essence<end_line>
I'm allergic to comin in second<end_line>
But I never sneeze, Y.M.O.E. nigga yeah<end_line>
