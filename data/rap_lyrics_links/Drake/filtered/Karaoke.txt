Things have been so crazy and hectic<end_line>
I should've gotten back by now<end_line>
But you know how much I wanted to make it<end_line>
It's probably better anyhow<end_line>
So if you gotta go<end_line>
If there's anything I should know<end_line>
If the spotlight makes you nervous<end_line>
If you're looking for a purpose<end_line>
You put the tea in the kettle and light<end_line>
Put your hand on the metal and feel it<end_line>
But do you even feel it anymore<end_line>
I remember when you thought I was joking<end_line>
Now I'm off singing karaoke<end_line>
Further than I've ever been<end_line>
So if you gotta go<end_line>
If there's any way I can help<end_line>

Isn't it ironic that the girl I want to marry is a wedding planner<end_line>
And tells me my life is too much and then moves to Atlanta<end_line>
Damn, of all the places you could go<end_line>
I just thought you'd choose somewhere that had somebody that you know<end_line>
I'm always up too late, I worry bout you there alone<end_line>
In that place you call your home, warm nights and cold Patron<end_line>
I hope that you don't get known for nothin' crazy<end_line>
Cuz no man ever wants to hear those stories bout his lady<end_line>
I know they say the first love is the sweetest<end_line>
But that first cut is the deepest<end_line>
I tried to keep us together, you were busy keeping secrets<end_line>
Secrets you were telling everybody but me<end_line>
Don't be fooled by the money<end_line>
I'm still just young and unlucky<end_line>
I'm surprised you couldn't tell<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
But the spotlight makes you nervous<end_line>
