I should be downtown, whipping on the way to you<end_line>
You got something that belongs to me<end_line>
Your body language says it all<end_line>
Despite the things you said to me<end_line>
Who is it that's got you all gassed up?<end_line>
Changing your opinion on me<end_line>
I was only gone for the last few months<end_line>
But you don't have the time to wait on me<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I try with you<end_line>
There's more to life than sleeping in<end_line>
And getting high with you<end_line>
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do<end_line>
And that just didn't sit right with you<end_line>
And now you're trying to make me feel a way, on purpose<end_line>
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose<end_line>
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose<end_line>
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way<end_line>
I've stopped listening to things you say<end_line>
Cause you don't mean it anyway, yeah<end_line>
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way<end_line>
Maybe we should have just did things my way<end_line>
Instead of the other way<end_line>
<verse_end>

I tried with you<end_line>

<verse_start>
Yeah, yeah, yeah<end_line>
Yeah, yeah, yeah<end_line>
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way<end_line>

Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way<end_line>
