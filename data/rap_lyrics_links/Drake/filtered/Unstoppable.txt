<verse_start>
My name is Drizzy<end_line>
And I ain't perfect<end_line>
But I work hard<end_line>
So I deserve it<end_line>
And I belong<end_line>
Right where you see me<end_line>
Ain't on the fence about it, I ain't mister fenny<end_line>
I got a descent set of manners<end_line>
And a job that fills up any empty schedule or planner<end_line>
And I fall in love with girls<end_line>
Caught up in superficial glammer<end_line>
Who dress like Sara Jessica<end_line>
And live like Princess Diana<end_line>
So often they have addictions<end_line>
And I'm the one that will feed it<end_line>
But truly you bad enough<end_line>
That you don't even really need it<end_line>
You could show at the party<end_line>
On dirty public transit<end_line>
And I guarantee the cameraman will still be snapping candids<end_line>
Of you and your possie partying<end_line>
Drinking what you get handed<end_line>
With your virgin island tans<end_line>
All looking like you just landed<end_line>
I don't really understand it<end_line>
I'm not sure I'm comprehending<end_line>
But these girls are having fun with whoevers money they spending screaming<end_line>
<verse_end>
