I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive<end_line>
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance<end_line>
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping<end_line>
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different<end_line>
Started realizing a couple places I can take it<end_line>
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement<end_line>
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation<end_line>
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience<end_line>
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking a lack of patience<end_line>
Just me and my old man getting back to basics<end_line>
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted<end_line>
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing<end_line>
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas<end_line>
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us<end_line>
We even talked about you and our couple of moments<end_line>
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups<end_line>
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone<end_line>
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own<end_line>
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is<end_line>
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?<end_line>
Y'all don't even know what you want from love anymore<end_line>
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored<end_line>
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?<end_line>
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, hah?<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Thinkin' about Texas back when Porsche used to work at Treasures<end_line>
Or further back then that, before I had the Houston leverage<end_line>
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit<end_line>
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it<end_line>
Cause that night I played her three songs<end_line>
Then we talked about something we disagreed on<end_line>
Then she started telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz<end_line>
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off<end_line>
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in a galleria<end_line>
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria<end_line>
Landmarks to the 'muses that inspired the music<end_line>
When I could tell it was sincere without trying to prove it<end_line>
The one that I needed was Kourtney from Hooters on P Street<end_line>
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me<end_line>
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?<end_line>
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isnt<end_line>
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz<end_line>
Girl I thought we had it all planned out, guess I fucked up the vision<end_line>
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions<end_line>
When you find out how Im living I just hope Im forgiven<end_line>
It seems like you dont want this love anymore<end_line>
Im acting out in the open its hard for you to ignore<end_line>
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?<end_line>
Who you settling for, who better for you than the boy, huh?<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Cause I love me, I love me enough for the both of us<end_line>
That's why you trust me, I know you been through more than most of us<end_line>
So what are you? what are you, what are you so afraid of?<end_line>
Darling you, you give but you cannot take love<end_line>
