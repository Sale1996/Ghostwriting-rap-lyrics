Listen, seeing you got ritualistic<end_line>
Cleansin' my soul of addiction for now<end_line>
'Cause I'm fallin' apart, yeah<end_line>
Tension between us just like picket fences<end_line>
You got issues that I won't mention for now<end_line>
'Cause we're fallin' apart<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Passionate from miles away<end_line>
Passive with the things you say<end_line>
Passin' up on my old ways<end_line>
I can't blame you, no, no<end_line>
Passionate from miles away<end_line>
Passive with the things you say<end_line>
Passin' up on my old ways<end_line>
I can't blame you, no, no<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Listen, hard at buildin' trust from a distance<end_line>
I think we should rule out commitment for now<end_line>
'Cause we're fallin' apart<end_line>
Leavin', you're just doing that to get even<end_line>
Don't pick up the pieces, just leave it for now<end_line>
They keep fallin' apart<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Passionate from miles away<end_line>
Passive with the things you say<end_line>
Passin' up on my old ways<end_line>
I can't blame you, no, no<end_line>
Passionate from miles away<end_line>
Passive with the things you say<end_line>
Passin' up on my old ways<end_line>
I can't blame you, no, no<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Trying to think of the right thing to say<end_line>
