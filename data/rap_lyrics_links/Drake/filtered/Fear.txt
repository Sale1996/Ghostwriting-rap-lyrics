Look, uhh, this is me, still the same<end_line>
They want the hits, I play the game<end_line>
No auto-tune, but you can feel the pain<end_line>
It all comes spillin' out like I hit a vein<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I never cried when 'Pac died<end_line>
But I probably will when Hov does<end_line>
And if my tears hold value<end_line>
Then I would drop one for every single thing he showed us<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Look, fuck all y'all, we ignore feelings here<end_line>
Premature millionaires, welcome to my realest year<end_line>
Yeah, I swear that we makin' a killin' here<end_line>
I should be on top of the world here just chillin' here<end_line>
<verse_end>
