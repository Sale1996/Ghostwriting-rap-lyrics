<verse_start>
I done walked in here<end_line>
Lookin' like the mothafuckin' man of the year<end_line>
Think I had the mothafuckin' plan of the year<end_line>
Which was simply to make groupie fans of my peers<end_line>
And I get my girl whatever she desire<end_line>
And my niggas get whatever they require<end_line>
These rappers old, I'm the reason they expire<end_line>
Plus I got a city that I Carey like Mariah<end_line>
That punch line was predictable<end_line>
I still got you shittin' bricks, homie, quit the bull<end_line>
And we don't need new members<end_line>
To me the clique is full<end_line>
And I be getting' the same women that tip the pool<end_line>
Believe or not<end_line>
I receive a lot<end_line>
So, I be wearing the same Gucci that Jeezy got<end_line>
And I be buyin' the Louie that Kanyizzy cop<end_line>
And I be rippin' the same reords that Weezy rock<end_line>
This shit is east pot<end_line>
That's why I'm ready, man<end_line>
I'd never copy Norbit like eddie, man<end_line>
Did you get it? Eddie Murphy was in Norbit<end_line>
Or was it way over your head?<end_line>
Did you forfeit?<end_line>
Yeah, I take a woman shopping in a store quick<end_line>
Her ass big, she just tryin' to make a four fit<end_line>
Yeah, they need ot issue out a recall<end_line>
I'm goin' up and they headin' into a freefall<end_line>
The fundamental are needed, you playin' street<end_line>
And I was out at BET, but I didn't see ya'll<end_line>
These skee-low rappers wishing they could be tall<end_line>
Lettin' all their fake friends use them like a free stall<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I said I know you see me chillin'<end_line>
Super low key<end_line>
If I'm with the right niggas, you can scoop a O.Z.<end_line>
All the hustlers and the bouncers<end_line>
And the groupies know me<end_line>
Fresh denim, fresh shades<end_line>
In a group with no kids<end_line>
It start up when I touch the door<end_line>
And I encourage ladies to touch the floor<end_line>
As soon as we finish cuttin', we can cut some more<end_line>
Then after you get high, make 'em, get 'em, girl you finna get low<end_line>
Lights dimmed down<end_line>
Got alota dough<end_line>
Plus a hit sound<end_line>
What you mean you ain't heard?<end_line>
I come highly recommended<end_line>
Everybody my friend, even if they been offended<end_line>
They ain't really got a choice, it's an obvious decision<end_line>
You tryna make a come up in my city, it's a given<end_line>
Plus a nigga famous<end_line>
Plus I got a vision<end_line>
Not to mention havin' bars like a mothafuckin' prison<end_line>
They takin' too long<end_line>
Their records on hold<end_line>
They threatened by my presence<end_line>
'Cause I make them feel old<end_line>
Guaranteed if they drop, they braggin' 'bout what they sold<end_line>
Just remember where I lived at, 50, 000's goin' gold<end_line>
Holla at me when you see me, make yourself known<end_line>
'Stead of hatin' on my music in the comfort of your home<end_line>
Nigga, be a man<end_line>
You actin' like a bitch<end_line>
I ain't actin' like I'm rude<end_line>
I'm just actin' like I'm rich, rich<end_line>
Yeah, uh!<end_line>
Ridin' with Weezy Fuckin' Baby<end_line>
Are you the type of girl that me and Weezy fuckin', baby?<end_line>
'Cause I don't waste time, can't yo see a nigga lazy?<end_line>
And I might need some help<end_line>
But, you know, Weezy's fuckin' crazy<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I done walked in here<end_line>
Lookin' like the mothafuckin' man of the year<end_line>
My shades so dark<end_line>
And my ice so bright<end_line>
My buddies and my fans wanna fight your right...<end_line>
<verse_end>
