<verse_start>
Check, look<end_line>
And I ain't tryna get to know nobody but you<end_line>
Do me a favor tell me what's happenin'<end_line>
I am drinkin' XO D is sippin' some Appleton<end_line>
Usually the things I desire I always apprehend<end_line>
Back again return of the mack again<end_line>
'Deceiving' was cool I'll never record the track again<end_line>
Even though my ex is fuckin' one of my rapper friends<end_line>
I don't wanna seem like I am always attacking them verbally<end_line>
You can stop frontin' I know you heard of me<end_line>
Babygirl ya, ya, ya heard of me<end_line>
Little me<end_line>
Pay attention I guarantee you it'll be<end_line>
One of the best, decisions you've made<end_line>
I'm sonnin'/sunnin' them all I live in the shade<end_line>
Previously mischievous behaviour was the leader of me<end_line>
You could say I was fresh to some conceited degree<end_line>
Steppin' out the house tryna figure out where cameras from Cheaters would be<end_line>
But now I need a culprit<end_line>
I am talkin Long Sands Beach, condo adult shit<end_line>
I am talkin' all day shoppin' sprees in the mall with<end_line>
Friends that I ball with<end_line>
Hear me Trey's girl go and get you some Fall shit<end_line>
Sweetie I am a track's demise<end_line>
I will kill this song 'til it actually dies<end_line>
With a military jacket and some packed supplies<end_line>
I won't say I'm the best 'til the stats arrive<end_line>
And all these a-list parties you fraternize<end_line>
Where you can't wear hats inside it's only slacks and ties<end_line>
Bu you don't never act surprised<end_line>
You just hold it down for your boy 'til the plaques arrive<end_line>
And girl, I used to blow a couple thousand at the shake joint<end_line>
Now it cost a couple thousand for a Drake joint<end_line>
I gave up a lot to make a progress<end_line>
I give it to you, and you take it the best<end_line>
