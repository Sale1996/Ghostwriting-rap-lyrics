Breathe through, ride through, damn girl<end_line>
Oh man I don't know<end_line>
Pilled up filled up damn girl<end_line>
I'll be getting back to you for sure, man man<end_line>
Laced up dripped up sauced up<end_line>
Damn girl I wanna ride with you<end_line>
Waved up blowing up blowing up growing up<end_line>
Had to get it popping with you<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
What if I pick you up from your house<end_line>
We should get out<end_line>
We haven't talked in a while<end_line>
We should roll to see where it goes<end_line>
I saw potential in you from the go<end_line>
You know that I did<end_line>
I don't know if you know but I know who you are<end_line>
You could be big as Madonna<end_line>
Just get in the car and let's touch the road<end_line>
Don't make other plans<end_line>
Say you get up early, you work for the man<end_line>
Well he'll understand<end_line>
Pull up I'm pulling up on you in ten<end_line>
Already on ten<end_line>
Big as Madonna I'll say it again<end_line>
Soon as you get in nah nah nah<end_line>
