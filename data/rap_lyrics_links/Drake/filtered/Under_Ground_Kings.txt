<verse_start>
Yea... bridge over troubled water, ice in my muddy water<end_line>
Rich off a mixtape, got rich off a mixtape<end_line>
Probably shouldn't be drivin, it just got so much harder<end_line>
Can't even see straight, I can't even see straight<end_line>
Ohh, fuck with me, I'll buy the shots<end_line>
Live a little, cause niggaz die a lot<end_line>
And lie a lot but I'm the truth, that's right I fuckin said it<end_line>
The livin proof that you ain't gotta die to get to heaven<end_line>
You girl, you right there, you look like you like this shit<end_line>
How'd I know? How'd I know? That's me on some psychic shit<end_line>
I could tell a lie if you askin me my whereabouts<end_line>
But I might talk that real if you ask me what I care about<end_line>
Rap and bitches, rappin bitches, bitches and rappin<end_line>
Rappin and bitches until all of it switches - I swear<end_line>
It's been two years since somebody asked me who I was<end_line>
I'm the greatest man, I said that before I knew I was<end_line>
That's what's important what really happened before this<end_line>
when me and my crew was all about this rapper from New Orleans<end_line>
singin "Walkin like a man, finger on the trigger<end_line>
I got money in my pocket, I'm a uptown nigga, ah~!"<end_line>
With fame on my mind, my girl on my nerves<end_line>
I was pushin myself to get somethin that I deserve<end_line>
That was back in the days, Acura days<end_line>
I was a cold dude, I'm gettin back to my WAYS<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Sometimes I need that romance, sometimes I need that pole dance<end_line>
Sometimes I need that stripper that's gon' tell me that she don't dance<end_line>
And tell me lies, make it sound good, make it sound good<end_line>
Do me like the women from my town would<end_line>
Leather with that woodgrain, Persian rugs on wood floors<end_line>
Talkin all them good things, that's all I'm really good for<end_line>
Memphis, Tennessee know, see I start to go deep back<end_line>
And Ridge Crest with my seat back with Yo Gotti and E-Mack<end_line>
And these niggaz got them diamonds glowin in they mouth<end_line>
And they rockin furs like it's snowin in the South<end_line>
And every pretty girl tell me that's the shit that she like<end_line>
So why am I in class if this is who I'm tryin to be like?<end_line>
So I drop out, lessons I was taught are quick to fade<end_line>
Soon as I realize that turnin papers in won't get me paid<end_line>
And if I don't do nothin I'ma ball<end_line>
I'm countin all day like a clock on the wall<end_line>
Yeah I need that; makin major changes to the life I'm livin<end_line>
I had no choice, I had to prove I made the right decision<end_line>
That was back in the days, Acura days<end_line>
I was a cold dude, I'm gettin back to my WAYS<end_line>
<verse_end>
