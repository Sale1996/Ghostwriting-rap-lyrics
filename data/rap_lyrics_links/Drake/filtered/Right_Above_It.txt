And uhhh, my real friends never hearin from me<end_line>
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me<end_line>
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused<end_line>
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews<end_line>
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes<end_line>
Live in the same buildin, but we got different views<end_line>
I got a couple cars, I never get to use<end_line>
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos<end_line>
And these days all the girls is down to roll<end_line>
I hit the strip club and all them bitches find a pole<end_line>
Plus I been sippin so this shit is movin kinda slow<end_line>
