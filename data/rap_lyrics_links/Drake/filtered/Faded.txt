D-d-d-d-damn what did I consume<end_line>
Somethin spinnin fast either me or it's the room<end_line>
I bet you it's the room cause I don't do no drugs<end_line>
Or maybe it's that Â‘tron cause I sure do have a buzz<end_line>
Baby either way I'm throwed and I am on a mission<end_line>
So if ya ears a virgin id advise you not to listen<end_line>
Cause this shit isn't couchere and this shit isn't christian<end_line>
It's that muthafuckin heat you can find up in kitchen<end_line>
Girl holla at yo nigga I got that shit for low<end_line>
Ok maybe I don't but guarantee someone I know<end_line>
Wait let me slow it downI'm gettin ahead<end_line>
Plus it's gettin hot so I'm a take a seat instead<end_line>
I'm lucky I ain't deadI'm on a rollercoaster ride ya'll<end_line>
We all of age and I ain't got nothin to hide ya'll<end_line>
And in this game I'm a tidal when the tides small<end_line>
So drop me in and I release just like a time bomb<end_line>
