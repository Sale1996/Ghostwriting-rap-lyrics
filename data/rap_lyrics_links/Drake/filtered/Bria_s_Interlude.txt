<verse_start>
Cause when I'm all alone<end_line>
I think about your face<end_line>
And how I wanna touch<end_line>
I'm so far away<end_line>
All I wanna do is give you all of me now<end_line>
Are you ready? Are you ready? Yeah<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I'm aware that we just met<end_line>
I don't wanna leave you yet<end_line>
Promise that I won't forget<end_line>
I'm comin' back, I'm comin' back<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
About to board a flight<end_line>
Sittin' at my gate<end_line>
I just wanna touch you<end_line>
But I'm so far away<end_line>
All I wanna do is give you all of me now<end_line>
Are you ready? Are you ready? Oooh<end_line>
<verse_end>
