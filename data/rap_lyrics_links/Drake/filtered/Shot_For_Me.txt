I can see it in your eyes - you're angry<end_line>
Regret ain't got shit on what you're feelin now<end_line>
Mad cause he ain't like me<end_line>
Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me<end_line>
All the care I would take, all the love that we made<end_line>
Now you're tryin to find somebody to replace what I gave to you<end_line>
It's a shame you didn't keep it<end_line>
Alicia, Katia, I know that you gon' hear this<end_line>
I'm the man, yeah I said it<end_line>
Bitch I'm the man~! Don't you forget it<end_line>
The way you walk, that's me<end_line>
The way you talk, that's me<end_line>
The way you've got your hair up - did you forget that's me?<end_line>
And the voice in your speaker right now - that's me that's me<end_line>
And the voice in your mirror, that's me<end_line>
Can't you see that I made it? Yeah I made it<end_line>
First I made you who you are, and then I made it<end_line>
And you're wasted, with your ladies<end_line>
Yeah I'm the reason why you always gettin faded<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Ok look - I'm honest, girl I can't lie, I miss you<end_line>
You and the music were the only things that I commit to<end_line>
I never cheated for the record back when I was with you<end_line>
But you believe in everything but me girl, I don't get you<end_line>
She says I know you changed, I never see you<end_line>
Cause you're always busy doin thangs<end_line>
I really wish had a different way of viewin thangs<end_line>
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things<end_line>
It's such a small place not much to do but talk and listen<end_line>
The men are jealous and the women all in competition<end_line>
And now your friends tellin you stories that you often misinterpret<end_line>
And taint all your images of yo' "Mr. Perfect"<end_line>
I could tell that you been cryin all night, drinkin all summer<end_line>
Prayin for your happiness, hope that you recover<end_line>
Uhh, this is one I know you hated when you heard it<end_line>
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it<end_line>
