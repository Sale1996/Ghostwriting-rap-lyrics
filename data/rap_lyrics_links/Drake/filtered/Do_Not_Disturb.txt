Yeah, stylin' though<end_line>
Dissin', but got pictures with me smilin' though<end_line>
All the things you need, you still want problems though<end_line>

All the love I need is at the rodeo<end_line>
All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah<end_line>
All the girls I know are there with Ian Throw<end_line>
Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old?<end_line>

Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome<end_line>
I need 40, 000 people to see what I'm on<end_line>
Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves<end_line>
I was an angry youth when I was writin' Views<end_line>
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew<end_line>
I'll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do<end_line>
Steady doin' double shifts<end_line>

More blessings because I'm generous<end_line>
Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us<end_line>
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet<end_line>
She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it<end_line>
Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it<end_line>
Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it<end_line>
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night<end_line>
Wakin' up to public statements about my private life<end_line>
I can never sleep 'til morning on all my quiet nights<end_line>
But you can rest assure that my mind is right<end_line>
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days<end_line>
Never stick around to see shit change<end_line>
Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin'<end_line>

Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense<end_line>
Especially people that want to lecture me<end_line>
and frame it like they just want the best for me<end_line>
Or they check for me, whatever splits it up<end_line>
So there's more for them and there's less for me<end_line>
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me<end_line>
No one's done it successfully<end_line>
7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me<end_line>
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery<end_line>
Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me<end_line>
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency<end_line>
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally<end_line>
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly<end_line>
If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me<end_line>

I want to make sure they learn from me<end_line>
I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety<end_line>
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency<end_line>
My life is set around competition and currency<end_line>
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery<end_line>
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me<end_line>

More Life<end_line>
