I forgot about you last night<end_line>
For the first time in a long time I did, ohhh<end_line>
I was caught up in these drinks they keep on making<end_line>
An amazing conversation<end_line>
with this girl named Lorraine, who says she's from L.A.<end_line>
And keeps makin me laugh and even asks if she can pay<end_line>
Ohhhhhh, she could be good for me<end_line>
Ohhh, that's when you text me<end_line>
Tell me that you miss me, I forget about Lorraine<end_line>
And the fact she's right here with me<end_line>
She's starin in my face, somethin had to change<end_line>
Thought that all these feelings went away<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I hate getting, messages from you, from you<end_line>
It's like you know the perfect shit to say<end_line>
Fucks up my whole day<end_line>
I thought that all these feelings went away<end_line>
I hate getting, messages from you, from you<end_line>
Especially when you say you should've stayed<end_line>
Fucks up my whole day<end_line>
I thought that all these feelings went away<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Ooh, I hate the shit you do<end_line>
I hate the shit you do, I hate the shit you do<end_line>
I hate the shit you do, I hate the shit you do<end_line>
But I still text you back, say I miss you too<end_line>
<verse_end>
