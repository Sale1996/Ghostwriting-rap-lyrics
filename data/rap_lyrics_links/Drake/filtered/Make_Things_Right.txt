<verse_start>
I'm from the city where people be gettin lazy<end_line>
Litterin in the streets<end_line>
And the club district is poppin like literally every week<end_line>
And promoters'll push flyers<end_line>
Money exchange hands<end_line>
Liars sell you they dreams<end_line>
And dummies exchange plans<end_line>
Hustlers give you events<end_line>
Bouncers give you pass<end_line>
Directors give em a shot<end_line>
So girls'll give up the ass<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
And groupies that would flock to hometown athletes<end_line>
And start rolling together like snoopy and woodstock<end_line>
Daffy and bugs, its all laughing and hugs<end_line>
Til the dude catch a plane<end_line>
And she back where she was<end_line>
Right back on the bus<end_line>
Its ashame cuz now at his rental<end_line>
She throwin bricks like shaq in the clutch<end_line>
You can see thats shes colder<end_line>
Cuz he doesnt hold her<end_line>
Fall flat on the ground trying ta lean on his shoulder<end_line>
know that he tried ta told her<end_line>
That he couldnt mold her<end_line>
If this the type of chick you wanna be when you older, I say<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Now up north theres five artists deservin a listen<end_line>
And I'm one of em, the other four you know who you are<end_line>
But if you gotta think through<end_line>
Chances are that it ain't you<end_line>
I singlehandedly carry out what you can't do<end_line>
And see I take a couple of breathers<end_line>
And then things come together on the spot like a couple thats eager<end_line>
If you wanna pack a duffel and leave her<end_line>
Go ahead, I couldnt give two damns like a couple of beavers<end_line>
But uh, the in & the out<end_line>
Whenever I'm out in memphis the man seen as trill<end_line>
And every verse the man seem to kill<end_line>
You can find him with black jays and socks like I'm andreena mill<end_line>
Japan and brazil, the audience acreaming<end_line>
And then you come around and all the fans seems to chill<end_line>
Advances to deals, financing appeals<end_line>
The hustles, I have you feeling like you dancing in heels and uh<end_line>
<verse_end>
