<verse_start>
In this world of desperate housewives and freakin players<end_line>
rappers they tend to be smilin<end_line>
because they swimmin in women<end_line>
most of em sick of favors<end_line>
They come in secret flavors<end_line>
Thats why I envy omar<end_line>
because so far I'm no where close to malik and deja<end_line>
And thats some higher learning<end_line>
Trying to excel with the brake on<end_line>
I'll have you stuck in the same spot<end_line>
With the tires burnin<end_line>
And I'm a liar turnin 19, jaded with no faith<end_line>
In any female thats askin what I was earnin<end_line>
I met this recent lady<end_line>
She knew a piece of sadey by spinners<end_line>
I guess in my southern eyes that she decent maybe<end_line>
Well second thought if we have it then she can keep the baby<end_line>
Cause she ain't give me the butterflies that aleshia gave me<end_line>
Its like I'm using some bread to sop up some decent gravy<end_line>
now I'm out of both and I've been thinkin of aleshia lately<end_line>
I'm all alone, I got a feelin its on<end_line>
Cause nowadays most of the thrill of chillin is gone and uh<end_line>
<verse_end>

Some dudes they turn purple with hurt faces<end_line>
Circling workplaces<end_line>
And following girls on the assumptions of what the worst case is<end_line>
They get to first bases<end_line>
Then they get to retreating cause if she cheatin<end_line>
he wanna know what the first trace is<end_line>
now you like macgyver<end_line>
Cause you sneakin around<end_line>
And she don't know that you there when you standin right beside her<end_line>
I can't relate to that<end_line>
I had to take it back a couple a years<end_line>
When some of the best kicked it with Drake in fact<end_line>
I bet that they knew it cause in my mind I play through it with<end_line>
And in the end I listen but I don't see me as they do<end_line>
Cause its my opinion, my life, my potentials for my wife<end_line>
And I used to be eager to buy em the world<end_line>
maybe I'm confused about what I desire from girls<end_line>
either way I'm all alone, got a feelin its on<end_line>
Cause nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin is gone and uh<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
And nowadays some girls are the type of person that<end_line>
Will tell they friends that they use him which is confusin<end_line>
Since I ain't made them a purchase yet<end_line>
but theres logic behind it<end_line>
emotions double and they try to cover up<end_line>
Like a mansion with the projects behind it<end_line>
I tend to freak with this<end_line>
I get a girl and pretend that I love the spendin<end_line>
And all she gave was a decent kiss<end_line>
Thinkin she been spoiled<end_line>
but golddiggin is nothing when you can shovel for days<end_line>
And come up with tin foil<end_line>
We could dissect it see<end_line>
you take a dominique or another freak in the sheets<end_line>
And you picture that she just slept with me for nothing<end_line>
gave her nothing<end_line>
her reputations in jeopardy<end_line>
Cause it ain't take her 3 of that shopping to get her next to me<end_line>
Collectively I look for a proper chick that'll rep for me<end_line>
Instead of seeing something she wants and callin and textin me<end_line>
For thinkin that exists, I got a feeling I'm wrong<end_line>
nowadays most of the thrill of just chillin is gone and uh<end_line>
<verse_end>

Loves lost<end_line>
Loves gone<end_line>
Love lost<end_line>
Love is gone<end_line>
