Days in the sun<end_line>
And nights in the rain<end_line>
Summer is over, simple and plain<end_line>
Found me some fun that's good for the pain<end_line>
Already told you, I don't feel the same<end_line>
I don't feel the same<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Anywhere I go<end_line>
I can't help but show<end_line>
I don't feel the same<end_line>
Anywhere I go<end_line>
I can't help but know<end_line>
I don't feel the same<end_line>
Anywhere I go<end_line>
I can't help but know<end_line>
<verse_end>
