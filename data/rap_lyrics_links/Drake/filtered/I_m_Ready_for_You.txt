R.I.P. to the girl you used to see<end_line>
Her days are over, baby she's over<end_line>
I've decided to give you all of me<end_line>
Baby come closer, baby come closer<end_line>
I'm ready for ya<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Kill 'em all, switch it up<end_line>
Put it on, zip it up<end_line>
Let my perfume, soakin in your sweater<end_line>
Say you'll be here soon, sooner the better<end_line>
No options for her, you sayin no<end_line>
I run this game, just play your role<end_line>
Follow my lead, what you waitin fo'?<end_line>
Thought it over and decided tonight is the night<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Nothin on, I strut around<end_line>
I do it big, I shut it down<end_line>
I wonder if you'll be able to handle me<end_line>
Mental pictures, no cameras please<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Uhh, red lipstick on the wine glass, cameras in my mind flash<end_line>
Black lingerie, white diamonds, what a contrast<end_line>
I know you get impatient as the time pass<end_line>
You say you wanted fast? Define fast<end_line>
Cause I could speed it up and make it last<end_line>
And I could audition for this and I could be part of the cast<end_line>
And I could produce for your future, I could co-direct your past<end_line>
And make damn sure that you never forget it, committed<end_line>
I'm ready, I'm wit it, still here like a statue<end_line>
Pink champagne, green ink in your tattoos<end_line>
You say you got baggage, well I'm packed too<end_line>
Plus I got a sex pistol pointed right at you<end_line>
Bang! The baddest woman ever in the heart of South<end_line>
Proven over and over again, that's why I'm hard to doubt<end_line>
Plus I'm Young Money 'til the death, I took the Carter route<end_line>
I'm more than ready too, hope it's somethin that you thought about<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
R.I.P. to the girl you used to see<end_line>
Her days are over, baby she's over<end_line>

I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya<end_line>
I-I-I-I-oh-oh-oh, I-I, I'm ready for ya<end_line>
I-oh-oh-oh, so keep thinkin you're the man<end_line>
Cause it's all part of my plan, I-I, I'm ready for ya<end_line>
<verse_end>
