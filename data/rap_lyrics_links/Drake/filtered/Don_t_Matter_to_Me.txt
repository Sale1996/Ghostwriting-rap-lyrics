Ay, wild things you're doin at night<end_line>
Trips to wherever feels right<end_line>
Doin it all just to feel things<end_line>
Drinking's enough of a vice<end_line>
Drugs just aren't suiting you right<end_line>
You were just fine as the real thing, thing<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
You, you, you know<end_line>
That's not the way to get over me<end_line>
I don't know what you're sayin<end_line>
You, you, you know<end_line>
That's not the way to get over me<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I can't, recover from our last conversation<end_line>
You called me weak<end_line>
And you tested my manhood as we yelled at each other<end_line>
You wanted me to go and put my hands on you just to show you I love you<end_line>
You know I can't, jeopardize both our reputations<end_line>
Despite what you say<end_line>
Despite what you choose to do with yourself this summer<end_line>
You're actin out, you know you love to see me down stressin over somethin<end_line>
You, you<end_line>
<verse_end>
