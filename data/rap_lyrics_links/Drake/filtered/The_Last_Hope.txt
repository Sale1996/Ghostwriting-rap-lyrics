<verse_start>
Jealousy's suttin I haven't felt for years<end_line>
There's nobody around for me to be jealous of<end_line>
I bet you do a show in my city and no one cheers<end_line>
Even if you make the music that ladies and fellas love and dove<end_line>
I'm incredible fuckin' unforgettable<end_line>
And when it comes to records <end_line>
I will eat it if it's edible<end_line>
They say the futures always foreseen<end_line>
That's why I'm steady getting more money, more cream<end_line>
My flow is stuck in the moment that comes before dreams<end_line>
I stay avoiding unlucky like 14<end_line>
And people get behind 'im and they fight for 'im <end_line>
'Cause he wont let no other niggas write for 'im<end_line>
And even when it's quite warm<end_line>
The attitude coursing through the veins of my city is a ice storm<end_line>
The name Drake and I don't take it for granted<end_line>
I just take it you offended 'cause I'm taking advantage mayne<end_line>
