<verse_start>
The girl or the world?<end_line>
You see someone gotta lose<end_line>
I thought that I can have it all<end_line>
Do I really got to choose?<end_line>
What good is all the cash<end_line>
If it doesn't buy time<end_line>
And what good is being famous<end_line>
If I'm never on your mind<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Nights fallen, lights glowing<end_line>
And I'm just trying to pay the price owing<end_line>
And I don't want to feel the comfort for my ice showing<end_line>
And I ain't tryna be without you at the right moments<end_line>
Nigga nice going<end_line>
Is it worth it? That decision<end_line>
Because hearts breaking and I ain't tryna be in that collision<end_line>
So I'm a dust my shirt and fix my pants <end_line>
Cause I better look good girl if this my chance, I swear<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
So can you do me a favor?<end_line>
If I pull it together<end_line>
Make it sooner than later<end_line>
We won't be here forever <end_line>
And I realized I waited too long but please don't move on<end_line>
<verse_end>
