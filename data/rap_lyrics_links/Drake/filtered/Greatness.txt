<verse_start>
Uhh... I am a distraction<end_line>
Comin for my spot and I don't signal as I back in<end_line>
If cash is beautiful then money is attraction<end_line>
Now I should be a muh'fuckin centerfold in Maxim<end_line>
Open to my page and admire my desire<end_line>
Huh, frequent flyer I aspire to retire<end_line>
My voice stands alone even if I'm with a choir<end_line>
Got a +Cannon+ on my hip and nigga this is not Mariah<end_line>
Naw, this the record killer for hire<end_line>
I sleep and eat with a weapon, the beat is all I require<end_line>
Look what I created despite the niggaz that hated<end_line>
Every single bar gettin first forty-eighted<end_line>
In a state of euphoria, feelin so sedated<end_line>
Then me and bitch the same, we feelin so related<end_line>
Forest Hill estated, all Dennis Caded<end_line>
I put a thousand on it I could probably fuck the waitress<end_line>
So, wait just take this<end_line>
One line at a time, make sure it makes sense<end_line>
White cup, orange pop, Tennessee state shit<end_line>
Drop a fo' in it and appreciate the greatness<end_line>
Nigga, ha ha...<end_line>

<verse_start>
I wrote this verse sittin in my new car<end_line>
Sometimes where you headed is too far, it's more about where you are<end_line>
And I am, everywhere that you wish you could be<end_line>
Somebody somewhere just really understood me<end_line>
Yeah, I dream big, no false hope<end_line>
My other niggaz move ki's, no off-notes<end_line>
But understand rich is how we're all endin up<end_line>
I'm at the label in the elevator, send him UP!<end_line>
