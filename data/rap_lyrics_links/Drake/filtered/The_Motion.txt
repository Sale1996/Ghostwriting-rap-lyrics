<verse_start>
It's not me and you<end_line>
It's not me. It's you<end_line>
You're reckless and you know it<end_line>
They don't love you like I do<end_line>
Say you're moving on, well, I guess that's just the motion<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I don't have a fuck to give<end_line>
I been moving state to state<end_line>
In my leather and my Tims<end_line>
Like it's 1998<end_line>
And my dog Chubby Chubb<end_line>
That's my nigga from the way<end_line>
On the East side of the city<end_line>
That's where everybody stay<end_line>
Seem like everybody calling<end_line>
'Cause they want me on their song<end_line>
It's like every time I touch it<end_line>
I can never do no wrong<end_line>
When they need a favor from ya man they don't leave you alone<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Looking back on it at least my pride is in tact<end_line>
'Cause we said no strings attached<end_line>
And I still got tied up in that<end_line>
Every thing that I write is either for her or about her<end_line>
So I'm with her even when I'm here without her<end_line>
And she know it<end_line>
The girl that I want to save is like a danger to my health<end_line>
Try being with somebody that want to be somebody else<end_line>
I always thought she was perfect when she was being herself<end_line>
Don't even know how to help<end_line>
<verse_end>
