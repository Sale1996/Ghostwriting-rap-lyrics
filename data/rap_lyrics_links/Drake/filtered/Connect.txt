Isn't it amazing how you talk all this shit and we still lack communication<end_line>
How beautiful our kids will be, girl, I don't need convincing<end_line>
How every conversation starts with this time will be different<end_line>
Oh the ideas funny, oh the ideas funny<end_line>
Oh the idea is so fun every time<end_line>
At least we try for homerun every time<end_line>

She just wanna run around the city and make memories<end_line>
That she can barely remember<end_line>
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power<end_line>
She just wanna run over my feelin's<end_line>
Like she drinkin' and drivin' in an 18 wheeler<end_line>
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power<end_line>
She used to say "You can be whoever you want, even yourself"<end_line>
Yeah, I show up knowin' exactly who I was and never leave as myself<end_line>
But when it falls apart, I'm always still down<end_line>
To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground<end_line>
Cause you would learn to love people and use things<end_line>
And not the other way around<end_line>

I remember when my schedule was as flexible as she is<end_line>
She call and tell me be here before the sun up<end_line>
I be dressed before we hung up<end_line>
I take Eglinton to 401 east<end_line>
And exit at Markham road and the East end<end_line>
Where all the pretty girls are sleeping<end_line>
My license been expired I renew it after the weekend<end_line>
Fuck I know I said that shit the last 7 weekends<end_line>
Girl I guess procrastination is my weakness<end_line>
I hate stoppin' for gas this late<end_line>
Cause this nigga's creepin and I like how we're creepin'<end_line>
Summer is comin' know you could feel it<end_line>
20 on pump whatever I ain't got enough to fill it<end_line>
Won't knock on your door<end_line>
My uncle say, "You drive my whip like it's yours"<end_line>
I got the pedal to the floor<end_line>
I'm on my motherfuckin' way swangin'<end_line>
