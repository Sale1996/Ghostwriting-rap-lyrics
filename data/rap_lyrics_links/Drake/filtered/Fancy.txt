You gettin ready so I know we gon' be here a while<end_line>
In the bathroom, flat irons and nail files<end_line>
Spendin hours in salons on your hairstyle<end_line>
And in the mall, steady rackin up the air miles<end_line>
Hit the gym, step on the scale, stare at the number<end_line>
You say you droppin ten pounds preparin for summer<end_line>
And you don't do it for the man, men never notice<end_line>
You just do it for yourself, you the fuckin coldest<end_line>
Intelligent too, ooh you're my sweetheart<end_line>
I've always liked my women book and street smart<end_line>
Long as they got a little class like half days<end_line>
And the confidence to overlook my past ways<end_line>
Time heals all, and heels hurt to walk in<end_line>
But they go with the clutch that you carry your lip gloss in<end_line>
And look, I really think nobody does it better<end_line>
I love the way that you put it together, uh<end_line>

Uhh, 5-and-a-half in boys, ass is off the hook<end_line>
Cinderella 'bout to lose the glass off her foot<end_line>
And when I find it, is when I find you<end_line>
And we can do the things we never got the time to<end_line>
Better late than never, but never late is better<end_line>
They tell me time is money, well we'll spend it together<end_line>
I'm down for whatever, you just lead the way<end_line>
We go to dinner you don't even look at me to pay<end_line>
Mature women with more than me were the first to tempt me<end_line>
And Jason had this girl Tammy with a purple Bentley<end_line>
How she got it I ain't never get to ask<end_line>
I just knew that she was fine like a ticket on the dash<end_line>
Yeah, but shoutout to the homeowners<end_line>
The girls that got diplomas and enough money to loan us<end_line>
a little somethin extra, should we ever need it<end_line>
If it sounds like you then let me hear you repeat it<end_line>
