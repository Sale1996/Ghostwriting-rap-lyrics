On some DMX shit<end_line>
I group DM my exes<end_line>
I told 'em they belong to me, that goes on for forever<end_line>
And I think we just get closer when we're not together<end_line>
You tell me that I'm confusin'<end_line>
More immature than Marques Houston<end_line>
Cuts too deep for a band-aid solution<end_line>
We too deep in this thing to never lose me<end_line>
LOLOL I'm glad you find this shit amusin'<end_line>
Heard a lot about me 'fore we started off<end_line>
I know you heard that my pool parties like Mardi Gras<end_line>
I know you heard that my girl is sponsored by Audemars<end_line>
That's why she's always correctin' me when my time is off<end_line>
And my house is the definition<end_line>
Of alcohol and weed addiction<end_line>
You got a different vision<end_line>
You wanna walk around naked in the kitchen<end_line>
Without runnin' into one of my niggas<end_line>
That's not the way we livin'<end_line>
Too much goin' on, it's just not realistic<end_line>
These days I don't talk 'bout them days like I miss 'em<end_line>
And you shouldn't miss 'em either, we different people<end_line>
But every time we speakin'<end_line>

I wanna know how much time you spent on them paragraphs<end_line>
Where you're getting me<end_line>
All that grey in our conversation history, you<end_line>
Playin' mind games, when you sayin' things<end_line>
Playin' mind games, we both doin' the same thing<end_line>
Slide on a late night<end_line>
You like to slide on a late night<end_line>
You send the "are you here?" text without an invite<end_line>
That's that shit that I don't like<end_line>
We both slide on a late night<end_line>
Do things in our off time<end_line>
We both, yeah<end_line>
Made some mistakes, pon road<end_line>
Yeah, how's that for real?<end_line>
You toyin' with it like Happy Meal<end_line>

Remember you was livin' at the London for a month<end_line>
Service elevator up to 4201<end_line>
We was still a secret, couldn't come in through the front<end_line>
Girl I had your back when all you used to do was front<end_line>
That's for sure though, I made a career of reminiscin'<end_line>
Time got a funny way of tickin', things are so much different<end_line>
I'll admit it, I've admitted to a lot of things<end_line>
Act like you know it, fuck them stories, fuck the shade that they be throwin'<end_line>
Understand I got responsibilities to people that I need<end_line>
And on my way to make this dough<end_line>
A lot of niggas cut the cheque so they can take this flow<end_line>
A lot of niggas cut the cheque so they can take this flow<end_line>
Tryna give your ass the world<end_line>
You runnin' your fingers through my curls<end_line>
You knew me when the kid had waves<end_line>
But that's enough of that<end_line>
You could never say I came up and forgot about your ass<end_line>
And that's some real shit<end_line>
<verse_end>
