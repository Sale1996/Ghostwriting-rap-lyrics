Look, I'm the property of October<end_line>
I ain't drive here, I got chauffeured<end_line>
Bring me champagne flutes, Ros√© and some shots over<end_line>
I think better when I'm not sober<end_line>
I smoke good ain't no glaucoma, I'm a stockholder<end_line>
Private flights back home, no stop over<end_line>
Still spitting that shit that they shot Pac over<end_line>
The shit my mother look shocked over<end_line>
Yeah, but with a canvas I'm a group of seven<end_line>
A migraine, take two Excedrin<end_line>
I'm the one twice over, I'm the new eleven<end_line>
And if I die I'm a do it repping, I never do a second<end_line>
I swear niggas be eyeing me all hard<end_line>
And lying to they girls and driving the same cars<end_line>
Sitting there wishing they problems became ours<end_line>
Cause we have nothing in common since I done became star<end_line>
I done became bigger swerving writing in my peer's lane<end_line>
Same dudes that used to holler my engineer's name<end_line>
One touch I could make the drapes and the sheers change<end_line>
And show me the city that I without fear claim<end_line>
What I set seems to never extinguish<end_line>
Coolest kid out baby, word to Chuck Inglish<end_line>
Count my own money, see the paper cut fingers<end_line>
My song is your girlfriend's waking up ringer<end_line>
Heh, or alarm, or whatever<end_line>
She be here at six in the morn if I let her<end_line>
But I never get attracted to fans<end_line>
Cause the eager beaver could be the collapse of a dam<end_line>
I always knew that I could figure<end_line>
How to get these label heads to offer him good figures<end_line>
And me doing them shows getting everyone nervous cause<end_line>
Them hipsters going have to get along with them hood niggas<end_line>
It's all good, I'm going off like lights when the show's over<end_line>
Make pasta, rent a movie, called hoes over<end_line>
Rest in peace to Heath Ledger but I'm no joker<end_line>
I'll slow roast you, got no holster<end_line>
Wet glass on your table, nigga no coaster<end_line>
Burn bread everyday boy, no toaster<end_line>
G and Tez got a cig but I'm no smoker<end_line>
They jus handing chips to me nigga, no poker<end_line>
I'm with it, Young Money, Cash Money soldier<end_line>
My cup runnith over<end_line>
The same niggas I ball with, I fall with<end_line>
On some southern drawl shit<end_line>
Rookie of the year, '06 Chris Paul shit<end_line>
D-R., CJ, and Po, I see y'all<end_line>
These cases don't workout I hope we can agree on<end_line>
Making enough to pay any Judge Judy off<end_line>
First thing I'm a do is free Weezy, go<end_line>
