<verse_start>
I hate when<end_line>
I hate when people say they feel me man<end_line>
I hate that shit<end_line>
It'll be a long time before y'all feel me<end_line>
If ever, f'real<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
You won't feel me 'til everybody say they love you, but it's not love<end_line>
And your suit is oxblood and the girl you fucking hates you<end_line>
And your friends faded off shots of, what you ordered<end_line>
then forget about the game that you on top of<end_line>
Your famous girlfriend's ass gettin thicker than the plot does<end_line>
And when you forget her that's when she pop up<end_line>
And you got a drop but you ride around with the top up<end_line>
Or three SUV's for niggaz dressed like refugees<end_line>
And deal with the questions about all your excessive needs<end_line>
And you do dinners at French Laundry in Napa Valley<end_line>
Scallops and glasses of Dolce that shit right up your alley<end_line>
Yeah~! You see a girl and you ask about her<end_line>
Bitches smilin at you, it must be happy hour<end_line>
They put the cloth across your lap soon as you sat down<end_line>
It's feeling like you on every place you choose to be at now<end_line>
Walking through airport security with your hat down<end_line>
Instead of gettin a pat down they just keep on sayin<end_line>
that they feel you nigga<end_line>
It's been too long, it's been way too long<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
You won't feel me 'til you want it so bad you tell yourself you're in it<end_line>
And tell the world around you that yo' paperwork is finished<end_line>
And steal your mother's debit cards so you maintain an image<end_line>
And ride around in overpriced rental cars that ain't tinted<end_line>
You need a minute? You got it<end_line>
You know its real when yo' latest nights are yo' greatest nights<end_line>
The sun is up when you get home, that's just a way of life<end_line>
Apartment 1503 some couches and paintings<end_line>
where you record with two others that want the same things<end_line>
It start to feel better than home feels<end_line>
And so you up there every night, you swear you gettin close<end_line>
That champagne money was for gas and phone bills<end_line>
But shit, you 'bout to spend it on what matters most<end_line>
You drop a couple songs in hopes that you could be the nigga<end_line>
And come out every night to let the city see they nigga<end_line>
Tellin stories that nobody relate to<end_line>
And even though they hate you, they just keep on tellin you<end_line>
they feel you, nigga<end_line>
Yeah, it's been too long man<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Yeah... uhh<end_line>
I haven't been inside Terminal one and three in so long<end_line>
I'm driving right up to it now, make sure you got your coat on<end_line>
That runway can be cold especially after summer's rolled on<end_line>
And all you knew is alcohol and city lights and slow songs<end_line>
For four months out the year, it's got you askin what's good at home<end_line>
What's good at home? The same hoes are still at it I shoulda known<end_line>
My young niggaz poppin M's and sippin Dirty Jones<end_line>
Problem children that all be reppin +October's Own+<end_line>
Brand new girl, and she still growin<end_line>
Brand new titties, stitches still showin<end_line>
Yeah, and she just prayin that it heals good<end_line>
I'm 'bout to fuck and I'm just prayin that it feels good<end_line>
I really don't know much but shit I know a secret<end_line>
They say mo' money mo' problems my nigga don't believe it<end_line>
I mean sure there's some bills and taxes I'm still evadin<end_line>
But I blew six million on myself and I feel amazin<end_line>
Young Money maker, season ticketholder<end_line>
Season switchin over, I come through them bitches<end_line>
still scorchin as if I didn't notice, you niggaz gettin older<end_line>
I see no threat in Yoda<end_line>
I'm out here messin over the lives of these niggaz<end_line>
that couldn't fuck with my freshman floater<end_line>
Look at that fuckin chip on your nephew's shoulder<end_line>
My sophomore I was all for it, they all saw it<end_line>
My junior and senior will only get meaner - +Take Care+ nigga<end_line>
