Yeah~! Smokin weed under star projectors<end_line>
I guess we'll never know what Harvard gets us<end_line>
But seein my family have it all<end_line>
took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall<end_line>
And really I think I like who I'm becomin<end_line>
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothin<end_line>
There's times when I might blow like 50K on a vacation<end_line>
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces<end_line>
All it took was patience<end_line>
I got a lot of friends to come up off the strip for me<end_line>
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me<end_line>
The realest niggaz say yo' lyrics do shit for me<end_line>
I told my story, then made hi-story<end_line>
Tell them I'mma need reservations for 20<end_line>
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah<end_line>
I'd much rather spend it all while I'm breathin<end_line>
That O.V.O. and XO is everythin you believe in, I know<end_line>
