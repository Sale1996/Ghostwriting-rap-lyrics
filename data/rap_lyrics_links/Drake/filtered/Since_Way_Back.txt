Girl, I know you know already<end_line>
Girl, I know you know already<end_line>
Things are gettin' hot and heavy<end_line>
Things are gettin' hot and heavy<end_line>
Girl, I know you know already<end_line>
Girl, I know you<end_line>
Girl, I know you<end_line>

You said that you think about me every day<end_line>
Saturday to Saturday<end_line>
You see that I've been goin' through it<end_line>
Hopin' everything's okay<end_line>
I just want to let you know<end_line>
Everything these days is textual<end_line>
I just want to get a little sexual, with you<end_line>
Because I remember way, way back<end_line>
With the waves under the wavecap<end_line>
You were someone else's wife in fact<end_line>
You didn't even look at me like that<end_line>
Then it all just switched, over time<end_line>
Step by step and you know what's next<end_line>
Girl, I can't pretend<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Girl, I know you know already<end_line>
What haven't we done before?<end_line>
What is not already mine?<end_line>
Couldn't tell you were special<end_line>
Yeah, you know already<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Six months since I've been back in the Six<end_line>
I can't help but wonder how you've been, babe<end_line>
What are you on?<end_line>
Gotta let me know something<end_line>
What are you on?<end_line>
Gotta let me know something<end_line>
What are you on?<end_line>
Gotta let me know something<end_line>
Wonder how you've been<end_line>
I've been out in Bel-Air like Will was<end_line>
These streets got so familiar<end_line>
Malibu coast where I meditate<end_line>
Book a plane home, then I hesitate<end_line>
Scared to see what I left behind<end_line>
It's weighin' heavy on my mind<end_line>
And I can't help but wonder how you've been, baby<end_line>
What are you on?<end_line>
Gotta let me know something<end_line>
What are you on?<end_line>
Gotta let me know something<end_line>
What are you on?<end_line>
Gotta let me know something<end_line>
Wonder how you've been, babe<end_line>
