Sometimes I feel like Lohan and Hilary Duff are the only ones with enough<end_line>
To feel what I'm about to say in this song<end_line>
When they want you to be like somebody else and you just want to be yourself<end_line>
And you do it and get the feeling it's wrong<end_line>
That there is when all the press articles happening and the cameras get tosnapping<end_line>
And they try to make you out as a lie<end_line>
Symbolic because you were just trying to please them by using logic and reason<end_line>
It's a lose lose why even try<end_line>
When your ideas so frequently get rejected, people just get neglected<end_line>
And they never really know how to feel<end_line>
Phone calls is something that you're expecting for someone without the ethics <end_line>
And the motives to try and make them a mill<end_line>
You never noticed the fact you might be working without receiving the perks and<end_line>
Niggas wanna say that you ain't around<end_line>
I mean there's always some blame to put on yourself instead of claiming<end_line>
that you couldn't help and maybe next time you ain't in town<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
And the managers make you succumb to pressure and you spitting' isfresher <end_line>
than most of these rappers running the game<end_line>
Concerned that people who copy what's in the past and turn the profit with cash<end_line>
There's time I would have done it the same<end_line>
I mean I got me a range, Also got me a guilty conscience<end_line>
That made you tell anybody I meet that I rent<end_line>
Sometimes I wish that I would just chilled on the sneakers<end_line>
and watched the gamefrom the bleachers<end_line>
Because I'm really tend to need what I spent<end_line>
In a house that I promised to get my mother don't compensate for the other time<end_line>
I wasted late out at the club<end_line>
Instead of sitting in once a week for some dinner I'm working hard on thewinner <end_line>
so this album is a labor of love<end_line>
You say as long as I'm staying out of the streets and just spending money onbeats <end_line>
That she can rest without a toss and a turn<end_line>
Because she know that my reputation perceives me and people watch me on TV<end_line>
That's exactly why I often get burned<end_line>
But I'm gonna try to..<end_line>
