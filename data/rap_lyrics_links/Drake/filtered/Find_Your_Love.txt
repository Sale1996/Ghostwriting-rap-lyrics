<verse_start>
I'm more than just an option<end_line>
Refuse to be forgotten<end_line>
I took a chance with my heart<end_line>
And I feel it takin over<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I'm more than just a number<end_line>
I doubt you'll find another<end_line>
So every single summer<end_line>
I'll be the one that you'll remember, and<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
It's more than just a mission<end_line>
You hear but you don't listen<end_line>
You better pay attention<end_line>
And get what you've been missin<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Too many times, I've been wrong<end_line>
I guess bein right, takes too long<end_line>
I'm done waitin, there's nothin left to do<end_line>
but give all I have to you and<end_line>
I better find yo' lovin<end_line>
I better find yo' heart<end_line>
I better find yo' lovin<end_line>
I bet if I give all my love then nothing's gonna tear us apart<end_line>
<verse_end>
