<verse_start>
Tryna stay light on my toes<end_line>
Just ran a light in a Rolls<end_line>
Told me I'm lookin' exhausted<end_line>
You hit it right on the nose<end_line>
I'm tired of all of these niggas<end_line>
I'm tired of all of these hoes<end_line>
Worried 'bout takin' my lane<end_line>
They ain't even got on my road<end_line>
They turn they back and they leave you<end_line>
They gon' be back when they need you<end_line>
I practice good over evil<end_line>
Flippin' the script like a read-through<end_line>
Yeah, all of my brothers, we equal<end_line>
I play my part too, like a sequel<end_line>
You tell your niggas you got 'em on anything<end_line>
Question is, do they believe you?<end_line>
'Specially when you never come through<end_line>
So much hate inside your heart<end_line>
We don't even know what we done to you<end_line>
We just know shit gettin' run through<end_line>
Never chase it, let it come to you<end_line>
You out here tellin' everybody everything<end_line>
You niggas move like the one-two, yeah<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
And more chune for your headtop<end_line>
So watch how you speak on my name, you know?<end_line>
