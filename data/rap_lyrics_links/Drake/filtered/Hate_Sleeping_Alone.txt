She says "Kiss me like you miss me, fuck me like you hate me<end_line>
And when you're fuckin someone else just fuck her like she ain't me"<end_line>
Damn, those words are scary, those words are scary Virgin Mary<end_line>
I just tell her to spare me - I was in love two years ago<end_line>

Bags she deserved to carry - I hate that hoe<end_line>
I made it so hard just to talk, don't I? I get off topic, don't I?<end_line>
I get it poppin, don't I? I'll end up stoppin, won't I?<end_line>
And by the time I end up stoppin you'll be rockin one of the rings <end_line>

Uh, she's losin it right now<end_line>
Cause if I wasn't who I am she woulda been movin in by now<end_line>
But instead we're movin slow, I guess she's used to it by now<end_line>
And she gives me all her trust and I'm abusin it right now<end_line>

Hotel to hotel, girl I could use yo' company<end_line>
Full name and birthday, I'll book a flight and you come to me<end_line>
But don't want a weekend, she wants all of me and none of me<end_line>
If she can't work with all of me then she says she's done with me<end_line>
You say that you're over me, you always end up under me<end_line>
You know how it goes, don't be crazy, don't play dumb with me<end_line>
Don't start with yo' shit, I'll put you back in yo' place<end_line>
She tells me "I bet you won't, you won't say that to my face"<end_line>
And hangs up, yeah; how dare you tell me it's tougher for you?<end_line>
Like I don't hear about the niggaz you fuckin with too<end_line>
And whoever I be with they got nothin on you<end_line>
That's just somethin to do when there's nothin to do<end_line>
Yeah, but she's losin it right now<end_line>
She has choices she should make, I think she's choosin it right now<end_line>
One more chance to make it right I think I'm usin it right now<end_line>
