<verse_start>
I'm tryna do it all, tonight...<end_line>
I got plans, I got a certain lust, for life...<end_line>
And as it stands, everything is going as right...<end_line>
as it can; they tryna shoot down my flight...<end_line>
before it lands...before it lands<end_line>
But you could miss me with all that...<end_line>
Diss me then crawl back<end_line>
I really wish y'all would fall back<end_line>
But gettin rich s'pose to solve that<end_line>
And these days women make offers <end_line>
and who the hell am I to say<end_line>
My ex sendin late night text <end_line>
'cause she don't know how to let<end_line>
Uh, she in love...<end_line>
And as for them pretty light-skinned models standin in the cold <end_line>
Ah yeah, they wit us...<end_line>
Let them girls in for a drink...<end_line>
And I'm all... in they ear...<end_line>
Sayin she should be the one I see...<end_line>
Everytime... that I'm here... <end_line>
but when am I really even here?<end_line>
Black Surburban wit the tint on it<end_line>
Fresher than a pillow with a mint on it<end_line>
The game got these old hand prints on it<end_line>
but I'ma be the one to pour cement on it...<end_line>
Uh...and start over<end_line>
And show up in a Mars yellow tux<end_line>
I don't really give a fuck and we only gettin older<end_line>
So what I tend to do is to think... of today... as the past<end_line>
It's funny when you comin in first... but you hope... that you last<end_line>
You just hope... that it last...<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Throw your ones up in the aiiir...<end_line>
Throw your ones up in the air for her, ooh-oh...<end_line>
Throw your ones up, in the air...<end_line>
Throw your ones up...<end_line>
<verse_end>
