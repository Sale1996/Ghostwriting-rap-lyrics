<verse_start>
First off you know what it is if you heard Drake <end_line>
Makin hoes wobble like a bridge in a earthquake<end_line>
Never see me out cuz I live in my workplace<end_line>
I give you the business, so button up your shirt straight<end_line>
Look at where I landed, you would think I planned it<end_line>
I'm just doin me and you can never understand it<end_line>
Chicks get hammered, big dick bandit<end_line>
Money flowin like a slit wrist, no bandage<end_line>
Blowin purple clouds nigga, I'm so sky high<end_line>
I ain't cuttin anybody slices outta my pie<end_line>
Outta this world though, I'm so sci-fi<end_line>
And I don't sit still I keep it movin like a drive by<end_line>
I just tell the truth and so I'm good in every hood spot<end_line>
21 years and I ain't ever met a good cop<end_line>
Me and Wayne lean like Kareem doin hook shots<end_line>
Cover me I'm goin in I'm buckin when the hook drops<end_line>
