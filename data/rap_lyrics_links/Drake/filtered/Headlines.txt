I might be too strung out on compliments, overdosed on confidence<end_line>
Started not to give a fuck and stop fearin the consequence<end_line>
Drinkin every night because we drink to my accomplishments<end_line>
Faded way too long, I'm floatin in and out of consciousness<end_line>
And they sayin I'm back, I'd agree with that<end_line>
I just take my time with all this shit, I still believe in that<end_line>
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh I needed that<end_line>
And they wanna see me pick back up, well where'd I leave it at?<end_line>
I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that<end_line>
Tuck my napkin in my shirt cause I'm just mobbin like that<end_line>
You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that<end_line>
You gon' make someone around me catch a body like that<end_line>
Nooo, don't do it, please don't do it<end_line>
Cause one of us goes in and we all go through it<end_line>
And Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy gon' pay it<end_line>
Those my brothers, I ain't even gotta say it<end_line>
That's just somethin they know<end_line>
<verse_end>

Yeah, I be yellin out money over everything, money on my mind<end_line>
Then she wanna ask when it got so empty<end_line>
Tell her I apologize, happened over time<end_line>
She says they miss the old Drake, girl don't tempt me<end_line>
If they don't get it they'll be ooooover you<end_line>
That new shit that you got is ooooover-due<end_line>
You better do what you suppooooosed to do<end_line>
I'm like "Why it gotta be all that?" But still I can't deny the fact<end_line>
that it's, true, listen to you expressin all them feelings<end_line>
Soap opera rappers, all these niggaz sound like +All My Children+<end_line>
And that's who you thinkin is 'bout to come and make a killin<end_line>
I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions<end_line>
You know that they ain't even got it like that<end_line>
You gon' hype me up and make me catch a body like that<end_line>
Cause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that<end_line>
When they get my shit and play it; I ain't even gotta say it<end_line>
They know<end_line>
<verse_end>

They know, they know, they know<end_line>
