And when you get to toppin, I see that you've been learnin<end_line>
And when you get to shopping, you spend it like you earned it<end_line>
And when you popped off on your ex, he deserved it<end_line>
I thought you were the one from the jump, that confirmed it<end_line>
I buy you champagne but you love some Henny<end_line>
