<verse_start>
It's your worst nightmare, it's my first night here<end_line>
And this girl right here, who knows what she knows?<end_line>
So I'm goin through her phone if she go to the bathroom<end_line>
and her purse right there, I don't trust these hoes at all<end_line>
But that's just the result of me payin attention<end_line>
To all these women that think like men with the same intentions<end_line>
Talkin strippers and models that try to gain attention<end_line>
Even a couple porn stars that I'm ashamed to mention<end_line>
But Weezy and Stunna my only role models<end_line>
Hefner and Jordan my only role models<end_line>
That's why I walk around with all this gold on<end_line>
And every time I run into these niggaz they want no problems<end_line>
Bottom sixes and chains, and some bracelets and rings<end_line>
All of the little accents that make me a king<end_line>
I never hear the disses they try and point out to me<end_line>
But it's whatever if somebody want make it a thing<end_line>
I'm more concerned what niggaz thinkin about Christmas in August<end_line>
Do anythin to buy gifts for they daughters<end_line>
Get some shake, a brick in the press<end_line>
and chef it like Mrs. Fields; they makin the cookie stretch<end_line>
I know it so well, I know the hustle so well<end_line>
Stunt like I'm workin overnighters right by the motel<end_line>
Drug money outfit, record clean<end_line>
Spend it all on me and my fuckin team<end_line>
Matchin Rollies for real, matchin Rovers for real<end_line>
Places they say they've been we've actually goin for real<end_line>
I'm really killin shit, fuck all the jiggy rapping<end_line>
I'm goin trigger happy just to see my niggaz happy<end_line>
Mixtape legend, underground kings<end_line>
Lookin for the right way to do the wrong things<end_line>
With my new bitch that's livin in Palm Springs<end_line>
Young-ass nigga, lifelong dreams<end_line>
They take the greats from the past and compare us<end_line>
I wonder if they'd ever survive in this era<end_line>
In a time where it's recreation to pull all yo'<end_line>
skeletons out the closet like Halloween decorations<end_line>
I know of all the things that I hear they be pokin fun at<end_line>
Never the flow though, they know I run that<end_line>
Fuck you all, I claim that whenever<end_line>
I changed rap forever, the game back together yeah<end_line>
YM, I remain that forever<end_line>
In the same place my brother Wayne at forever<end_line>
I'm a descendent of either Marley or Hendrix<end_line>
I haven't figured it out cause my story is far from finished<end_line>
I'm hearin all of the jokes, I know that they tryin to push me<end_line>
I know that showin emotion don't ever mean I'm a pussy<end_line>
Know that I don't make music for niggaz who don't get pussy<end_line>
So those are the ones I count on to diss me or overlook me<end_line>
Lord knows, Lord knows, I'm heavy I got my weight up<end_line>
Roll this and boost your rate up, it's time that somebody paid up<end_line>
A lot of niggaz came up off of a style that I made up<end_line>
But if all I hear is me, then who should I be afraid of?<end_line>
Bought a white Ghost, now shit is gettin spooky<end_line>
Very very scary, like shit you see in the movies<end_line>
In this bitch all drinks on the house like Snoopy<end_line>
That's why all the real soldiers salute me<end_line>
Trill nigga, for real<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I fell in love with the pen, started fuckin the ink<end_line>
The hustle's an art, I paint it what I would think<end_line>
Still allergic to broke, prescription straight to the paper<end_line>
Destined for greatness but got a place in Jamaica<end_line>
Villa on the water with the wonderful views<end_line>
Only fat nigga in the sauna with Jews<end_line>
Went and got a yacht I'm talkin Carnival cruise<end_line>
And these niggaz talkin like hoes they mad they not in my shoes<end_line>
It's the red bottom boss, came to buy the bar<end_line>
Every bi-week shit, I'm bound to buy a car<end_line>
Murder-cedes Benz or that bubble double R<end_line>
Headlights flickin lookin like a fallin star<end_line>
Everyday them hammers bang, whippin yay like Annie Mae<end_line>
I run the game but the ladies think I'm runnin game<end_line>
Mink coats make your woman wanna fornicate<end_line>
Rozay and Drake, I'm gettin cake, nothin short of great<end_line>
