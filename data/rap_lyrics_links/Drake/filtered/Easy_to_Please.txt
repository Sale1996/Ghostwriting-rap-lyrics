Yeah, look...<end_line>
Me and sos? we from two different walks of life<end_line>
usually we understand theres a problem we don't talk to vice<end_line>

I never signed for a mill' but been offered twice<end_line>
I'm awful nice, lyrics that I often write<end_line>
Spyin no talent rappers to get off the mic<end_line>
And I could pick you up from work when you get off the night<end_line>
drop you at the house soon as you get off the pike, man<end_line>
I flow so cool like autumn nights<end_line>
When I body this, tell me if the coffin's light<end_line>
but don't try and tell me that a dolphins white<end_line>
mislead drake that is not at all polite<end_line>
It's a shame cause that's how the biz goes<end_line>
Imagine if these other niggas flop and his blows<end_line>

They'll be trynna sub a nigga in like Quizno's<end_line>
