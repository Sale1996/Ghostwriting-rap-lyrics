<verse_start>
Still in Miami<end_line>
Most of these girls are too messy<end_line>
I've got to do some reflecting<end_line>
I've got to find me one out here that is good at taking direction<end_line>
I'm convinced that my calls are being recorded<end_line>
So hit my assistant to get me the message<end_line>
And make the connection like brrrrr<end_line>
I'm on my way tonight I hope you not the crazy type<end_line>
I'm in your state tonight I might just break the bank tonight<end_line>
PND ain't with the ray tay tay<end_line>
You know Jay Wray<end_line>
Got girls her going way way way way way way<end_line>
Sauga city trip the pay day<end_line>
Load up off a gate way<end_line>
Man you can't afford me<end_line>
Doing is one thing, doing it right is a whole different story<end_line>
Niggas is all in their feelings these days, all in their feelings these days<end_line>
But hearing the scripture with that many sixes you should be afraid<end_line>
<verse_end>
