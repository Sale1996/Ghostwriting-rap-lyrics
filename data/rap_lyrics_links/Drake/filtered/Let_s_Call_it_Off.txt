Uh, when did you get like this?<end_line>
Least you coulda done is gone and give me a warning<end_line>
I don't regret like this<end_line>
So I'll be right there when you wake up in the morning<end_line>
Saying, this just ain't my style<end_line>
You can't say you're happy either<end_line>
You don't even smile, for me<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
When you decided to knock on my door<end_line>
Did you remember what happened before<end_line>
The look on your face said you were expecting more<end_line>
But some things look better inside of the store<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Look, Leave me, leave me, I can't fuckin stand you<end_line>
Wish I had the courage to say everything I planned to<end_line>
My girlfriend, my girlfriend, call herself my girlfriend<end_line>
Tell me that we 'pposed to be together 'til the world end<end_line>
But, I don't really feel that<end_line>
I just really wanna turn the wheels back<end_line>
Give you all your sweaters and your heels back<end_line>
Convince you that time will heal that<end_line>
Uh, you look for reasons for us to argue<end_line>
I swear everytime I call<end_line>
You just tell me how I don't call you<end_line>
Why you do that... do that... do that<end_line>
<verse_end>
