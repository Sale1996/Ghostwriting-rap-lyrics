Having conversations with mama, man my life is a mess<end_line>
Ain't been returning the texts, so she been reading the press<end_line>
She got google alerts, them shits go straight to her phone<end_line>
She worry bout me from home, you know she raised me alone<end_line>
She said "I heard you back with you know who"<end_line>
I told her "Girl I'm always back with you know who"<end_line>
And she like "Who are we kidding"<end_line>
"You're only 27 you just being you"<end_line>
"You're your fathers child man thank god you got some me in you"<end_line>
At least I always, at least I always see it through<end_line>
At least I'm always being true to what you taught me<end_line>
Retired teacher but your words still got me evolving<end_line>
Never get sloppy drunk, but alcohol is problem solving<end_line>
And look I hate it when you hate on all my girlfriends<end_line>
And assistants always convinced that there's always someone better<end_line>
Like that girl from that gym who trains you<end_line>
I know you wanna arrange it, you told me she's free thursday<end_line>
And I'm sure that she's a angel but she don't want this life<end_line>
The timing ain't right<end_line>
Maybe one day but even one day with us is a time of a life<end_line>
We do things that people pay to document<end_line>
You got the sweetest heart but I'm not here to give out compliments, or boost nobody confidence momma<end_line>
I got no friends in this momma<end_line>
I don't pretend with this momma<end_line>
I'on joke with this momma<end_line>
I pull the knife out my back and cut they throat with it momma<end_line>
I'm "Game of Thrones" with it momma<end_line>
I'm "Home Alone" with it momma<end_line>
I'm t-<end_line>
I really hate using this tone with you momma<end_line>
I really hate getting aggressive on this phone with you momma<end_line>
I really hate wasting your time to check a clone or two momma<end_line>
It's just they cloning me momma<end_line>
Them niggas wannabes momma<end_line>
Its like - I'm the one they wanna be momma<end_line>
I just- I- I can't be out here being vulnerable momma<end_line>
I mean I kill em every time they do a song with me momma<end_line>
I sing a hook they sing along with me momma<end_line>
What more they want from me momma?<end_line>
Yeah, this is a crazy life<end_line>
But you and the six raised me right<end_line>
"Don't ever take advice," that was great advice<end_line>
You and the six raised me right, that shit saved my life<end_line>

<verse_start>
Having conversations with momma, we start talkin' bout dad<end_line>
You know he dropping a single, he saying this is his window<end_line>
That nigga still wearing linen, that nigga still in the club<end_line>
Call him after we get off the phone and show him some love<end_line>
That nigga memphis for real, girl he love you to death<end_line>
He made mistakes throughout his life that he still doesn't accept<end_line>
But he just want our forgiveness, and fuck it look how we living<end_line>
I'm content with this story, who are we not to forgive him?<end_line>
At least I been to a prison, at least I know what it's like<end_line>
I used to rap on the phone, one of his friends doing life<end_line>
And now I got me a Grammy, that could be part of the reason<end_line>
Let's just call this shit even, we got some things to believe in<end_line>
Do you remember back to Weston Road, Scarlett Road?<end_line>
Hangin' with Aaron Bell and Reny shit could've gone south for me he looked out for me ma<end_line>
He never let me do drugs<end_line>
He let me shoot a gun one summer but out there everyone does<end_line>
He made me listen to his music, old music, soul music<end_line>
Shit that can only be created if you go through it<end_line>
I used to get teased for being black, and now I'm here and I'm not black enough<end_line>
Cause I'm not acting tough or making stories up bout where I'm actually from<end_line>
But I just roll with it momma, rolling stone with it momma<end_line>
Gotta be careful around rolling stones or anyone that's tryna throw stones at me momma<end_line>
I'm not condoning it momma<end_line>
They will not tear nothing down I built this home for you momma<end_line>
Know I don't call enough momma<end_line>
I just been working with so little time for personal momma<end_line>
Hard labor let me pay the price<end_line>
You and the six raised me right that shit saved my life<end_line>
