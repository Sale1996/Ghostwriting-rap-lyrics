Tonight I'm into breakin up, somebody's home<end_line>
I'm drunk as ever, I'm not alone<end_line>
I-I-I-I'm with my people, I know you love it<end_line>
I don't just do it, I over-does it<end_line>
I been gettin money so long it's just paper to me<end_line>
Take all my memories with you and just erase it for me<end_line>
You can never reminisce, when you forget it all<end_line>
Careful what you wish for, you just might get it all<end_line>
Now my life is angel hair and Pinot Grigio baby forget about it<end_line>
I'm headed wherever this motherfuckin jet is routed<end_line>
You can't have my heart, the doctor told me I'd be dead without it<end_line>
My judgment's never clouded<end_line>
That's why I'm steady yellin weatherman weatherman, I'm 'bout whatever man<end_line>
I'm tryin to fuck with Tinkerbell in Never Neverland<end_line>
But I'm polite about it, baby after you<end_line>
I've had a glass or two so<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Tryin to get the green like I'm waitin at a long light<end_line>
Broke just doesn't suit me girl and every night is prom night<end_line>
Where'd I put my bowtie? Millionaire, multi<end_line>
Rest in peace to B.I.G. and praises to the most high<end_line>
Gettin stupid paid, off of smart decisions<end_line>
I'm the man now, I guess that part's a given<end_line>
Someone please tell me the problem with my competition<end_line>
I ask what's up and they just always say "The cost of livin"<end_line>
I learn from it though, I been down and I got up<end_line>
Bring a hundred thousand to the club and light yo' spot up<end_line>
And me fallin and landin in love I don't think should happen<end_line>
because everything's easier to get into then get out of<end_line>
But someone show me to the owner of this city<end_line>
cause the owner's always seem to be the only people with me<end_line>
I'm still the mafia, still run the committee<end_line>
N.Y. forever nigga Diddy, uh<end_line>
<verse_end>
