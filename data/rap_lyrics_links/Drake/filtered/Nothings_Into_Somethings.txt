Big cup of Ac', I'm drowsy<end_line>
I'm still posted up where you first found me<end_line>
Did I just read that you just got engaged on me?<end_line>
I heard from your friend, you couldn't even tell me<end_line>
Or better yet wait on me<end_line>

Nah, should have known nah-nah-nah<end_line>
Should have known nah-nah-nah<end_line>
Can't just leave it off that way<end_line>
Should have known nah-nah-nah<end_line>
Should have known nah<end_line>
Can't just leave it off that way, nah<end_line>

Least, do I get an invitation or something?<end_line>
A statement or something?<end_line>
Ask about that, you would say it was nothing<end_line>
But here's another nothing that you made into something<end_line>
Can't just leave it off that way<end_line>
