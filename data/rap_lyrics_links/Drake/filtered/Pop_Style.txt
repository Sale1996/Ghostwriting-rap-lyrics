Tell my mom I love her if I do not make it, do not make it<end_line>
Got so many chains they call me Chaining Tatum<end_line>
They do, they do<end_line>
And I like to finish what you think you started<end_line>
Man you boys just got to Hollywood, you boys just started<end_line>
You don't know what you just started<end_line>
All I do is hang with the young and heartless<end_line>
All this is for my family, man, I try my hardest<end_line>
It's all I ever did and look where it got him<end_line>
Yeah, you've been on my mind lately<end_line>
You've still got my number, girl you need to call me<end_line>
I feel like they wanna see me learn the hard way<end_line>
But you know I always handle that one my way<end_line>
Girl let me rock, rock, rock, rock, rock your body<end_line>
Justin Timberlake and then I hit the highway<end_line>
I can't trust no fuckin' body<end_line>
They still out to get me cause they never got me<end_line>
