Yeah, 9th Wonder! Don't judge me man<end_line>
They tend to say that us rappers are materialistic<end_line>
They say we lack substance<end_line>
Me, 'Te and El' bout to prove 'em wrong though<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Uh, El' be saying that I'm humble, I'm hella nice<end_line>
For that I've been approached to sign to Roc-A-Fella twice<end_line>
Haters tell you all the rumors they heard<end_line>
and we laugh soon as you come and tell me like I'm Ellen Brice<end_line>
My groove theory is that when you too cheery<end_line>
they try to bring you down to the level they at<end_line>
Well when they are all unhappy, then it gets a little sticky<end_line>
That's why I am Little Nicky to these devils in rap<end_line>
But, uh, they ain't thinking Drake get smart girl<end_line>
Nah, they probably think I'll break your heart girl<end_line>
Haha, I can't lie, you probably right about it<end_line>
and if you give me the ass quick, I'll probably write about it<end_line>
But I hate it when they judge me on how I sound<end_line>
I mean I spit that influential shit from my town<end_line>
I don't know why you sitting on the couch<end_line>
when you see I got a bed, bring your ass here and lie down<end_line>
You think taking your purse off<end_line>
will lead to me, you taking shirts off and then your skirt off<end_line>
At least I got status because I could've been a local emcee<end_line>
and you probably would've been worse off<end_line>
So I'ma take this hat off, and I'ma hit it till I backs off<end_line>
and then I'm back sorrowful<end_line>
Cause you thinking you can predict what happen<end_line>
You the reason I'm thinking I'm getting sick of rapping<end_line>
<verse_end>
