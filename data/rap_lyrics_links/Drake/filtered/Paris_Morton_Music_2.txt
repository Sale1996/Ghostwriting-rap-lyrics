Yeah, uh.. look, fuck all that "happy to be here" shit that y'all want me on<end_line>
I'm the big homie, they still be tryna lil bro me, dog<end_line>
Like I should fall in line, like I should alert niggas<end_line>
when I'm 'bout to drop something crazy and not say I'm the greatest<end_line>
of my generation; like I should be dressin' different<end_line>
Like I should be less aggressive and pessimistic<end_line>
Like I should be way more nervous and less dismissive<end_line>
Like I should be on my best behavior and not talk my shit<end_line>
And do it major like the niggas who paved the way for us<end_line>
Like I didn't study the game to the letter<end_line>
and understand that I'm not doing it the same, man, I'm doing it better<end_line>
Like I didn't make that clearer this year<end_line>
Like I should feel, I don't know, guilty for saying that<end_line>
They should put a couple more mirrors in here so I can stare at myself<end_line>
These are usually just some thoughts that I would share with myself<end_line>
But I thought "Fuck it", it's worth it to share 'em with someone else other than Paris for once<end_line>
I text her from time to time, she a mom now<end_line>
I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down<end_line>
I told her she could live with me if she need to, I got a compound <end_line>
but I think she's straight.. cause she supported <end_line>
since Hot Beats right before Wayne came and got me out of the backroom <end_line>
where I was rappin' with Jazz over beats that I shouldn't have in the hopes for the glory<end_line>
He walked right past in the hallway<end_line>
3 months later, I'm his artist, he probably wouldn't remember that story<end_line>
But that shit stick with me<end_line>
Always couldn't believe when he called me, you never know, it could happen to you<end_line>
And I just spent four Ferrari's all on a brand new Bugatti<end_line>
and did that shit cause it's something to do<end_line>
Yeah, I guess that's just who I became, dawg<end_line>
+Nothing was the Same+, dawg<end_line>
