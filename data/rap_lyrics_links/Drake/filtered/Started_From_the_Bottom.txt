I done kept it real from the jump<end_line>
Livin at my momma house, we'd argue every month<end_line>
Nigga I was tryin to get it on my own<end_line>
Workin all night, traffic on the way home<end_line>
And my uncle callin me like, "Where ya at?<end_line>
I gave you the keys, told ya bring it right back"<end_line>
Nigga I just think it's funny how it goes<end_line>
Now I'm on the road, half a million for a show<end_line>

<verse_start>
Boys tell stories 'bout the man<end_line>
Say I never struggled, wasn't hungry, yeah I doubt it nigga<end_line>
I could turn your boy into the man<end_line>
There ain't really much I hear that's poppin off without us nigga<end_line>
We just want the credit where it's due<end_line>
I'ma worry about me, give a fuck about you<end_line>
Nigga just as a reminder to myself<end_line>
I wear every single chain even when I'm in the house<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
No new niggaz, nigga we don't feel that<end_line>
Fuck a fake friend, where your real friends at?<end_line>
We don't like to do too much explainin<end_line>
Stories stay the same, I never changed it<end_line>
No new niggaz, nigga we don't feel that<end_line>
Fuck a fake friend, where your real friends at?<end_line>
We don't like to do too much explainin<end_line>
Stories stay the same through the money and the fame<end_line>
<verse_end>
