<verse_start>
Uh, I'm just +So Far Gone+ <end_line>
October's own <end_line>
Please leave me alone<end_line>
Drunk off champagne screamin' in the phone<end_line>
See my house is not a home<end_line>
Fuck is goin' on<end_line>
Where did we go wrong?<end_line>
Where do we belong?<end_line>
Caught up in the game and it's one I can't postpone<end_line>
Meaning if it rains, I'm the one it's raining on<end_line>
When my diamond chain is on still nothing set in stone<end_line>
Women borrow sweaters that I spray with my cologne<end_line>
And tell me don't forget 'em and I promise that I won't<end_line>
Feelin' so distant from everyone I've known<end_line>
To make everybody happy I think I would need a clone<end_line>
Places we get flown<end_line>
Parties that we've thrown<end_line>
I've done more for this city then these rappers that have blown<end_line>
It's only been 3 Years look at how I've grown<end_line>
I'm just in my zone<end_line>
I call this shit the calm, Yeah<end_line>
But I'm the furthest thing from calm<end_line>
Dedicated to my mom, and I swear my word is bond<end_line>
Everything will be ok and it won't even take that long<end_line>
You can see it in my face or even read it on my palm<end_line>
Leader of the new school it's proven and it's known<end_line>
I'm sittin' in a chair but in the future it's a throne<end_line>
I know you like to worry it'll be better if you don't cause...<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Uh, And life is so insane<end_line>
Look what I've became<end_line>
Tryna make a name<end_line>
All my first dates are interrupted by my fame<end_line>
Because every picture taken is a fan that you can gain<end_line>
They love it when you smile unaware that it's a strain<end_line>
It's a curse you gotta live with when you're born to entertain<end_line>
Women need attention therefore women will complain<end_line>
Develop hatred for men and say that you're the one to blame<end_line>
Tryna enjoy myself with Taz in Miami at the game<end_line>
I just wish he knew how much it really weighed like Dwayne<end_line>
It's a weight that's on my chest whoever spottin' me is playin'<end_line>
So I'm liftin' all alone try not to get a sprain<end_line>
Hopin' Western Union doing currency exchange<end_line>
Cause my dad called and got me feelin' guilty and ashamed<end_line>
Like, how I had a Rolls and I went and got a Range<end_line>
And he payin' for his cigarettes with dollars and some change<end_line>
Damn, and I could only feel his pain<end_line>
Cause in Memphis Tennessee there's only so much to attain<end_line>
So I'm fillin' out the form at the counter once again<end_line>
He say he love me I just hope he doesn't say that shit in vain<end_line>
Ohio girl heart is in a slang<end_line>
Call me heartbreak Drake I'm the hardest one to tame<end_line>
As a man I'm just honest<end_line>
As a artist I'm a king<end_line>
With my own set of problems that be sittin' on my brain<end_line>
Yea, And see this is the thang<end_line>
What they viewing as braggin' is the way that I maintain<end_line>
The shit I write while staring out the window of a plane<end_line>
Is the single handed reason I remain... Me, yeah<end_line>
<verse_end>
