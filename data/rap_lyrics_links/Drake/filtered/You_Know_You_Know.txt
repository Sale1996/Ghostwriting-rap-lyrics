You know you know, how the story go<end_line>
You done jocked my style, you done stole my flow<end_line>
You done seen me out, you gets no hello<end_line>
And you wonder why, man you know you know<end_line>
Yeah, and you should let them boys know too<end_line>
Show them niggaz every single thing I showed you<end_line>
I'm here feelin like 50 back in '02<end_line>
when e'rybody's sayin I'm the man, so true<end_line>
Yeah, but what does it take to feel secure<end_line>
A place with wooden floors, some space to put awards<end_line>
A couple of parkin spots and maids to do the chores<end_line>
The cars you always wanted and women that you adooooored<end_line>
Well I got it, I got it<end_line>
I wonder if I'll be happy without it, I doubt it<end_line>
I try not to really think about it<end_line>
I made it but I'm still playin like I'm bein scouted 'til I'm outed<end_line>
Game time bitch, I hope you're proud of us<end_line>
King James shit, watch me throw the powder up<end_line>
This O.G. got my whole suite cloudin up<end_line>
And I bet you I'll be out of time 'fore I'm out of luck<end_line>
They ain't rootin for me, they ain't clappin for me<end_line>
I'm only sayin could somebody just be happy for me?<end_line>
I really hate to say "I told you so"<end_line>
So I bite my tongue, but you know you know<end_line>

<verse_start>
Uhh, please make your long story shorter<end_line>
Cause time is of the essence for the king of first quarter<end_line>
Numbers do the talkin, I have nothin for reporters<end_line>
I just hope we make these flights and don't get held up at the border<end_line>
Yeah, so you could spare me all the accolades<end_line>
I'm the reason you could find my city on a atlas page<end_line>
Half a million dollars later and my tax is paid<end_line>
And I'm still spendin money from my actin days<end_line>
Damn, life is such a lovely thing<end_line>
Feel the perks that a seven-figure budget bring<end_line>
Tell your girlfriend that I could pull some fuckin strings<end_line>
So at courtside, will LeBron get a fuckin ring?<end_line>
Yeah, I bet I'll be there, I'll be there<end_line>
You see that '62 sittin outside, that's me there<end_line>
I'm jumpin to the top, that's my leap year, prepare<end_line>
Puttin in that overtime I never said it'd be fair<end_line>
I'm always left wishin that I coulda done it in person<end_line>
My apologies to all of the ones I was hurtin<end_line>
I got new girls, but none of they love was for certain<end_line>
And call old girls but none of they numbers are workin<end_line>
Damn, what happened to us?<end_line>
Life can always change, you have to adjust<end_line>
How come when I got a party you stare at me in disgust?<end_line>
They pay us just to have fun, you should see that as a plus<end_line>
Especially when I come flyin through the door, and kindly ignore<end_line>
the paparazzi outside tryin to record<end_line>
Why has every women never dined here before?<end_line>
Am I the only 23-year old wine connoisseur?<end_line>
The Rothschilds, the Crus, the 'caias and the Opuses<end_line>
It's always nice when you're out with someone that notices<end_line>
My condo got that art gallery openness<end_line>
I'm just really hopin that that isn't what your motive is<end_line>
They ain't rootin for me, they ain't clappin for me<end_line>
I'm only sayin could somebody just be happy for me?<end_line>
I really hate to say "I told you so"<end_line>
So I bite my tongue, but you know you know<end_line>
