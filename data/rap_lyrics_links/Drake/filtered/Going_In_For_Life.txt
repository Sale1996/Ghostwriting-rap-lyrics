I'on think they really ready for my wardrobe<end_line>
I show up rite before the store clothes<end_line>
And blow the feed from my last 4 shows<end_line>
I do 1 song & use 4 flows<end_line>
She use to be a christian before...<end_line>
But now all she wanna do is shop for Christian Dior clothes<end_line>
Like baby those are cute I adore those<end_line>
Me & the salesman build a reporso<end_line>
He understands tha fact that I'm spending all sure doe<end_line>
Cash only, transactions homie<end_line>
And please no receipts the feds like to explore those<end_line>
They can't audit if they dnt know I bought it<end_line>
I been doin this for yrs homie, thoroughly I thought it<end_line>
Thru, what it do? I am currently recorded on a track & made most of my<end_line>
currency's imported<end_line>
We're too late now, too legitimate to hit 'em with<end_line>
Lawsuits even if they're crimes that I did commit<end_line>
Repeat offender, Anita Baker<end_line>
playin' in the whip as they pull me over my sweet surrender<end_line>
I gotta jewish lawyer as my lead defender<end_line>
A mis kite as they say is a legal bender<end_line>
And ATF is present every legal memeber<end_line>
The coalition, is so officient<end_line>
You have to be invited or there's no admission<end_line>
We know tradition<end_line>
We spend money so dnt try to make Compete if you're in no position<end_line>
I wish you would listen<end_line>
I take you back to this trial<end_line>
Where I am about to be home again like New Edition<end_line>
My foot is solely fit for this shoe it fits in<end_line>
Use to record in a basement that rennie gru was pimpin<end_line>
When pops turned over the keys like a new ignition<end_line>
If Hov is Jordan, I guess I'm cool with pimpin'<end_line>
'til I met janette I wanna play a new position<end_line>
No team playin', no screen settin'<end_line>
Because I wanna win games, coach I'm through assistin'<end_line>
The take over, the break's over, NIGGA<end_line>
And I'm a keep killin' em until the day tht Drake's over<end_line>
The wait's over, the tape's coming<end_line>
They bullshittin' but I'm a comer w. great plumbing<end_line>
The human mentality's so eager to hate somethingg<end_line>
I try to play it off like it ain't jumpin'<end_line>
And it's the predicament that you found Drake in<end_line>
They collo that I just purchased is sound vacant<end_line>
'cause I have just been sittin' in this cell<end_line>
Thinkin' what I coulda done to make my first video ground breaking<end_line>
And whenever I'm flowing on the mic<end_line>
Aside from the d I'm throwin' in ya' wife<end_line>
I treat this one session as if it was my last<end_line>
And I pretend tomorrow is the day I'm going in for life...<end_line>
