I been movin calm, don't start no trouble with me<end_line>
Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me<end_line>
Don't pull up at 6 AM to cuddle with me<end_line>
You know how I like it when you lovin on me<end_line>
I don't wanna die for them to miss me<end_line>
Yes I see the things that they wishin on me<end_line>
Hope I got some brothers that outlive me<end_line>
They gon' tell the story, shit was different with me<end_line>
God's plan, God's plan<end_line>
I hold back, sometimes I won't<end_line>
I feel good, sometimes I don't<end_line>
I finessed down Weston Road<end_line>
Might go down as G-O-D<end_line>
I go hard on Southside G<end_line>
I make sure that northside eat<end_line>
And still<end_line>

She say, "Do you love me?" I tell her, "Only partly<end_line>
I only love my bed and my momma, I'm sorry"<end_line>
Fifty Dub, I even got it tatted on me<end_line>
81, they'll bring the crashers to the party<end_line>
And you know me<end_line>
Turn the O2 into the O3<end_line>
Dawg; without 40, Oli, there'd be no me<end_line>
Imagine if I never met the broskies<end_line>
God's plan, God's plan<end_line>
I can't do this on my own<end_line>
Someone watchin this shit close<end_line>
I've been me since Scarlett Road<end_line>
Might go down as G-O-D<end_line>
I go hard on Southside G<end_line>
I make sure that northside eat<end_line>
And still<end_line>
<verse_end>
