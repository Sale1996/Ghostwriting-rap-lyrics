I took some sense/cents and make a nickel of it<end_line>

With those lips that all that lipstick covers<end_line>
You're never too grown up to miss and hug her<end_line>
And girls count on me to be there like missin rubbers<end_line>
I'm on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of +Distant Lovers+<end_line>
This ain't the life that I'm used to<end_line>
Reintroduced to people I been introduced to<end_line>
Did you forget me? Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me<end_line>
in fear that I won't remember, I wish you could still accept me for me<end_line>
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad<end_line>
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners had<end_line>
I'm halfway across the world with dozens of bags<end_line>
Feelin like all four members of Color Me Badd<end_line>
In one nigga, amazin shit<end_line>

La familia, I been inducted and instructed<end_line>

Havin lunch and debatin Ferrari prices<end_line>
23 and goin through a mid-life crisis<end_line>
But trust me I still deliver like a midwife<end_line>
And no I'm not sayin I'm the nicest, I just live life like it<end_line>
Uhh, it take a certain type of man to teach<end_line>
To be far from hood but to understand the streets<end_line>
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech<end_line>
because I haven't hit the pinnacles I plan to reach<end_line>
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it<end_line>
Kisses all on her body she tells me live in the moment<end_line>
And baby, I never forget none of that<end_line>
Girl I told you I was comin back<end_line>
