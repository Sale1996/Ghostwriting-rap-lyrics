<verse_start>
This is really one of my dumbest flows ever<end_line>
I haven't slept in days, and me and my latest girl<end_line>
agreed to go our separate ways, so I'm single<end_line>
Thinking about what we had and missing you<end_line>
But I ain't Santa, I got something for these bad bitches too<end_line>
I mean paparazzi on me, trying not to get caught out<end_line>
They always seem to catch me with the women that I brought out<end_line>
Baby don't hold on too long cause that's how them stories start out<end_line>
And all those girls that played me eat your mother fucking heart out, it's Drizzy<end_line>
Always gone but never hard to find<end_line>
And since you can't escape me, do I ever cross your mind<end_line>
Because all this shit is new to me, I'm learning to behave<end_line>
And still spending every dollar they encourage me to save, but I'm good<end_line>
I know that niggas would kill for this lifestyle<end_line>
I'm looking forward to the memories of right now<end_line>
Never forgetting from where I came<end_line>
And no matter where I'm headed, I promise to stay the same<end_line>
<verse_end>
