<verse_start>
Somewhere between psychotic and iconic<end_line>
Somewhere between I want it and I got it<end_line>
Somewhere between I'm sober and I'm lifted<end_line>
Somewhere a mistress and commitment<end_line>
But I stay down, girl I always stay down<end_line>
Get down, have her lay down<end_line>
Promise to break everybody off before I break down<end_line>
Everyone just wait now<end_line>
So much on my plate now<end_line>
People I believed in they don't even show their face now<end_line>
What they got to say now?<end_line>
Nothing they can say now<end_line>
Nothing really changed but still they look at me away now<end_line>
What more can I say now?<end_line>
What more can I say now?<end_line>
You might feel like nothing was the same<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
And I hate that you don't think that I belong to ya<end_line>
Just too busy running shit to run home to ya<end_line>
You know that paper my passion<end_line>
Bittersweet celebrations, I know I can't change what happened<end_line>
I can't help it<end_line>
I can't help it<end_line>
I was young and I was selfish<end_line>
I made every woman feel like she was mine and no one else's<end_line>
And now you hate me<end_line>
Stop pretending, stop that fronting<end_line>
I can't take it<end_line>
Girl don't treat me like a stranger<end_line>
Girl you know I seen ya naked<end_line>
Girl you know that I remember, don't be a pretender<end_line>
Getting high at the condo, that's when it all comes together<end_line>
You know I stay reminiscing<end_line>
And makeup sex is tradition<end_line>
But you've been missing girl<end_line>
And you might feel like nothing was the same<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
This the life for me<end_line>
My mama told me this was right for me<end_line>
I got em worried, like make sure you save a slice for me<end_line>
I should have spoons, serve you up with a fork and knife for me<end_line>
Your actions make us doubt you<end_line>
Your lack of effort got me rapping different<end_line>
This the shit I wanna go out to<end_line>
Play this shit at my funeral if they catch me slippin<end_line>
Naked women swimming that's just how I'm living<end_line>
Donate a million to some children, that's just how I'm feeling<end_line>
A nigga filling up arenas, who the fuck can see us<end_line>
I had to Derrick Rose the knee up before I got the re-up<end_line>
Yours truly the boy<end_line>
I just build and build more<end_line>
Y'all niggas build and destroy<end_line>
You niggas party too much, man I just chill and record<end_line>
No filler, you feel it now if you ain't fill it before<end_line>
Yes Lord, this the shit I wanna go out to<end_line>
This the shit I wanna go out to<end_line>
<verse_end>
