I've asked about you and they told me things<end_line>
But my mind didn't change and I still the feel the same<end_line>
What's a life with no fun? please don't be so ashamed<end_line>
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know<end_line>
We know, they don't get you like I will<end_line>
My only wish is I die real<end_line>
Cause that truth hurts, and those lies heal<end_line>
And you can't sleep thinkin that he lies still<end_line>
So you cry still, tears all in the pillow case<end_line>
Big girls all get a little taste<end_line>
Pushin me away so I give her space<end_line>
Dealin with a heart that I didn't break<end_line>
I'll be there for you, I will care for you<end_line>
I keep thankin you, just don't know<end_line>
Try to run from that, say you're done with that<end_line>
On your face girl, it just don't show<end_line>
When you're ready, just say you're ready<end_line>
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy<end_line>
And the parties over, just don't forget me<end_line>
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow<end_line>
You won't ever have to worry<end_line>
You won't ever have to hide<end_line>
And you seen all my mistakes<end_line>
So look me in my eyes<end_line>

<verse_start>
It's my birthday, I get high if I want to<end_line>
Can't deny that I want you, but I lie if have to<end_line>
Cause you don't say you love me<end_line>
To your friends when they ask you<end_line>
Even though we both know that you do<end_line>
One time, been in love one time<end_line>
You and all your girls in the club one time<end_line>
All so convinced that you're followin your heart<end_line>
Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes<end_line>
We all have our nights though, don't be so ashamed<end_line>
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know<end_line>
We know, you hate being alone<end_line>
When you ain't the only one<end_line>
You hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one<end_line>
And you love your friends but somebody shoulda told you somethin' to save you<end_line>
Instead they said...<end_line>
<verse_end>
