<verse_start>
uh yea man, vo, back again like we never left huh<end_line>
yea man, I'm sending this out to any of my girls thats different man<end_line>
Anybody thats special<end_line>
you know I wanna be honest with you women so ima start off like this<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
uh look, I'm bold from the get go<end_line>
go by the title of Drake<end_line>
And treating me like the rest is a vital mistake<end_line>
I'm hopin that ain't nobody else as special as you<end_line>
When I say I've been disappointed I'm addressin a few<end_line>
I finesse then I groove<end_line>
While most of the 8 to 9's in my past<end_line>
now get a rating thats less than a 2<end_line>
Its true, I been talking to aleshia, keisha and nadia<end_line>
And shadia, had to throw peace signs to a lot of ya's<end_line>
payback, to the same chicks from way back<end_line>
never call, now they wanna be where I stays at<end_line>
now they got the new boy, I'm trying to move forward<end_line>
And pass me, classy, something like drew lord<end_line>
A new me, cool, see I never get around<end_line>
If I don't change now I don't think I'll ever settle down<end_line>
even if I gotta travel a bit<end_line>
I'll go around the world and back<end_line>
Cause I know that once I have it thats it and uh<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
A girl I can love that sees nothing wrong with getting used to me<end_line>
yea my name ain't change but I'm far from the man that I used to be<end_line>
Since a young dude the flow was nasty acidic<end_line>
ever since the demo dog<end_line>
And groupies are gettin brave<end_line>
now they ask me for<end_line>
rappers, I write em a Verse<end_line>
And ask me to spit it<end_line>
but I pay no mind though<end_line>
Cause they know I know<end_line>
hard as these niggas working man<end_line>
They wont sign so<end_line>
Drake and vo back<end_line>
I take it you know that<end_line>
you take it sitting down<end_line>
or you can take it to gold black<end_line>
And since Drake done took it from curls to waves<end_line>
Its been kind of like a whirlwind phase<end_line>
I mean I had my share of women<end_line>
now a nigga gettin girls for days<end_line>
With most of em its seemin like they world is staged<end_line>
but from georgia to bk and all around the world<end_line>
get your hands in the air if your avoiding the cliche<end_line>
If you've been hurt and you alone be steady<end_line>
These the same dudes from rewind, grown and ready, and uh<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
A girl I can love that sees nothing wrong with getting used to me<end_line>
yea my name ain't change but I'm far from the man that I used to be<end_line>
Look theres requirements to be an admirer<end_line>
Still the new version of fresh needa a nia or tyra<end_line>
So we can be jenny and swayze<end_line>
I told you I'm careful with my heart girl, many have played me<end_line>
or maybe its karma<end_line>
They say is a charmer<end_line>
halfway to a night so I stay in a armor<end_line>
I'm fire on the move<end_line>
A tire looking smooth<end_line>
I'm not perfect but I got a desire to improve<end_line>
I'm special<end_line>
Like kids in a graduating class<end_line>
having more trouble than others when addin basic math<end_line>
need you to be special like areba to cootmore<end_line>
double o, top secret agents with suits on<end_line>
Something so deep it da drown me<end_line>
Friends are some cool dudes<end_line>
I vouch for the people around me<end_line>
on your end its simple<end_line>
All you have to do<end_line>
Is give me no reason for other lovers after you and uh<end_line>
<verse_end>
