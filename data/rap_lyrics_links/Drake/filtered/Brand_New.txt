This here is on some truthful shit<end_line>
It seems like everything I do you are use to it!<end_line>
And I hate hearing stories about who you've been with<end_line>
Thats when I gotta hide what I'm feeling inside<end_line>
So you still think I'm confident and dumb<end_line>
Is this gonna last?<end_line>
Your up on a pedestal<end_line>
Are we moving too fast?<end_line>
Feels Like I'm in crazy competition with the past<end_line>
That's why I gotta ask<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
This here is something personal<end_line>
I highly doubt this feeling is reversible<end_line>
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know<end_line>
That you atempt to hide and put mistakes aside<end_line>
So I don't ever question you were dumb<end_line>
I can't even find the perfect brush<end_line>
So i can paint what's going through my mind<end_line>
Racing against myself but I'm a couple steps behind<end_line>
That's why I gotta ask<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Is anything I'm doing Brand New?<end_line>
Is everything I'm doing too late?<end_line>
Did he take your clothes off just like this?<end_line>
Did he give you loving just like this?<end_line>
Did you spend the night in his bed on the very first date?<end_line>
Tell me baby, am I too late?<end_line>
<verse_end>
