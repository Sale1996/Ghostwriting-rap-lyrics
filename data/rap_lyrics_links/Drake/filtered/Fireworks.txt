Money just changed everything, I wonder how life without it would go<end_line>
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow?<end_line>
Lookin down from the top and it's crowded below<end_line>
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago<end_line>
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant shit<end_line>
When I hear 'em talkin I just don't know what to make of it<end_line>
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracin it<end_line>
Doesn't come natural, bear with me it could take a bit<end_line>
Yeah, and my dreams are who I'm racin with<end_line>
But you could see I'm pacin it so that I'm always chasin it<end_line>
Wayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with<end_line>
I hope that my success never alters our relationship<end_line>
Yeah, this life is somethin I would die for<end_line>
+October's Own+ but it's lookin like July 4<end_line>
I just wish they'd let you try it first<end_line>
This time I'm really goin off, fireworks<end_line>

I'm just such a gentleman, you should give it up for me<end_line>
Look at how I'm placin all my napkins and my cutlery<end_line>
I could tell it wasn't love, I just thought you fuck with me<end_line>
Who coulda predicted Lucky Strike will have you stuck with me<end_line>
Damn, I kept my wits about me luckily<end_line>
What happened between us that night, it always seems to trouble me<end_line>
Now all of a sudden these gossip rags wanna cover me<end_line>
And you makin it seem like it happened that way because of me<end_line>
But I was curious<end_line>
And I'll never forget it baby, what an experience<end_line>
You coulda been the one but it wasn't that serious<end_line>
There was smoke in the air before, that was me clearin it<end_line>
That felt good, all in all I learned a lesson from it though<end_line>
You never see it comin, you just get to see it go<end_line>
Yeah, I shoulda looked up in the sky at first<end_line>
Now I could see it in her eyes, fireworks<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Everything the same but it feels different<end_line>
My dad called me up knowin that I still listen<end_line>
And he still got his foot out, guilt trippin<end_line>
It's been years though, I just learn to deal wit it<end_line>
For real, me and my Realtor we built up a better rapport<end_line>
Got my mother in a place with some better decor<end_line>
She searched the entire city, I let her explore<end_line>
And now she's sayin she more lonely than ever before<end_line>
How many of our parents' marriage has lasted?<end_line>
I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted<end_line>
I'm flyin back home for the heritage classic<end_line>
Searchin for that feelin, tell me where is the magic?<end_line>
Let's stay together 'til we're ghosts<end_line>
I wanna winess love, I never seen it close<end_line>
Yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first<end_line>
That's why I'm really goin off, fireworks<end_line>
