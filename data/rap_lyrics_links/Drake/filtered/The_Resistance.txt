Uhh, should I spend a weekend in Vegas?<end_line>
I'm livin inside a moment, not takin pictures to save it<end_line>
I mean how could I forget, my memories never faded<end_line>
I can't relate to these haters, my enemies never made it<end_line>
I am, still here with who I started with<end_line>
The game needed life, I put my heart in it<end_line>
I blew myself up, I'm on some martyr shit<end_line>
Carried the weight for my city like a cargo ship<end_line>
Uhh, I'm 23 with a money tree<end_line>
Growin more too, I just planted a hundred seeds<end_line>
It's ironic cause my mother was a florist<end_line>
and that's how she met my pops and now my garden is enormous<end_line>
It's happened in Penny Lane, just like you said<end_line>
I avoided the Coke game and went with Sprite instead<end_line>
Uh-uhhh, that's word to the millions that they puttin up<end_line>
I'm tryin to do better than good enough<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Uhh, am I wrong for makin light of my situation? Clap on<end_line>
When 40 got some shit for me to snap on<end_line>
Now that I'm on I don't really wanna worry 'bout gettin back on<end_line>
I'm just tryin to stay on, get my fuckin buffet on<end_line>
I heard they just moved my grandmother to a nursin home<end_line>
And I'll be actin like I don't know how to work a phone<end_line>
But hit redial, you'll see that I just called<end_line>
some chick I met at the mall that I barely know at all<end_line>
And, plus this woman that I messed with unprotected<end_line>
Textin sayin she wish she woulda kept it<end_line>
The one that I'm layin next to just looked over and read it<end_line>
Man I couldn't tell you where the fuck my head is, I'm holdin on by a thread it's<end_line>
like I'm high right now, the guy right now<end_line>
And you could tell by lookin in my eyes right now<end_line>
That nothin really comes as a surprise right now<end_line>
Cause we just havin the time of our lives right now<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Well alright, uhh<end_line>
I live by some advices girl, Lisa told me<end_line>
The other day Lisa told me that she miss the old me<end_line>
Uh, which made me question when I went missin<end_line>
And when I start treatin my friends different<end_line>
Maybe it was the fast-paced switch-up<end_line>
or the two guns in my face durin the stick-up<end_line>
Maybe cause a girl I thought I trusted was who set the whole shit up<end_line>
or the fact I haven't seen 'em since they locked Big Rich up<end_line>
I know, but same time I'm quick to forget<end_line>
I'm 'bout to roll me up a blunt with my list of regrets<end_line>
Burn it all, burn it all, I'm startin it fresh<end_line>
Cause half the time I got it right I probably guessed<end_line>
Did I just trade free time for camera time?<end_line>
Will I blow all of this money baby, Hammer Time?<end_line>
Yeah.. I just need some closure<end_line>
Ain't no turnin back for me, I'm in it 'til it's over<end_line>
<verse_end>
