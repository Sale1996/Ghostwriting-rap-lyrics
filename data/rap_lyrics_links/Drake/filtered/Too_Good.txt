I don't know how to talk to you<end_line>
I don't know how to ask you if you're okay<end_line>
My friends always feel the need to tell me things<end_line>
Seems like they're just happier than us these days<end_line>
Yeah, these days I don't know how to talk to you<end_line>
I don't know how to be there when you need me<end_line>
It feels like the only time you see me<end_line>
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Yeah, and last night I think I lost my patience<end_line>
Last night I got high as the expectations<end_line>
Last night, I came to a realization<end_line>
And I hope you can take it<end_line>
I hope you can take it<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I'm too good to you<end_line>
I'm way too good to you<end_line>
You take my love for granted<end_line>
I just don't understand it<end_line>
No, I'm too good to you<end_line>
I'm way too good to you<end_line>
You take my love for granted<end_line>
I just don't understand it<end_line>

<verse_start>
Years go by too fast<end_line>
I can't keep track<end_line>
How long did we last?<end_line>
I feel bad for asking<end_line>
It can't end like this<end_line>
We gotta take time with this<end_line>
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it<end_line>
Let me see if this is something I can fix<end_line>
You got somebody other than me<end_line>
Don't play the victim when you're with me<end_line>
Free time is costing me more than it seems<end_line>
Sacrificing things<end_line>
And I wanna tell you my intentions<end_line>
I wanna do the things that I mention<end_line>
I wanna benefit from the friendship<end_line>
I wanna get the late night message from you, from you<end_line>
I put my hands around you<end_line>
Gotta get a handle on you<end_line>
Gotta get a handle on the fact that...<end_line>

You take my love for granted<end_line>

No, I'm too good to you<end_line>
I'm way too good to you<end_line>
You take my love for granted<end_line>
I just don't understand it<end_line>
