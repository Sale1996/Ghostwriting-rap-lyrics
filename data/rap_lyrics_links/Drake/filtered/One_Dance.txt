<verse_start>
Grips on your waist<end_line>
Front way, back way<end_line>
You know that I don't play<end_line>
Streets not safe<end_line>
But I never run away<end_line>
Even when I'm away<end_line>
Oti, oti, there's never much love when we go, oti<end_line>
I pray to make it back in one piece<end_line>
I pray, I pray<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Strength and guidance<end_line>
All that I'm wishing for my friends<end_line>
Nobody makes it from my ends<end_line>
I had to bust up the silence<end_line>
You know you gotta stick by me<end_line>
Soon as you see the text, reply me<end_line>
I don't wanna spend time fighting<end_line>
We've got no time<end_line>
<verse_end>
