This the record that my backpack underground fans get to get to skippin<end_line>
Back back, Southern town fans get to tippin<end_line>
Chasin fat stacks, runnin down grands and submission<end_line>
I don't back track, e'ry single sound for me different<end_line>
I don't own no ice, just got clean rap<end_line>
I don't ever two step, I just rock, lean, snap<end_line>
We can take it out to Houston where the rides all glossed up<end_line>
Anybody I'm standin besides all bossed up<end_line>
Burgular monitor they say I'm servin them rhymers<end_line>
And me and Nickel F go together like burgers and diners, yes<end_line>
I'm like a waiter if you somethin like a hater<end_line>
with trays in both hands, place an order I can cater<end_line>
Uhh - I got the diamonds in my teeth flow<end_line>
Memphis is the reason that my rhyming and my speech slow<end_line>
Peep though, when I get fed up, it's sped up<end_line>
Ridin through the streets just reclinin in my seat yo<end_line>
Uhh - them city lights is lookin brighter<end_line>
It's 3 AM in the mornin and the pen is like a lighter<end_line>
I'm just a writer flamin pages of a notebook<end_line>
Mah Rachel McAdams get at 'em when I ignite her<end_line>
Yup! Soon as a couple plan a trip<end_line>
You smell gasoline I've been burnin all up and down the strip<end_line>
Strip I done said it, I give you the unleaded<end_line>
Just tempt me if you think it's empty, come get it<end_line>

Break it down like you workin for your tuition at Howard<end_line>
Mama get it how you live, that thang that you workin is power<end_line>
Tryin to be generous, so honey here's a tip<end_line>
Now-a-days it's gettin cheaper to put 20's on the whip<end_line>
So if you a opportunist look for 20's in the clip<end_line>
And if you find 'em attractive and funny, that's when you dip, dip<end_line>
And it's a trip, my city broke into sections<end_line>
Up North I got me a couple of troubles, couple connections<end_line>
And it's nothin that I created on purpose<end_line>
There's people that gotta problem but they scared to let it surface, uh<end_line>
Ya boy say this, that, and the third to 'em<end_line>
See me out and they never utter a word to 'em<end_line>
Expect me not to draw a card from the deck<end_line>
Anybody in my city goin hard I respect, but<end_line>
You gotta debt and you choose not to pay that<end_line>
I'a hop ya fence, come into your yard and collect, lect uh<end_line>
It ain't a problem of concern bruh<end_line>
I always end up with exactly what I earn bruh<end_line>
This ain't last year, money like a cashier<end_line>
So have your receipt if you tryna make a return bruh<end_line>
Yessir, I live in a city where a lot of people don't get shine, shine<end_line>
And, I be on by the fence as soon as anybody steppin out of line, line<end_line>
And I got way too much love, for the city I can never get too much of<end_line>
And if anybody hatin on me, I deport 'em, the city is mine boy<end_line>
