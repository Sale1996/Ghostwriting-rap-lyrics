These days, I'm letting God handle all things above me<end_line>
The things I can't change are the reasons you love me<end_line>
Listen you can hear them calling my name<end_line>
I'm all over the place, I can't sit in one place<end_line>
I'm not ashamed at all<end_line>
Still findin' myself, let alone a soulmate, I'm just sayin'<end_line>
Feel like we one and the same, our relationship changed<end_line>
That or it never existed<end_line>
Whenever they say somethin' bout us, you listen<end_line>
But fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline<end_line>
That's cuttin' all into my time with you<end_line>
Fuck what they talkin' about on your timeline<end_line>
That's cuttin' all into my time with you<end_line>

She said you're my everything<end_line>
I love you through everything<end_line>
I done did everything to her<end_line>
She forgave me for everything, this a forever thing<end_line>
Hate that I treated like it's a whatever thing<end_line>
Trust me girl, this shit is everything to me<end_line>
She from the Jungle, she from the Jungle<end_line>
I take somebody elses car, drive it undercover<end_line>
This shit is everything to me, this shit is everything<end_line>
Don't know where we stand, I used to hit you bout everything<end_line>
Are we still good? Are we still good?<end_line>
Are we still good? Are we still good?<end_line>
If I need to talk are you around?<end_line>
Are you down for the cause?<end_line>
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?<end_line>
Are you down for the cause?<end_line>
Are you down? Are you down? Are you down?<end_line>
Are you down for the cause?<end_line>
You still down? You still down? You still down?<end_line>

These days these new girls got me nervous<end_line>
They go to school and do bottle service<end_line>
They can't decide, they keep switching majors<end_line>
Being indecisive makes me anxious<end_line>
Call your number and it's out of service<end_line>
Who can I call for your information?<end_line>
What am I supposed to do after we done doing everything we do<end_line>
Who is your replacement?<end_line>
Are we still good? Are we still good?<end_line>
Are we still good? Are we still good?<end_line>
