Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings<end_line>
Head to works, I get some breakfast 'cause, still a nigga yawning<end_line>
From the night before, at the club I was up I'm tryna live<end_line>
Only twenty two my nig, 'bout to be twenty three ya dig?<end_line>
Time don't wait for none of us that's why I gotta chase my dreams<end_line>
Make my momma proud so she can show off all her pearly teeth<end_line>
And be half the man my dad was, I thank God he was in my life<end_line>
I realize how many<end_line>
Either I, need to make this music work or move from the Earth<end_line>
I'm preachin' fire, need a choir, 'bout to take you all to church<end_line>
My congregation bombed the nation with this HIP HOP<end_line>
We in the race to fame, blowin' pass the PIT STOPS<end_line>
I heard the prize was some chicks and a WRIST WATCH<end_line>
And all you gotta do is go to jail or GET SHOT<end_line>
Yeah Nick cop but he ain't never get popped<end_line>
How we gonna get pop fans? Give 'em a quick shot<end_line>
Now I get ya chick hot with my wrist watch<end_line>
Yeah shorty drip drop when it tick tock<end_line>
It's kinda sick huh? Ay Jay, put it in the heart of Pickering<end_line>
And tell them niggas this is NICK'S SPOT<end_line>

Ayo I stay up every evening, write that shit that they believe in<end_line>
DJs run it, they approach me, and it's praise I be receiving<end_line>
From the night befo', at the club, fake I.D. my record spins<end_line>
Got me dancin' right outside since these niggas won't let me in<end_line>
Well guess again, slip around the back and get it crackin'<end_line>
And all the bottles wrapped in cellophane<end_line>
Hundred grand, Nickle F, that nigga's the next to win<end_line>
Virgina go rep for him, and Memphis represent for me<end_line>
To the tenth 10 degree, Tennekey, T Dot to the country ya'll<end_line>
Orangemen and White Haven, an back up north to Montreal<end_line>
I ain't ashamed, my city ain't on the map<end_line>
Light that fire, realize they ain't born to rap<end_line>
Pass the torch and sell they soul<end_line>
Maybe they can bring they career back<end_line>
But these niggas right here ain't tryna hear that<end_line>
Cause I'm on set, make it work, break even on 9 to 5's<end_line>
Cigarettes and lotto tickets, tryna keep that grind alive<end_line>
All my uncles, they hit the casino when they get they check<end_line>
My cousins, they paint theyto get respect<end_line>
This can't be life, dominoes anddro and twenty stacks<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I'm tryna get that cash, then watch how tall it grows<end_line>
Soon as we get the ass, we start callin' 'em hos<end_line>
The concept you don't grasp, I'm guessin' you too old<end_line>
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM<end_line>
<verse_end>
