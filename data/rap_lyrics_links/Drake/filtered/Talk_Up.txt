Ten of us, we movin as one<end_line>
I'm so proud of who I've become<end_line>
You might think I've taken some lumps<end_line>
... Only if we talkin 'bout sums<end_line>
Intentions are pure, they cannot tell me relax<end_line>
My mentions are jokes, but they never give me the facts<end_line>
This isn't that, can't be ignorin the stats<end_line>
Based off of that, they gotta run me the max<end_line>
They gotta run me the max, they gotta double the racks<end_line>
They had it set up for real, but they didn't come with the slaps<end_line>
When I heard the shit I was skippin through that<end_line>
... If I get it trippin it's no comin back<end_line>
I don't understand, these niggaz gotta adapt<end_line>
You know where I'm at, I put the 6 on the map<end_line>
Your shorty was bent, she wanted to vent, I promise it fell in my lap<end_line>
My money is young, my problems are old, I promise I'm bridgin the gap<end_line>
