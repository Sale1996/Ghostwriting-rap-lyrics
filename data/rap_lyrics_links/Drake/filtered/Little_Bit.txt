But how we move from A to B, it can't be up to me<end_line>
'Cause you don't know, who I was before you<end_line>
And basically to see a change in me<end_line>
I'd be losing, so I just ignore you, yeah...<end_line>
Ohhh-ohh-ohhh<end_line>
But you're on my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind<end_line>
Ohhh-ohh-ohhh<end_line>

<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Ohh-ohh, oh<end_line>
I hope they never find out...<end_line>
What they already know, know... know<end_line>

We'll have to let it go, go... go<end_line>
So we don't confirm the fling<end_line>

Both hearts beat like a metronome<end_line>
Both +*NSYNC+ like a Justin song<end_line>
Feels so right but it's just, so wrong<end_line>
I wonder where my world 'bout<end_line>
When niggas that I know tryna take my girl out<end_line>

She just jealous 'cause you always get approached more<end_line>
Oh, well, tell her fall back <end_line>
Caught up in some mo' shit, tell her call back<end_line>
Tell her get a man that ain't cheatin on her ass<end_line>
Wit a girl that I know, yeah tell her all, that, that<end_line>
And as for you, I think I know you're the one<end_line>
The closest I've come, I'm probably a...<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Ohh-ohh, oh...<end_line>
Ohh-ohh, oh...<end_line>
