Yeah, my side girl got a 5S with the screen cracked<end_line>
Still hit me back right away, better not never hesitate<end_line>
Don't come around thinkin' you gettin' saved<end_line>
Tryna show the dogs brighter days<end_line>
Got a torch, tryna light the way<end_line>
Bitin' everybody, which is ironic<end_line>
cause your next album probably won't ever see the light of day<end_line>
Have fans but you let 'em down<end_line>
But I guess that's how you niggas gettin' down<end_line>
I'm so high up I'm like, "How is niggas really gettin' down?"<end_line>
I could never have a kid, then be out here still kiddin' around<end_line>
Boys playin' around, where you really wanna take it now?<end_line>
I got a hundred fifty thousand dollars for an after party<end_line>
And I gave it to the killas just to break it down<end_line>
Bring us up, I never take us down<end_line>
But if you bring me up, then they might take you down<end_line>
Fake fuck with me back then<end_line>
But it's gettin' hard for you to fake it now<end_line>
Fuck bein' rich when I'm forty, man, I'm tryna make it now<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Hell nah<end_line>
Never let these niggas ride your wave<end_line>
Nope, no way, nah<end_line>
Never let these niggas ride your wave<end_line>
Nope, no way, nah<end_line>
Park the Benz just to ride the Wraith<end_line>
Skrrt, skrrt<end_line>
Ten million dollars, gotta hide the safe<end_line>
