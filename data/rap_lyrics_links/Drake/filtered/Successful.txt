Aw yeah, Trey I fuckin' feel ya<end_line>
They be starin' at the money like it's unfamiliar<end_line>
I get it, I live it, to me there's nothing realer<end_line>
Just enough to solve your problems, too much'll kill ya<end_line>
And when I leave I always come right back here<end_line>
The young spitter that everybody in rap fear<end_line>
Alot of ya'll are still sounding like last year<end_line>
The game need change and I'm the motherfuckin' cashier<end_line>
Nickels for my thoughts, dimes in my bed<end_line>
Quarters of the kush shave the lines in my head<end_line>
Take my verses too serious, you'll hate me<end_line>
Cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture, no HD<end_line>
Yeah, I want it all, that's why I strive for it<end_line>
Diss me, you'll never hear a reply for it<end_line>
Any award show or party, I get fly for it<end_line>
But I know that it's coming, I just hope that I'm alive for it<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Yeah, I want things to go my way<end_line>
But as of late, alot of shit been going sideways<end_line>
And my mother try to run away from home<end_line>
But I left something in the car and so I caught her in the driveway<end_line>
And she cried to me, so I cried too<end_line>
And my stomach was soaking wet, she only 5'2"<end_line>
And 48 hours all before I showed up<end_line>
And brought a thousand dollars worth of drinks and got poored up<end_line>
Damn, my reality just set in<end_line>
And even when the pantoms leased, them hoes wanna get in<end_line>
I do alot of things hoping I never have to fit in<end_line>
So try to keep up with my progress, it's like a dead-end<end_line>
My girl love me, but fuck it my heart beats slow<end_line>
And right now the tour bus is looking like a freak show<end_line>
And life change for us every single week so<end_line>
it's good, but I know this ain't the peak though cause I want the<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Uh, why is words from a decent man<end_line>
Back when I was trying to put a ring on Alicia hand<end_line>
This lost boy got fly without Peter Pan<end_line>
And my delivery has got me buzzing like the Pizza Man<end_line>
In-person I am everything and more<end_line>
I'm everywhere these other niggas never been before<end_line>
But inside I'm treading water, steady trying to swim to shore<end_line>
I'm on a shopping spree to get whatever is in store<end_line>
Yeah, just call me "Shopping Bag Drizzy"<end_line>
Or call me "Mr. Damn, he ain't coppin' that, is he?"<end_line>
And fans that he freshmen, it's about to get iffy<end_line>
While this young'n that you doubted is about to get busy<end_line>
I'ma kill it, I promise, that's how I know ya mad<end_line>
I've always treated my city like some shoulder pads<end_line>
The big homie, use a flash if you must<end_line>
And I swear I ain't asking for much, all I want is the<end_line>
<verse_end>
