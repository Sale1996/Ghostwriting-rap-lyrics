Your boy all glowed up<end_line>
Every time we touch down, bet it go up<end_line>
'Member doin' shows, ain't nobody show up<end_line>
Pour your heart out, ain't nobody show love<end_line>
They used to laugh when my whip was on the tow truck<end_line>
'Til me and bein' broke finally broke up<end_line>
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow<end_line>
Time to shake the dice, time to change the li-I-ight<end_line>
No more 9 to 5, autopilot dri-I-I've<end_line>
Used to work the fries, now we supersi-I-ize<end_line>
We go suit and tie, we gon' touch the sky-y-y<end_line>
We so certified, we so certifi-I-ied<end_line>
Fuck you haters still, that's an F-Y-I-I-I<end_line>
They gon' bang this here all summerti-I-ime<end_line>
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Watch out-why, nigga?<end_line>
Cops out<end_line>
It's all love when I ride top down<end_line>
Top down<end_line>
Started from the bottom, now we here now<end_line>
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow<end_line>
We about to get the whole nine<end_line>
The whole nine, we just landed on a gold mine<end_line>
We the new Abu Dhabi, this is our time<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow<end_line>
I just take the dreams I've been sold<end_line>
And sell 'em for more, you already know<end_line>
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Watch out for me, I'm about to glow<end_line>
I still have my guard up<end_line>
Blame this thing I'm part of<end_line>
Tryin' to avoid more confrontation<end_line>
I just gotta try harder<end_line>
Takin' the time to clear my mind<end_line>
'Cause soon as I'm able to let that go<end_line>
<verse_end>
