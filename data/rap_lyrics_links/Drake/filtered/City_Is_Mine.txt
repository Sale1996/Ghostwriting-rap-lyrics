This the record that my backpack underground fans get to get to skippin<end_line>
Back back, Southern town fans get to tippin<end_line>
Chasin fat stacks, runnin down grands and submission<end_line>
I don't back track, every single sound for me different<end_line>
I don't own no ice, just got clean rap<end_line>
Don't ever two step, I just rock, lean, snap<end_line>
We could take it out to Houston where the rides all glossed up<end_line>
Anybody I'm standin beside's all bossed up<end_line>
Burgularthey say I'm servin them rhymers<end_line>
And me and Nickel F go together like burgers and diners, yes<end_line>
I'm like a waiter and you something like a hater<end_line>
With trays in both hands, place an order I can cater uh<end_line>
I got the diamonds in my teeth flow<end_line>
Memphis is the reason that my rhyming and my *chopped voice* speech slow<end_line>
Peep though, I only got pity for you lames<end_line>
Sitting pretty in the game, in the city that I claim<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Break it down like you working for your tuition at Howard<end_line>
Mama, get it how you live, that thang that you working is power<end_line>
Tryna be generous, so honey here's a tip<end_line>
Now-a-days it's gettin cheaper to put 20's on the whip<end_line>
So if you a opportunist look for 20's in the clip<end_line>
And if you find 'em attractive and funny, that's when you dip, dip<end_line>
And it's a trip, my city broke into sections<end_line>
Up North I got me a couple of troubles, couple connections<end_line>
And it's nothing that I created on purpose, there's people that gotta problem<end_line>
But they scared to let it surface, uh<end_line>
Ya boy say this, that, and the third to 'em<end_line>
See me out and they never utter a word to 'em<end_line>
Expect me not to draw a card from the deck<end_line>
Anybody in my city going hard I respect but,<end_line>
You gotta debt and you choose not to pay that<end_line>
Imma hop ya fence, come into your yard and collect, lect uh<end_line>
It ain't a problem of concern bruh, I always end up with exactly what I earn bruh<end_line>
This ain't last year, money like a cashier, so hand your receipt if you tryna make a return bruh<end_line>
Yessir, I live in a city where a lot of people don't get shine, shine<end_line>
And, I be on by the fence as soon as anybody stepping out of line, line<end_line>
And I got way too much love, for the city I can never get too much of<end_line>
And if anybody hatin on me, I deport 'em, the city is mine boy<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Break it down, break it break it down<end_line>
Break it down, break it break it down<end_line>
Break it down, break it break it down<end_line>
Break it down, break it break it down<end_line>
Break it down<end_line>
