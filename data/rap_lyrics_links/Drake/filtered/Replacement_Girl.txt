I was born up top but was raised at the bottom of the map<end_line>
Where the girls all thick and the hottest niggas rap<end_line>

I took my lifestyle from mediocre to good and now I say it's sittin at amazing'<end_line>
Girls tryin sell a whole lobby of us <end_line>
Hear em all screamin then it's probably is<end_line>
But I can't blame females, females can't really ignore something this obvious<end_line>
What you really expect when I strut through town<end_line>
Two or three days I shut you down<end_line>
Chilin wit the homie Trey Songz<end_line>
You call him the prince he rep two up two down<end_line>
Anyone I know get used to me<end_line>
Im far from the man that I used to be <end_line>
I don't ever really kick game<end_line>
I know you find it impressing whenever you introduced to me<end_line>
'Cause I'm a good dude who take pride in that<end_line>
Need good lovin' I'm providing that<end_line>
Understand that I'm worldwide<end_line>
You get who you want it wherever you be residing at<end_line>

To the UK<end_line>
From Spain back out to Texas<end_line>

'Cause I'm dripped up and I'm drapped out<end_line>
And I'm lean back<end_line>
Looking for a woman that I should wife<end_line>

Sunshine in that heat stroke<end_line>
And them fur hoods in that deep snow<end_line>
We have breakfast in the bedroom<end_line>
Break bread downstairs in the basement<end_line>
