<verse_start>
Yeah, uh, after hours of Il Mulino<end_line>
Or Sotto Sotto, just talking women and vino<end_line>
The contract like '91 Dan Marino<end_line>
I swear this got Michael Rapinos boostin' my ego<end_line>
Overly focused, it's far from the time to rest now<end_line>
Debates growing 'bout who they think is the best now<end_line>
Took a while, got the jokers out of the deck now<end_line>
I'm holdin' all the cards and niggas wanna play chess now<end_line>
I hear you talkin', say it twice so I know you meant it<end_line>
Fuck it, I don't even tint it, they should know who's in it<end_line>
I'm authentic, real name, no gimmicks<end_line>
No game, no scrimmage, I ain't playin' with you niggas at all<end_line>
My classmates, they went on to be chartered accountants<end_line>
or work with their parents; but thinking back on how they treated me<end_line>
My high school reunion might be worth an appearance<end_line>
Make everybody have to go through security clearance<end_line>
Tables turn, bridges burn, you live and learn<end_line>
With the ink/Inc I could +Murder+, word to my nigga Irv<end_line>
Yeah, I swear shit just started clickin' dawg<end_line>
You know it's real when you are who you think you are<end_line>
