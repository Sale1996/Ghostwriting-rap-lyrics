I don't care what society thinks. They're nothing anyway<end_line>
They're no better than me. Out there you just have to fit<end_line>
into a pattern that somebody's already laid out for you<end_line>
Life we live, you have to set your own patterns<end_line>
your own ideals. You have to handle the whole job yourself.<end_line>

<verse_start>
No snow tires, the rain slip-slide like Trick Daddy and Trina<end_line>
Oli North pull in, like, 10 million a season<end_line>
Queen Street visions that nobody believed in<end_line>
If we not on the charts, my XO niggas eatin'<end_line>
Fifty-two consecutive weekends, shout out to Weeknd<end_line>
The city gets stronger when everybody is speakin'<end_line>
Not when everybody out here beefin'<end_line>
We got it, now we just gotta keep it<end_line>
America's most wanted, man, I'm still on the run<end_line>
All these number ones and we still not the ones<end_line>
No hard feelings, but I'll still get you spun<end_line>
Went and got diplomas, and we still goin' dumb<end_line>
Please never label niggas who lay down for a livin'<end_line>
My competition, it's beyond offensive<end_line>
I'm in it for the glory, not the honor mention<end_line>
Not tryna be fourth and inches, I'm tryna go the distance<end_line>
Yeah, distance, I'm on a different mission<end_line>
This the remix to "Ignition," hot and fresh out the kitchen<end_line>
How you forget to fill up with gas on the road to riches?<end_line>
Too overly ambitious, too late to fix it<end_line>
Too late for condolences when it's over with<end_line>
I need to start sayin' shit when I notice it<end_line>
Be open with people I need some closure with<end_line>
Be honest with myself and take ownership<end_line>
Opinions started to burn when tables started to turn<end_line>
I really used to feel like they loved a nigga at first<end_line>
Excitin' times, revitalized<end_line>
Trust this little light of mine is gonna shine positively<end_line>
I'm just takin' what God will give me<end_line>
Grateful like Jerry, Bob and Mickey<end_line>
Better attitude, we'll see where it gets me<end_line>
I know catchin' flies with honey is still sticky<end_line>
I wrote the book on world-class finesses<end_line>
And tasteful gestures and makin' efforts<end_line>
And never placin' second<end_line>
And even better knowin' you're first but then takin' second<end_line>
Inspirin' and never takin' credit<end_line>
I know I deserve more, I just never said it<end_line>
Two middle fingers as I make a exit, yeah<end_line>

Did I lose you?<end_line>
Did I? Did I?<end_line>
Did I lose you?<end_line>
Did I? Did I?<end_line>
Did I lose you?<end_line>

<verse_start>
Winnin' is problematic<end_line>
People like you more when you workin' towards somethin'<end_line>
Not when you have it<end_line>
Way less support from my peers<end_line>
In recent years as I get established<end_line>
Unforgivin' times, but fuck it, I manage<end_line>
Why is my struggle different than others'?<end_line>
Only child that's takin' care of his mother<end_line>
As health worsens and bills double<end_line>
That's not respectable all of a sudden?<end_line>
I don't get a pat on the back for the come up?<end_line>
What do you see when you see me?<end_line>
When did all the things I mean<end_line>
From the bottom of my heart start to lose meaning?<end_line>
Maybe I share it with too many people<end_line>
Back then it used to just feel like our secret<end_line>
Back when I would write<end_line>
And not think about how they receive it<end_line>
I be tryna manifest the things I needed<end_line>
And look, now, I mean, it's hard to believe it even for me<end_line>
But you're mindful of it all when your mind full of it all<end_line>
How they go from not wantin' me at all<end_line>
To wantin' to see me lose it all?<end_line>
Things get dark, but my aura just starts glowin'<end_line>
I'm overcome with emotions<end_line>
Ones I can't access when I'm stoned sober<end_line>
Jealous ones still envy and niggas turn king cobra<end_line>
I could only speak what I know of<end_line>
Man, we wrote the book on calculated thinkin'<end_line>
And icy Heineken drinkin', and rival neighborhoods linkin'<end_line>
And puttin' your trust in someone<end_line>
With the risk of financially sinkin'<end_line>
All you did was write the book on garbage-ass Rollies<end_line>
Ego strokin', picture postin'<end_line>
Claimin' that you'd do it for motivational purposes only<end_line>
But you just had to show me<end_line>
See, I know, 'cause I study you closely<end_line>
I know when someone lyin'<end_line>
I notice people standin' for nothin' and gettin' tired<end_line>
I know what we're both thinkin' even when you're quiet<end_line>
Sometimes I gotta just make sure that I didn't lose you<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Did I? Did I?<end_line>
Did I lose you?<end_line>
Did I? Did I?<end_line>
Did I lose you?<end_line>
