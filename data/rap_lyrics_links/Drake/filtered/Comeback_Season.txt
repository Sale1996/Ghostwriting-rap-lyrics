<verse_start>
I got ice all over my windshield<end_line>
I can tell it's gon' be a cold winter<end_line>
I hit the defrost <end_line>
I never turn the heat off<end_line>
And still I'm so chilli willy snowflake<end_line>
These silly billies really feel to act as if they know Drake<end_line>
Always gossipin' callin' and textin'<end_line>
Magneto niggas tryna bring down ex-men/ X-men<end_line>
Tellin' my ex-girl tryna ex-plain<end_line>
How I am no good so go with the next man<end_line>
But dog<end_line>
You don't know me <end_line>
You don't know us<end_line>
We go by the name of A-T-F<end_line>
And any previous affiliation<end_line>
They know to hold they tongue and I spare 'em humiliation<end_line>
I know you in and out <end_line>
Nigga I am not playin'<end_line>
Just fall back keep on Escape'in and Alize'in<end_line>
And stop tryna act like you like me and my team<end_line>
Not us so you knock us<end_line>
That's precisely what I mean<end_line>
And dog <end_line>
It's forever clear<end_line>
My money evergreen<end_line>
My presence required in places you have never been<end_line>
It's all in a day's work that's what I am on<end_line>
NBC, MTV, Viacom<end_line>
And who's Continental GT is outside<end_line>
Showin' them how monumental he be?<end_line>
One wheel one the curb <end_line>
Ticket on the dash<end_line>
It's like e'ry fuckin' summer I just switch it on they ass<end_line>
And maaan I'm a commodity<end_line>
None of them as hot as me<end_line>
The industry standard <end_line>
So I am what they gotta be<end_line>
'Cause Drake's syllables is like Jake Gyllenhaal<end_line>
Can't help it<end_line>
I been brainwashed to kill 'em all<end_line>
I think I should pass my own amendment<end_line>
You frontin' with glass all in your pen-dant<end_line>
You ain't livin' rapper you never have been<end_line>
You a has-been a gas station attendant<end_line>
Your man is a turkey you wit' a liar<end_line>
I'm clearin' the air I'm a humidifier<end_line>
I'm spittin' fire <end_line>
And gettin' flyer<end_line>
And what you plannin' for this summer I did it prior<end_line>
I've shattered shows <end_line>
And tattered clothes<end_line>
Met status quos<end_line>
This is the south and I am present when it matters most<end_line>
The startin's hot but pay attention to my latter flows<end_line>
Givin' brain ain't bad girl don't be that opposed<end_line>
I flatter hoes<end_line>
And drink Dom<end_line>
They always ask me "Is that a rose?"<end_line>
You mean ros√©?<end_line>
Why yes it is<end_line>
I stopped trying years ago this is effortless<end_line>
I'm in your house got the key to your home<end_line>
I am Jeopardy asked Wikipedia known<end_line>
I am A.A. driven and Expedia flown<end_line>
So stop jackin' my style<end_line>
Your in need of ya own, man<end_line>
<verse_end>
