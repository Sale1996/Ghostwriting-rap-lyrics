Your heart is hard to carry after dark<end_line>
You're to blame for what we could have been<end_line>
'Cause look at what we are<end_line>
Your friends are scared to tell you you're in too far<end_line>
Funny that it's always been all about you from the start<end_line>
I met someone new last night and we kicked it<end_line>
And I'm going back there tonight<end_line>
And you know what's on my mind, this time<end_line>
Going back there tonight<end_line>
And you know what's on my mind<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Out of body<end_line>
That's just how I feel when I'm around you, shawty<end_line>
Last night we didn't say it<end_line>
But girl, we both thought it<end_line>
Why second guess? I should have stayed<end_line>
You say the word, I'm on the way<end_line>
This shit feels like teenage fever<end_line>
I'm not scared of it, she ain't either<end_line>
Why second guess? I should have stayed<end_line>
'Cause you know what's on my mind tonight<end_line>
<verse_end>
