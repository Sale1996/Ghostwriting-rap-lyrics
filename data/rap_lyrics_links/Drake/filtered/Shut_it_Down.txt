These girls ain't got nothing on you<end_line>
Uhh, say baby I had to mention<end_line>
That if you were a star you'd be the one I'm searching for<end_line>
All the girls they got attention<end_line>
But I just always feel like there in need of something you got<end_line>
It's obvious you're pretty<end_line>
Heard that your a student working weekends in the city<end_line>
Trying to take you out girl, hope your not too busy<end_line>
And if there's nothing wrong, got this little song<end_line>
for you to get ready to<end_line>
Put those fucking heels on and work it girl<end_line>
Let that mirror show you what your doing<end_line>
Put that fucking dress on and work it kind of vicious<end_line>
like somebody's taking pictures<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
We shut it down down down<end_line>
They know we shut it down down down<end_line>
You're the baddest girl around, round round<end_line>
They know this, they know this<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Shooting Stars all around her, fire, comets<end_line>
I could bring her through and shut them down, Onyx<end_line>
No, you're not imagining, they're looking at you long stares<end_line>
Even though she's standing out she looks like she belongs here<end_line>
You feel the hours pass, until you find somethin'<end_line>
I feel like when she moves Â– the time doesn't<end_line>
Yeah, baby you finer than your fine cousin, and your cousin fine<end_line>
but she don't have my heart beating in double time<end_line>
You just shut it down, girl<end_line>
Who told the cops where the party was?<end_line>
Why do I feel like I found The One?<end_line>
What's in these shots that you ordered us?<end_line>
Damn! I mean you sure know how to paint a town<end_line>
Ever since you came around it's obvious you shut it down<end_line>
You shut that shit down<end_line>
You shut it down<end_line>
You shut it down<end_line>
You shut it down<end_line>
You shut it down<end_line>
You shut it, ohh<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
The way I'm feelin', things I say<end_line>
All just happen, when you pass my way<end_line>
What can I do, to make you stay<end_line>
I know its gettin' late, but girl I don't want you to leave...<end_line>
You tell me your just not the type, you wanna do this right<end_line>
But I'm not tryin' to say I don't believe you<end_line>
But I refuse to feel ashamed, and if you feel the same,<end_line>
Just wait here, really make us better people,<end_line>
Take those fuckin' heels off its worth it girl<end_line>
Nothing is what I can picture you in<end_line>
So take that fuckin' dress off<end_line>
I swear you won't forget me, you'll be happy that you let me<end_line>
Lay you down...down...down, tryin' to lay you down...down...down<end_line>
You still the baddest girl around...'round...'round<end_line>
They notice, they notice,<end_line>
Let me lay you down...down...down, tryin' to lay you down...down...down<end_line>
You still the baddest girl around...'round...'round<end_line>
They notice, they notice you would shut it...<end_line>
