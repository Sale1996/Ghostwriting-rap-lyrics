Done saying, I'm done playin', last time was on the outro<end_line>
Stuck in the house, need to get out more, I've been stacking up like I'm fundraising<end_line>
Most people in my position get complacent, come places with star girls<end_line>
End up on them front pages, I'm quiet with it, I just ride with it<end_line>
Moment I stop having fun with it, I'll be done with it<end_line>
I'm the only one that's putting shots up and like a potluck, you need to come with it<end_line>
Don't run from it, like H-Town in the summertime, I keep it 100<end_line>
Met a lot of girls in my times there, word to Paul Wall, not one fronted<end_line>
I was birthed there in my first year, man I know that place like I come from it<end_line>
Backstage at Warehouse in '09 like "Is Bun coming?<end_line>
Fuck that, is anyone coming 'fore I show up there and there's no one there?"<end_line>
These days, I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there<end_line>
Back rub from my main thing, I've been stressed out<end_line>
Talking to her like back then they didn't want me, I'm blessed now<end_line>
Talking to her like this drop, bet a million copies get pressed out<end_line>
She tell me, "Take a deep breath, you're too worried about being the best out"<end_line>

Someone go tell Noel to get the Backwoods<end_line>
Money got my whole family going backwards<end_line>
No dinners, no holidays, no nothing<end_line>
There's issues at hand that we're not discussing<end_line>
Uh, I did not sign up for this<end_line>
My uncle used to have all these things on his bucket list<end_line>
And now he's acting like, "Oh, well, this is life, I guess," Nah, fuck that shit<end_line>
Listen man, you can still do what you wanna do, you gotta trust that shit<end_line>
Heard once that in dire times when you need a sign, that's when they appear<end_line>
Guess since my text message didn't resonate, I'll just say it here<end_line>
Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment, telling herself that she's too sick <end_line>
to get dressed up and go do shit, like that's true shit<end_line>
All my family from the M-Town that I've been 'round, started treating me like I'm "him" now<end_line>
Like we don't know each other, we ain't grow together, we just friends now<end_line>
Shit got me feeling pinned down, pick the pen up or put the pen down<end_line>
Writing to you from a distance like a pen pal, but we've been down, damn<end_line>
