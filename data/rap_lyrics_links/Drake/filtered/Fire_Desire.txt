Dedicate, I dedicate the world<end_line>
Yeah, oh<end_line>
I dedicate, I dedicate<end_line>
I give you my fortune<end_line>
I dedicate, I dedicate<end_line>
I dedicate, I dedicate<end_line>
I dedicate, dedicate, dedicate<end_line>

<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Throwin' dirt on my old name<end_line>
Only gets worse when you know things<end_line>
You don't see the perks of this whole thing<end_line>
But you get real on a pill and I like it<end_line>
You just like my psychic, I just wanna buy<end_line>
Fulfill all your desires<end_line>
Keep you in the front, never in the back<end_line>
And never on the side, yeah<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Look, you know I'm a writer, nothin' left to hide<end_line>
Your other nigga tired<end_line>
Talk about you like you'll never leave his side<end_line>
But I don't really buy it<end_line>
Me I'm movin' quiet, all the things we're tryin'<end_line>
Let's just keep it private<end_line>
Tell me should I cut these other girls right out of my life?<end_line>
Cause we never decided<end_line>
Tell me how you feel inside<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I figure out you, you figure out me<end_line>
We both a different breed<end_line>
I'm followin' your lead, I ask you what you need<end_line>
You say it's guaranteed<end_line>
I mean you say that like it's easy<end_line>
You never believe me<end_line>
Told you I got Zs for these other girls sleepin' on him<end_line>
Girl I'm sleepy<end_line>
Sometimes I'm so indecisive<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I give you my all<end_line>
I dedicate, I dedicate, woah yeah<end_line>
I dedicate, I dedicate<end_line>
I dedicate, baby, dedicate<end_line>
I dedicate to you<end_line>
I dedicate, I dedicate<end_line>
This song's for you<end_line>
I dedicate, I dedicate<end_line>
I give you my all<end_line>
I give you my voice<end_line>
This song's for you<end_line>
<verse_end>
