Ever since I left the city you<end_line>
Got a reputation for yourself now<end_line>
Everybody knows and I feel left out<end_line>
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out<end_line>
Cause ever since I left the city, you<end_line>
Started wearing less and goin' out more<end_line>
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor<end_line>
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before<end_line>

You and me we just don't get along<end_line>
You make me feel like I did you wrong<end_line>
Going places where you don't belong<end_line>
Ever since I left the city, you<end_line>
You got exactly what you asked for<end_line>
Running out of pages on your passport<end_line>
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before<end_line>

These days, all I do is<end_line>
Wonder if you bendin' over backwards for someone else<end_line>
Wonder if your rollin' backwoods for someone else<end_line>
Doing things I taught you gettin' nasty for someone else<end_line>
You don't need no one else<end_line>
You don't need nobody else, no<end_line>
Why you never alone<end_line>
Why you always touching road<end_line>
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl<end_line>
You was in the zone<end_line>
You should just be yourself<end_line>
Right now, you're someone else<end_line>
