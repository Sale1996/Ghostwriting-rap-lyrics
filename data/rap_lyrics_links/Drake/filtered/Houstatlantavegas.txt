Hey there, pretty girl<end_line>
You know, exactly what you got <end_line>
and I don't, blame you at all<end_line>
You can't resist it<end_line>
Especially when the lights so bright <end_line>
and the money so right<end_line>
And it's comin in every single night<end_line>
She don't wanna leaveee-eee-eee-eeE-EEE-EEE-EEE<end_line>
She just stuck in...<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
She doesn't ever worry <end_line>
If she wants it, she'll get it on her own<end_line>
She knows, there's more to life <end_line>
and she's scared, of ending up alone<end_line>
Throw your ones up in the air...<end_line>
Throw your ones up in the air for her...<end_line>
Throw your ones up in the air... <end_line>
'cause the ones you throw will get her out of..<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
We all got dreams and we all star reachin <end_line>
All start peakin, all-star weekend<end_line>
One hotel room, and all y'all sleepin <end_line>
Housekeeping knock to see if all y'all decent<end_line>
Young girls envy the life y'all leadin <end_line>
Never satisfied wit a nice calm evening<end_line>
You be at the games lookin right, all season<end_line>
Butchu always with me, on the night y'all leavin<end_line>
Ass low, ass low, I always request you<end_line>
You go get fucked up and we just show up at your rescue<end_line>
Carry you inside, get you some water and undress you<end_line>
I give you my all and the next morning you'll forget who...<end_line>
...or why, or how, or when<end_line>
Tonight is prol'ly 'bout to happen all over again<end_line>
And she live in a mindset that I could never move to<end_line>
Until you find yourself, it's impossible to lose you<end_line>
Uh... because I never had you...<end_line>
Although I would be glad to...<end_line>
I probably go and tattoo... <end_line>
yo' name on my heart <end_line>
I swear, I start, to think, that I'm going crazy...<end_line>
<verse_end>
