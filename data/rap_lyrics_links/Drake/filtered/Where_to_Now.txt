<verse_start>
It was worth it <end_line>
It was all worth it<end_line>
And by this time I understand that I ain't perfect<end_line>
There ain't a pair of Louis shoes I ain't purchased<end_line>
And I was on some shit but they served they purpose<end_line>
And I got verses <end_line>

My 16s should be arriving in hearses<end_line>
They get bodied, you see how I murk this<end_line>
I switch flows much as my girl switch purses<end_line>
Yeah heartbreak Drake I'll put it on your wife<end_line>
If I put it in a verse then I put it on my life<end_line>
Liquor that's over ice and denim that's overpriced<end_line>
And tryna make all my goals for the future come overnight<end_line>
Got got got got damn how time soars<end_line>
I'm tryna get that house in Toronto with pine floors<end_line>
Come over watch a season of Flight of the Concords<end_line>
And I try to put some lotion all over your contours<end_line>
But uh, tell me you surfin' let me know you on board<end_line>
You can't seal up the bottle once all of the Dom's poured<end_line>
Yes I swear to God girl I put it on Lord<end_line>
I'm tryna show you life through the tint on these Tom Ford's<end_line>
Ethiopian girl Ethiopian girl <end_line>
With yo' long curly hair and yo' big ass bootay<end_line>
Reading all them pro black pro female books<end_line>
Just let 'em let 'em know that you ain't no groupie<end_line>
You need a prescription a vision correction<end_line>
I'm young and successful<end_line>
I'm living perfection<end_line>
And mayne if '09 is when I'mma see mine<end_line>
Being cool ain't enough homie I'mma freeze time <end_line>
Like that<end_line>
