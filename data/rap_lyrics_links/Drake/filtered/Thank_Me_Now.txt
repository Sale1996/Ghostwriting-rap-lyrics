Mahalo from the hardest act to follow<end_line>
Lately I've been drinkin like there's a message in a bottle<end_line>
Aloha's to women with no ties<end_line>
to men that I know well, that way there are no lies<end_line>
You could thank me now for all the info, I give to you niggaz<end_line>
I'm on the brink of influential, I'm here for you niggaz<end_line>
I guess a hit doesn't add up to a career for you niggaz<end_line>
I must've been hard to watch, what a year for you niggaz<end_line>
It's December 31st and we in Miami just meditatin<end_line>
You got your resolutions, we just got reservations<end_line>
Livin out a dream, it feels like I stayed up<end_line>
And we just wanna party, Pat-ron straight up<end_line>
Fuck that old shit, I'm on new things<end_line>
O.V.O. clique, Red Wing boot gang<end_line>
Yeah, we want it all, half was never the agreement<end_line>
Who'da thought the route we chosen would ever end up this scenic?<end_line>
I could relate to kids goin straight to the league<end_line>
When they recognize that you got what it takes to succeed<end_line>
And that's around the time that your idols become your rivals<end_line>
You make friends with Mike but gotta A.I. him for your survival<end_line>
Damn, I swear sports and music are so synonymous<end_line>
Cause we wanna be them, and they wanna be us<end_line>
Yeah, so on behalf of the demanded<end_line>
And the entertainment that you take for granted<end_line>
Y-you, could thank me now, and oh my goodness you're welcome<end_line>
You're welcome; at this point me is who I am tryin to save myself from<end_line>
Rappers hit me up and I never know what to tell them<end_line>
Cause they think that I can help them, get back to where they fell from<end_line>
But drink up, cause everyone here is good tonight<end_line>
Except the niggaz that I came with, they good for life<end_line>
Yeah, that's how you know it's goin down<end_line>
In case another chance never comes around<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Uhh, shallow nigga but deep enough to have gone swimmin<end_line>
I think I'm spendin all my time with the wrong women<end_line>
I think I have a chance at love and knowin me I miss it<end_line>
Cause me dedicatin my time just isn't realistic<end_line>
Man, the good girls went silent on me<end_line>
They got a boyfriend, or left for college on me<end_line>
And all the bad ones I used to hit are friends now<end_line>
That make me wish I had a little less mileage on me<end_line>
But do I ever come up in discussion<end_line>
over double-pump lattes and low-fat muffins?<end_line>
Do I? Or is missin what we had out of the question?<end_line>
I'm probably just the reason that you learned your lesson<end_line>
I got flows for the Marilyn Monroes<end_line>
who was there before it all, I guess that's how it goes<end_line>
They hear about your cons, but focus on your pros<end_line>
And love you for who you are from the bottom of they soul<end_line>
But those same ones from your area will grow<end_line>
into women that are ready to get married at hello<end_line>
because of what they allow, where are they all now?<end_line>
I know they're somewhere watchin so I'm tryin to make 'em proud<end_line>
Searchin for the meanin, you'll find it next to me<end_line>
They tell me I'm the hottest, guess we finally get to see<end_line>
I'm feelin like Nas, who am I to disagree?<end_line>
They say the doors'll open up soon as you find the missin key<end_line>
It's probably why I'm in this bitch shinin<end_line>
Jump up in the sky and put the stars into alignment<end_line>
I rep the ATF in case you need to be reminded<end_line>
And the bandwagon's full but you can try and run behind it<end_line>
I'm sorry; poolside drinkin, margarita rounds<end_line>
Shoutout to my city though, I hardly be in town<end_line>
I'm the +Black Sheep+ but Chris Farley wears the crown<end_line>
And I know life is just a game in which the cards are facin down<end_line>
I'm in a world where things are taken, never given<end_line>
How long they choose to love you will never be your decision<end_line>
And I'm aware that this could be the last time you listen<end_line>
So while I'm still here in this position<end_line>
