<verse_start>
Yeah, mm-hmm, man<end_line>
It's like oh-nine in yo' basement and I'm in love with Nebby<end_line>
And I still love her but it fell through because I wasn't ready<end_line>
And your back hurt, and your neck hurt, and you smokin heavy<end_line>
And I sit next to you, and I lecture you because those are deadly<end_line>
And then you ask shit and we argue about spendin money on bullshit<end_line>
And you tell me I'm just like my father, my one button you push it<end_line>
Now it's "Fuck you, I hate you, I'll move out in a heartbeat"<end_line>
And I leave out and you call me, you tell me that you sorry<end_line>
You love me, and I love you, and yo' heart hurts, mine does too<end_line>
And it's just words and they cut deep but it's our world, it's just us two<end_line>
I see painkillers on the kitchen counter, I hate to see it all hurt so bad<end_line>
But maybe I wouldn't have worked this hard<end_line>
if you were healthy and it weren't so bad<end_line>
Uh, maybe I should walk up the street, and try and get a job at the bank<end_line>
Cause leave it up to me, J, and Neeks, we're probably gonna end up robbin a bank<end_line>
Then Wayne calls on my phone, conversation wasn't that long<end_line>
Gets me a flight to Houston in the mornin<end_line>
Oh it's my time, yeah, it's on<end_line>
He's thinking of signin me, I come home, we make a mixtape with seventeen songs<end_line>
and almost get a Grammy off of that thing, they love your son man that boy gone<end_line>
You get the operation you dreamed of and I finally send you to Rome<end_line>
I get to make good on my promise it all worked out girl, we shoulda known<end_line>
cause you deserve it<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
It's like oh-six in your backyard and I'm in love with Jade<end_line>
And I'm still in love, just wasn't that real, so then it doesn't fade<end_line>
And my father livin in Memphis now he can't come this way<end_line>
Over some minor charges and child support that just wasn't paid<end_line>
Boo-hoo, sad story, black American dad story<end_line>
Know that I'm your sister's kid but<end_line>
That still don't explain the love that you have for me<end_line>
I remember sneakin in your pool after school dances<end_line>
Damn your house feel like the Hamptons, for all of my summer romances<end_line>
I never really had no one like you man this all new shit<end_line>
Made the world I knew bigger, changed the way that I viewed it<end_line>
Had all this fighting going on at the crib you'd calm me down when I lose it<end_line>
Told you I think I'm done actin I'm more in touch with the music<end_line>
You said either way I'll be a star, I could go so far<end_line>
Talked to me, to you got to me you you tossed the keys and loaned me your car<end_line>
Yeah, just a young kid in a drop top Lexus hopin that I don't get arrested<end_line>
Just another kid goin through life so worried that I won't be accepted<end_line>
But I could do anything, you said that, and you meant that<end_line>
You took me places, you spent that, they said no, we went back<end_line>
Checks bounce but we bounce back, I put all the money in your accounts back<end_line>
And I thank you, I don't know how I'd really be without that<end_line>
It worked out man, you deserve it<end_line>
