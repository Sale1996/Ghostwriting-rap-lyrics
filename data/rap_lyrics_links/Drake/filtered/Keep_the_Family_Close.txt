All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore<end_line>
How do you not check on me when things go wrong<end_line>
Guess I should've tried to keep my family closer<end_line>
Much closer<end_line>
All of my "let's just be friends" are friends I don't have anymore<end_line>
Guess that's what they say you need family for<end_line>
Cause I can't depend on you anymore<end_line>

Always saw you for what you could've been<end_line>
Ever since you met me<end_line>
Like when Chrysler made that one car that looked just like the Bentley<end_line>
I always saw you for what you could've been<end_line>
And even when it's business with you it's personal again<end_line>
I knew you before you made ends meet now we're meeting our ends<end_line>
<verse_end>

You're so predictable I hate people like you<end_line>
Kennedy Road taught me not to trust people like you<end_line>
How you supposed to figure what I'm going through<end_line>
You can't even figure out what's going on with you<end_line>
You judge 'fore you met me yeah it figures<end_line>
I make all the player's anthems for the real niggas<end_line>
With my dad out in Tennessee is where I belong<end_line>
Out here in L.A. I don't know what's going on<end_line>
I don't know what's going on<end_line>

<verse_start>
You sit and you pray hoping that the stars align<end_line>
My luck is a sure thing cause I'm living right<end_line>
When I needed you, you couldn't give me any advice<end_line>
But you always had something to say every other time<end_line>
Everybody that I met on the way tries to get in the way<end_line>
I'm fooding and serving them all like I'm working for minimum wage<end_line>
Someone up there must just love testing my patience<end_line>
Someone up there must be in need of some entertainment<end_line>
Forgiveness for your ways<end_line>
If I ever loved ya, I'll always love ya that's how I was raised<end_line>
Same way I'm right here still feeling the wave<end_line>
Same way I'm realizing on a day to day<end_line>
