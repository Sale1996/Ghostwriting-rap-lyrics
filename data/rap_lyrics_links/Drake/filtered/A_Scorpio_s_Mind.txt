<verse_start>
I've been hated by many, wanted by plenty<end_line>
Disliked by some, but confronted by none<end_line>
Since they don't show me sincerity, I load up, lock up<end_line>
Take shots at em I guess you could call it a parody<end_line>
But compared to D<end_line>
They one-fourth from watermelon to a quarter felon, dude you a pear to me<end_line>
If that's not how it is it ain't how it appear to be<end_line>
You got blind heaters, in my sweats is a mind reader<end_line>
And when the psychic get to touching my palm<end_line>
Seein your physical, the things that you never say to me visible<end_line>
Especially when one of your artist feeling threatened<end_line>
Cause I'm harnessing a weapon, won't you pardon my reflection<end_line>
Mirror, mirror tell me why they wanna get and scrimmage<end_line>
To play around, to perfection I'm the spitting image<end_line>
My verbal camp is vivid, I told you I'm spitting image<end_line>
It seems we often want to start but never get to finish<end_line>
My verbal campus is Villanova, and those of you feelin Hova<end_line>
And writing college rhymes, but the thrill is over<end_line>
Let me assist you like a specialist<end_line>
So you can pull it back and try catch the metaphors and the rest of this<end_line>
It's not a problem wit X, I guess I'm a pessimist<end_line>
Which means if shit goes bad I say, "I expected this"<end_line>
And me and Julien we never got the chance to communicate<end_line>
Instead of understanding its a tune of hate<end_line>
The city's mine like Oklahoma's a Sooner state<end_line>
And we're gonna have to cross paths whether soon or late<end_line>
So, why don't you walk up in the spot using less strut<end_line>
You aint Morris Chestnut, you lighter and less cut<end_line>
And lets be honest, by now you should be your own scholar<end_line>
You still a protege, that's the reason I don't holler<end_line>
You got rappers being repetitive actors<end_line>
You stay ahead of the game, I'm ahead of the practice boy<end_line>
