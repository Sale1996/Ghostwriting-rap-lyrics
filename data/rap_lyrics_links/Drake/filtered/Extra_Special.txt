<verse_start>
Look I ought to be thankful because for women I have plentyof love<end_line>
And when it comes to relationships, many is stuck<end_line>
Look at 50 you make love, 30 you have sex<end_line>
Somewhere around the tender age of 20 you fuck<end_line>
Or maybe before, I'm here waiting to score<end_line>
It's long gone like brother's having a tape in their car<end_line>
Instead these girls taking it raw,<end_line>
Now they tell you to do whatever you want because it's safeto explore<end_line>
Forget, wait till it's right now, wait till it's more <end_line>
Wait till he get gets a deal girl, wait till the tour<end_line>
So they dance to attract me, advance and attack me<end_line>
To the point that Drake compare me to Anthony Mackie<end_line>
But once they have my pants and my khakis<end_line>
I tell them I'm not one for commitment and romancing exactly<end_line>
Because, I hate waking up undressed with a dame<end_line>
And guessing her name, I hope this shit is destined tochange<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
I don't get it, it's like my fairy was sick<end_line>
It's like I meet the perfect girl, and she put me throughsome various shit<end_line>
It's something that I can rarely predict<end_line>
All I know is that I can never find the love that TylerPerry depict<end_line>
I'm guessing maybe Shemar Moore isn't really all pure<end_line>
Maybe I lie to myself and it's like a small cure<end_line>
I tell it all to her<end_line>
I gotta feeling this feeling inside is something it's likeand can't be all sure<end_line>
Because really, What is a window without a car door?<end_line>
Why I can't settle for one instead of all four?<end_line>
Mu mind is clouded, this shit complex here<end_line>
Jason tell me I'ma have a baby by next year<end_line>
Psychic told me I'ma have three kids<end_line>
I don't want my daughter making a song like Teairra Mari did<end_line>
So, I'ma change yeah this summer is gone<end_line>
I'm running along, before I raise one of my own<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
Yeah because you special baby<end_line>
Yeah this the remix right here<end_line>
Yeah Trendsetters<end_line>
Drake, It's Southern Smoke<end_line>
<verse_end>
