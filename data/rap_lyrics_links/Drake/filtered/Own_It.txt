You're still the one that I adore<end_line>
Ain't much out there to have feelings for<end_line>
Guess who's it is? Guess who's it is?<end_line>
Guess who's it is? Guess who's it is?<end_line>
A few bottles on the table, a few waters<end_line>
It ain't a secret, baby, everybody saw us<end_line>
Guess who's it is? Guess who's it is?<end_line>
Guess who's it is?<end_line>
It's yours<end_line>

Next time we fuck, I don't want to fuck, I want to make love<end_line>
Next time we talk, I don't want to just talk, I want to trust<end_line>
Next time I stand tall I want to be standing for you<end_line>
And next time I spend I want it all to be with you<end_line>
Peaking, I'm peaking, wake up with me this weekend, weekend<end_line>
Guess who's it is?<end_line>
Guess who's it is? Guess who's it is?<end_line>
It's yours<end_line>

Niggas talk more than bitches these days<end_line>
Just let that shit sink in<end_line>
Niggas talk more than bitches these days<end_line>
Who could get the pussy quicker these days<end_line>
Still straight with the weed and the liquor these days<end_line>
Cause the new drugs got the kids trippin' these days<end_line>
Bunch of journalists been searchin' for a story<end_line>
My ex-girl been searchin' for a "sorry"<end_line>
Couple bitches tryin' to have me on the Maury like nigga it's yours<end_line>
You should be supportin' but where you been at? On tour, gettin' money<end_line>
Y'all don't even really check for me<end_line>
You ain't even hit me when that nigga had threats for me<end_line>
Girl, you don't love me, you just say that shit to get to me<end_line>
Girl, cause you got the Batphone in my workline<end_line>
You should call it<end_line>
When the last time you did something for the first time?<end_line>
You have done it all, swear to God<end_line>
Niggas talk more than bitches these days<end_line>
Got you thinkin' I'm different these days<end_line>
Broken telephone for every single conversation<end_line>
By the time it gets to you, shit switches these days<end_line>
It's yours, it's your, it's yours, it's always gonna be yours<end_line>
