<verse_start>
Why do I feel so alone<end_line>
Like everybody passin' through the studio<end_line>
Is in character as if he actin' out a movie role<end_line>
Talkin' bullshit as if it was for you to know<end_line>
And I don't have the heart to give these bitch niggas the cue to go<end_line>
So they stick around kickin' out feedback<end_line>
And I entertain it as if I need that<end_line>
I had a talk with my uncle and he agreed that<end_line>
My privacy is about the only thing I need back<end_line>
But, it's hard to think of them polite flows<end_line>
When Stefano Polatto suits are your night clothes<end_line>
And Jordan sweat suits are your flight clothes<end_line>
And you still make it even when they say your flight's closed<end_line>
Eyes hurtin' from the camera phone light shows<end_line>
Life was so full now the shit just bein lypo'd<end_line>
Always said I'd say it all on the right track<end_line>
But in this game you only lose when you fight back<end_line>
Black diamond bracelets, showin' you the basics<end_line>
I can't live and hold the camera, someone gotta tape this<end_line>
I make hits and like a bitch that's married I ain't Miss<end_line>
24 hours from greatness; I'm that close<end_line>
Don't ever forget the moment you began to doubt<end_line>
Transitioning from fittin' in to standin' out<end_line>
Los Angeles cabanas or Atlanta South<end_line>
Watchin' Hov's show embarrassed to pull my camera out<end_line>
And my mother's embarrassed to pull my Phantom out<end_line>
So I park about five houses down<end_line>
She say I shouldn't have it until I have the crown<end_line>
But I don't want to feel a need to wear disguises around<end_line>
So she wonder where my mind is, account's in the minus<end_line>
But yet I roll around the fuckin' city like your highness<end_line>
Got niggas reactin' without a sinus<end_line>
'Cause what I'm workin' with is timeless<end_line>
And promoters try to get me out to their clubs<end_line>
And say I had fun but I can't imagine how<end_line>
Cuz I just seen my ex girl standin' wit my next girl<end_line>
Standin' with the girl that I'm fuckin' right now<end_line>
And shit could get weird, unless they're all down<end_line>
And so I stay clear, we're from a small town<end_line>
And everybody talks, and everybody listens<end_line>
But somehow the truth just always comes up missing<end_line>
Of always being somethin' that these labels can't buy<end_line>
Especially if they tryin' to take a piece of my soul<end_line>
And Sylvia be tellin' Taz, "Damn, Drake fly!"<end_line>
And he just be like, "Silly motherfucker I know!"<end_line>
That was your bad, how could you pass up on him?<end_line>
He just take them records and he gas up on them<end_line>
Wayne would probably put a million cash up on him<end_line>
Surprised no one ever put yo ass up on him<end_line>
Oh they did po, at least they tried to<end_line>
And that's what happens when you spittin what's inside you<end_line>
But slip up and shoot the wrong fuckin' video<end_line>
And they think they can market you however they decide to<end_line>
Nah, but 40 told me to do me<end_line>
And don't listen to anybody that knew me<end_line>
'Cause to have known me would mean that there's a new me<end_line>
And if you think I changed in the slightest, could have fooled me<end_line>
Boy, and to my city I'm the 2-3<end_line>
Drug dealers live vicariously through me<end_line>
I quit school and it's not because I'm lazy<end_line>
I'm just not the social type and campus life is crazy<end_line>
Understand, I can get money with my eyes closed<end_line>
Lost some of my hottest verses down in Cabo<end_line>
So if you find a Blackberry with the side scroll<end_line>
Sell that motherfucker to any rapper that I know<end_line>
'Cause they need it much more than I ever will<end_line>
I got new shit; I'm gettin' better still<end_line>
Little niggas put my name in their verses<end_line>
Cuz their girlfriend put my ass on a pedestal<end_line>
Future said 'cause this 'Ye shit you better kill<end_line>
And I think this got that making-of-a-legend feel<end_line>
Problem with these other niggas they aint never real<end_line>
Yea....that's all I can say<end_line>
<verse_end>
