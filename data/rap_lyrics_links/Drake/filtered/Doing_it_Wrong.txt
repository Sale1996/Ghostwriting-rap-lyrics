When a good thing goes bad it's not the end of the world<end_line>
It's just the end of a world that you had with one girl and<end_line>
She's the reason it happened, but she's overreacting<end_line>
And it's all because she don't want things to change<end_line>
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you<end_line>
That's the wrong thing to do...<end_line>
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you<end_line>
That's the wrong thing to do...<end_line>
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you<end_line>
That's the wrong thing to do...<end_line>
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying<end_line>
And say, "I love you, too"<end_line>
<verse_end>

<verse_start>
We live in a generation of not being in love <end_line>
and not being together..<end_line>
But we sure make it feel like we're together..<end_line>
Because we're scared to see each other with somebody else<end_line>
So cry if you need to, but I can't stay to watch you<end_line>
That's the wrong thing to do...<end_line>
Touch if you need to, but I can't stay to hold you<end_line>
That's the wrong thing to do, whoa<end_line>
Talk if you need to, but I can't stay to hear you<end_line>
That's the wrong thing to do...<end_line>
Cause you'll say you love me, and I'll end up lying<end_line>
And say, "I love you, too"<end_line>
