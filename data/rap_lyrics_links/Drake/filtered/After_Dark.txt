<verse_start>
Late night, like Left Eye, I'm +Creepin+<end_line>
Assumin the worst cause I haven't, heard from you, all weekend<end_line>
Your silence is drivin me up the wall, up the wall<end_line>
I cannot tell if you're ducking calls, or missing calls<end_line>
Cause, you've been so patient<end_line>
I drink on the job and, smoke on the job<end_line>
So, I don't know how serious you take it<end_line>
Can't offer much more, you've heard it before<end_line>
That narrative for me isn't changin<end_line>
I wanna make you a priority<end_line>
I wanna let you know there's more to me<end_line>
I wanna have your faith restored in me<end_line>
I'll be on my way<end_line>
<verse_end>
