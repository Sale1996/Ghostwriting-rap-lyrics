[Drake]
She says "Kiss me like you miss me, fuck me like you hate me
And when you're fuckin someone else just fuck her like she ain't me"
Damn, those words are scary, those words are scary Virgin Mary
I just tell her to spare me - I was in love two years ago
and gave the baggage to my ex, that's all for her to carry
Bags she deserved to carry - I hate that hoe
I made it so hard just to talk, don't I? I get off topic, don't I?
I get it poppin, don't I? I'll end up stoppin, won't I?
And by the time I end up stoppin you'll be rockin one of the rings 
that you pointed out while shoppin with a nigga, don't lie
Uh, she's losin it right now
Cause if I wasn't who I am she woulda been movin in by now
But instead we're movin slow, I guess she's used to it by now
And she gives me all her trust and I'm abusin it right now
With this money comin in it's just confusin shit right now
You just told me I ain't shit, I guess I'm provin it right now

[Chorus: Drake]
I said I rather be with you, but you are not around
So I'ma call somebody up and see if they be down
Cause I hate sleepin alone, I hate sleepin alone...
Half the time we don't end up fuckin, I don't ask her for nothin
You leave me in the mornin, I don't see her for months
But I just hate sleepin alone, I hate sleepin alone 
So she's here and we're both so gone

[Drake]
Hotel to hotel, girl I could use yo' company
Full name and birthday, I'll book a flight and you come to me
But don't want a weekend, she wants all of me and none of me
If she can't work with all of me then she says she's done with me
You say that you're over me, you always end up under me
You know how it goes, don't be crazy, don't play dumb with me
Don't start with yo' shit, I'll put you back in yo' place
She tells me "I bet you won't, you won't say that to my face"
And hangs up, yeah; how dare you tell me it's tougher for you?
Like I don't hear about the niggaz you fuckin with too
And whoever I be with they got nothin on you
That's just somethin to do when there's nothin to do
Yeah, but she's losin it right now
She has choices she should make, I think she's choosin it right now
One more chance to make it right I think I'm usin it right now
You just said I'd never learn, I guess I'm provin it right now

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Ohhhh, she's here, but so gone
Ohhhhhh... oh-ohhhhh
