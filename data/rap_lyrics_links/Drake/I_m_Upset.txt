[Intro]
Yeah
{"I'm workin on dyin"}

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm upset
Fifty thousand on my head is disrespect
So offended that I had to double check
I'ma always take the money over sex
That's why they need me out the way, what you expect?

[Drake]
Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go 50/50 with no hoe
... Every month
I'm supposed to pay her bills and get her what she want
I still got like seven years of doin what I want
My dad still got child support from 1991
... Outta town
People love to pop a lot of shit then come around
Word to Flacko Jodye, he done seen us put it down
Niggaz askin if I'm cool

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm upset
Hun'ned thousand on my head is disrespect
So offended that I had to double check
... You tryna check?
This is real life, niggaz think we playin chess

[Drake]
So what's next?
Jump up out the bed like I'm possessed
I go out on tour and I say I'm drinkin less
End up gettin loose and gettin pictures from my ex
... SMS, triple X
That's the only time I ever shoot below the neck (skrrt)
Why you keep on shootin if you know that nigga dead? (skrrt)
That's the only kind of shit that gets you some respect
Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul (for my soul)
Thankful for the women that I know
Can't go 50/50 with no hoe (ayy, ayy)
... Every month
She don't even love me, she just puttin on a front (front)
She gon' try and settle outta court and make a run
Then gon' ask me how I'm doin?

[Chorus: Drake]
I'm upset
Half a million on my head I can accept, yeah
Least it make me feel like someone tried they best, yeah
Wanna waste a half a million, be my guest
Make me wanna buy a vest and a TEC (skrrt)

[Drake]
But I'm blessed, I just checked
Hate me, never met me in the flesh
Say she got some things she gotta come here and collect
That shit is in a box to the left, to the left
Got a lot of blood and it's cold
They keep tryna get me for my soul (for my soul!)
Thankful for the women that I know (that I know)
Can't go 50/50 with no hoe
