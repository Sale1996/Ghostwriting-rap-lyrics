[Intro: Chantal Kreviazuk]
How I'm feeling, it doesn't matter
Cause you know I'm okay
Instead, I ask myself "Why do you hurt me?"
When you know, you know I'm the same
I know, I know that you love me baby
Time to take you away from me
Only, over my dead bo-ohh-ohhhdy

[Drake]
... I think I killed e'rybody
in the game last year man fuck it I was on though
And I thought I found the girl of my dreams
at the strip club, mm-mmm, fuck it I was wrong though
Shout out all to all my niggaz livin tax free
Now-a-days it's six figures when they tax me
Oh well~! I guess you lose some and win some
Long as the outcome is income
You know I want it all, and then some
Shout out to Asian girls, let the lights dim sum
Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
Probably some bad hoes about to take the hemp from
Yeah, you know me well nigga
I mean you ain't the only real nigga
They got me on these white women like Seal nigga
Slave to the pussy but I'm just playin the field nigga
Yeah, are these people discussin my career again?
Askin if I'll be goin platinum in a year again?
Don't I got the shit the world wanna hear again?
Don't Michael Jordan still got his hoop earring in?
Man all of your flows bore me: paint dryin
And I don't ever be trippin off of what ain't mine
And I be hearin shit you say through the grapevine
But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
Yeah, it's been that way from the beginnin
I just been playin, I ain't even notice I was winnin
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright

[Chorus: Chantal Kreviazuk]
I know, I know that you love me baby
The time to take you away from me
Only, over my dead bo-ohh-ohhhdy

[Drake]
You say I'm old news, where who the new star?
Cause if I'm going anywhere it's probably too far
Just performed at a bar mitzvah over in the states
Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
Red wine over Fed time
And shout out to the niggaz that's doing dead time
And shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
And fuck you to the niggaz that think it's their time
Yeah, don't make me take your life apart boy
You and whoever the fuck gave you a start boy
Or you wanna be a muh'fuckin funny guy?
Don't make me break your Kevin heart boy
Yeah, it's whatever
You know, feeling good, livin better
I think maybe I was numb to it last year
But you know I feel it now more than ever
My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay
Second album, I'm back pavin the way
The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
like this was my "Comeback Season" back, back in the day
And I met your baby moms last night
We took a picture together - I hope she frames it
And I was drinking at the Palms last night
And ended up losin everything that I came with
Yeah, feel like I've been here befo' huh?
I still got ten years to go huh?
And this is the only sound you should fear
Man, these kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright

[Chorus]
