[Drake]
These girls ain't got nothing on you
Uhh, say baby I had to mention
That if you were a star you'd be the one I'm searching for
All the girls they got attention
But I just always feel like there in need of something you got
It's obvious you're pretty
Heard that your a student working weekends in the city
Trying to take you out girl, hope your not too busy
And if there's nothing wrong, got this little song
for you to get ready to
Put those fucking heels on and work it girl
Let that mirror show you what your doing
Put that fucking dress on and work it kind of vicious
like somebody's taking pictures

[Chorus]
Shut it down down down
You would shut it down down down
You be the baddest girl around round round
And they notice they notice
You would shut it down down down
You be the baddest girl around round round
And they notice they notice
You would shut it, hey oh
These girls ain't got nothing on you
Nothing on you

[The-Dream]
Girl you're the greatest
and if he say you ain't
girl he's out his mind
You're the finest
and if he say you ain't
that boy done lost his mind
Hey baby, everytime you come around
shut it down like computers
Hey lady, step into my heart
and put you in the Louboutins
what you want
What you need
I can be (I can be)
your everything
(who knew)
them other niggas
just wanna hit it but if they had it
wouldn't know what to do with it
(and together)

[Drake & The-Dream]
We shut it down down down
They know we shut it down down down
You're the baddest girl around, round round
They know this, they know this
(repeated)

[The-Dream]
TMZ, Concrete Loop
You shut that motherfucker down down
Ice cream conversations, they all want the scoop
You shut that motherfucker down down down

[Drake]
Shooting Stars all around her, fire, comets
I could bring her through and shut them down, Onyx
No, you're not imagining, they're looking at you long stares
Even though she's standing out she looks like she belongs here
You feel the hours pass, until you find somethin'
I feel like when she moves Â– the time doesn't
Yeah, baby you finer than your fine cousin, and your cousin fine
but she don't have my heart beating in double time
You just shut it down, girl
Who told the cops where the party was?
Why do I feel like I found The One?
What's in these shots that you ordered us?
Damn! I mean you sure know how to paint a town
Ever since you came around it's obvious you shut it down
You shut that shit down (down down down)
You shut it down (down down down)
You shut it down (down down down)
You shut it down (down down down)
You shut it down (down down down)
You shut it, ohh

[Drake]
You know this, you know this

[The-Dream]
You looking good girl
Go go go get em girl
Go go go go hit em girl
Go go go go go go
You shut it down

[Drake]
The way I'm feelin', things I say
All just happen, when you pass my way
What can I do, to make you stay
I know its gettin' late, but girl I don't want you to leave...
You tell me your just not the type, you wanna do this right
But I'm not tryin' to say I don't believe you
But I refuse to feel ashamed, and if you feel the same,
Just wait here, really make us better people,
Take those fuckin' heels off its worth it girl
Nothing is what I can picture you in
So take that fuckin' dress off
I swear you won't forget me, you'll be happy that you let me
Lay you down...down...down, tryin' to lay you down...down...down
You still the baddest girl around...'round...'round
They notice, they notice,
Let me lay you down...down...down, tryin' to lay you down...down...down
You still the baddest girl around...'round...'round
They notice, they notice you would shut it...
