[Intro: Drake]
Trap, TrapMoneyBenny
This shit got me in my feelings
Gotta be real with it, yup

[Chorus: Drake]
Kiki, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always
KB, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always

[Drake]
Look, the new me is really still the real me
I swear you gotta feel me before they try and kill me
They gotta make some choices, they runnin out of options
Cause I've been goin off and they don't know when it's stoppin
And when you get to toppin, I see that you've been learnin
And when you get to shopping, you spend it like you earned it
And when you popped off on your ex, he deserved it
I thought you were the one from the jump, that confirmed it
... TrapMoneyBenny
I buy you champagne but you love some Henny
+From the Block+ like you Jenny
I know you special girl, cause I know too many

[Chorus: Drake]
'Resha, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always
JT, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always

[City Girls]
Two bad bitches and we kissin in the Wraith
Kissin-kissin in the Wraith, kiss-kissin in the Wraith
I need that black card and the code to the safe
Code to the safe, code-code to the safe-safe
I show him how that neck work
Fuck that Netflix and chill, what's your net-net-net worth?

[Drake] + {Magnolia Shorty sample}
Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always

And I'm down for you al-

{"I got a new boy, and that nigga trade!"}

[Chorus: Drake]
Kiki, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
Cause I want ya, and I need ya
And I'm down for you always
KB, do you love me? Are you riding?
Say you'll never ever leave from beside me
Cause I want ya, and I-
