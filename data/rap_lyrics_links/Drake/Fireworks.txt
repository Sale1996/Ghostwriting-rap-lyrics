[Drake]
Money just changed everything, I wonder how life without it would go
From the concrete who knew that a flower would grow?
Lookin down from the top and it's crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant shit
When I hear 'em talkin I just don't know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracin it
Doesn't come natural, bear with me it could take a bit
Yeah, and my dreams are who I'm racin with
But you could see I'm pacin it so that I'm always chasin it
Wayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with
I hope that my success never alters our relationship
Yeah, this life is somethin I would die for
+October's Own+ but it's lookin like July 4
I just wish they'd let you try it first
This time I'm really goin off, fireworks

[Chorus: Drake - singing] + (Alicia Keys)
Today it begins
I've missed them before but, won't miss them again
I keep havin the saaaaaaame dream
And I think that I just realized what it means
(All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks)
(Every night is fireworks, every night is fireworks)
(All I see is fireworks, all I see is fireworks)
(Takin off like fireworks, takin off like ohhhhhhh ohhh)

[Drake]
I'm just such a gentleman, you should give it up for me
Look at how I'm placin all my napkins and my cutlery
I could tell it wasn't love, I just thought you fuck with me
Who coulda predicted Lucky Strike will have you stuck with me
Damn, I kept my wits about me luckily
What happened between us that night, it always seems to trouble me
Now all of a sudden these gossip rags wanna cover me
And you makin it seem like it happened that way because of me
But I was curious
And I'll never forget it baby, what an experience
You coulda been the one but it wasn't that serious
There was smoke in the air before, that was me clearin it
That felt good, all in all I learned a lesson from it though
You never see it comin, you just get to see it go
Yeah, I shoulda looked up in the sky at first
Now I could see it in her eyes, fireworks

[Chorus]

[Drake]
Everything the same but it feels different
My dad called me up knowin that I still listen
And he still got his foot out, guilt trippin
It's been years though, I just learn to deal wit it
For real, me and my Realtor we built up a better rapport
Got my mother in a place with some better decor
She searched the entire city, I let her explore
And now she's sayin she more lonely than ever before
How many of our parents' marriage has lasted?
I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted
I'm flyin back home for the heritage classic
Searchin for that feelin, tell me where is the magic?
Let's stay together 'til we're ghosts
I wanna winess love, I never seen it close
Yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first
That's why I'm really goin off, fireworks

[Chorus]

[Alicia Keys]
Ohhhhh-ohhhh, ohhhhh-ohhhh, ohhhhh-ohhhh, ohhh-ohhh
Ohhhhh-ohhhh, ohhhhh-ohhhh, ohhhhh-ohhhh, ohhh-ohhh
