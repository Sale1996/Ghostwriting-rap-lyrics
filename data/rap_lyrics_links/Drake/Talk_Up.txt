[Intro: Drake]
Ayy, ayy
Lot of 6's in here tonight
Yeah, yeah, ayy
{"Dopeman!"}

[Drake]
Ten of us, we movin as one
I'm so proud of who I've become
You might think I've taken some lumps
... Only if we talkin 'bout sums (yeah)
Intentions are pure, they cannot tell me relax
My mentions are jokes, but they never give me the facts
This isn't that, can't be ignorin the stats
Based off of that, they gotta run me the max
They gotta run me the max, they gotta double the racks
They had it set up for real, but they didn't come with the slaps
When I heard the shit I was skippin through that
... If I get it trippin it's no comin back
I don't understand, these niggaz gotta adapt
You know where I'm at, I put the 6 on the map
Your shorty was bent, she wanted to vent, I promise it fell in my lap
My money is young, my problems are old, I promise I'm bridgin the gap

[Chorus: Drake]
{"Dopeman!"} Woo, you know what I'm sayin?
Woo! {"Dopeman!"} Ayy, ayy {"Dopeman!"}
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin? {"Dopeman!"}
(Geah, geah, geah, geah!) {"Dopeman!"}
Niggaz provoke, this shit ain't a joke, man nobody playin
He's at the top, and he's at the top, but nobody's stayin {"Dopeman!"}
These niggaz around but they ain't around, you know what I'm sayin?
Say that they down when they shit is down, you know what I'm sayin?
{"Dopeman!"} Yeah, you know what I'm sayin?
Ayy, ayy {"Dopeman!"}
Yeah, you know what I'm sayin?
... {"Dopeman!"}

[JAY-Z]
Yo, get close enough to Hov' smell like a kilo still (still)
First album 26, I ain't need no deal (real)
Already a hood legend, I ain't need no shine
First Roley flooded out, I ain't see no time (whoa)
Stand-up niggaz, we only duckin indictments
Dope boys, Off-White, lookin like soft white on 'em
Heh, hehehe, you know what I'm sayin?
We in the building, we came for a billion, ain't nobody playin
Live every word that I'm rappin, say I lost 90 bricks and it happened
You probably wouldn't believe
everything that you seein right now if it wasn't live action
I ain't on the 'gram, they record who I am
God to these dope boys, how do you not be a Hov' fan?
I'm what Meech shoulda been, I'm what Supreme didn't become
If Alpo didn't snitch, niggaz'd be like Young
I got your President tweetin, I won't even meet with him
Y'all killed X, let Zimmerman live, pshh, streets is done

[Chorus]

{"Dopeman!"}
{"Dopeman!"}
{"Dopeman!"}
