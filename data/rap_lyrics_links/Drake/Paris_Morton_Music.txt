[Chorus: Drake - singing]
Would've came back for you, I just needed time
to do what I had to do, caught in the life
I can't let it go, whether that's right
I won't ever know, ohh ohh ohh
Hope you forgive me, never meant wrong
Tried to be patient, and waited too long
But I woulda came back, but I woulda came back for you (uh)
Woulda came back, woulda came back

[Drake]
I talk, slicker, than a pimp from Augusta
who just had his linen suit dry-cleaned, bitches what's up wit'cha?
I hate callin the women bitches but the bitches love it
I took some sense/cents and make a nickel of it
I'm urgin all daughters to kiss they mothers
With those lips that all that lipstick covers
You're never too grown up to miss and hug her
And girls count on me to be there like missin rubbers
I'm on some Marvin Gaye shit, a bunch of +Distant Lovers+
This ain't the life that I'm used to
Reintroduced to people I been introduced to
Did you forget me? Or are you too scared to tell me that you met me
in fear that I won't remember, I wish you could still accept me for me
I miss Memphis, Tennessee, my cousins, my dad
The simplistic beauty that all of them Southerners had
I'm halfway across the world with dozens of bags
Feelin like all four members of Color Me Badd
In one nigga, amazin shit
I got that Courtney Love for ya, that crazy shit
I don't drink every bottle I own, I be agin shit
And I got them wedding ring flows, that engagin shit
Which one of y'all got fleets on your keychains and seats for these Heat games?
I really think that you stare at yourself and you see things
La familia, I been inducted and instructed
to stunt on these niggaz we don't really fuck with - fuck is up?
Havin lunch and debatin Ferrari prices
23 and goin through a mid-life crisis
But trust me I still deliver like a midwife
And no I'm not sayin I'm the nicest, I just live life like it
Uhh, it take a certain type of man to teach
To be far from hood but to understand the streets
I never threw away that paper with my Grammy speech
because I haven't hit the pinnacles I plan to reach
Yeah, you gotta own it if you want it
Kisses all on her body she tells me live in the moment
And baby, I never forget none of that
Girl I told you I was comin back (ah)

[Chorus]
