[Drake - singing]
I can see it in your eyes - you're angry
Regret ain't got shit on what you're feelin now
Mad cause he ain't like me
Oh you mad cause nobody ever did it like me
All the care I would take, all the love that we made
Now you're tryin to find somebody to replace what I gave to you
It's a shame you didn't keep it
Alicia, Katia, I know that you gon' hear this
I'm the man, yeah I said it
Bitch I'm the man~! Don't you forget it
The way you walk, that's me
The way you talk, that's me
The way you've got your hair up - did you forget that's me?
And the voice in your speaker right now - that's me that's me
And the voice in your mirror, that's me
Can't you see that I made it? Yeah I made it
First I made you who you are, and then I made it
And you're wasted, with your ladies
Yeah I'm the reason why you always gettin faded

[Chorus]
Take a shot for me, ho-ooooh {*2X*}
Take a shot for me
A shot for me
A shot for me

[Drake - rapping]
Ok look - I'm honest, girl I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I commit to
I never cheated for the record back when I was with you
But you believe in everything but me girl, I don't get you
She says I know you changed, I never see you
Cause you're always busy doin thangs
I really wish had a different way of viewin thangs
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
It's such a small place not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
And now your friends tellin you stories that you often misinterpret
And taint all your images of yo' "Mr. Perfect"
I could tell that you been cryin all night, drinkin all summer
Prayin for your happiness, hope that you recover
Uhh, this is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it

[Chorus]

[Outro: Drake]
Yeah
May your neighbors respect you, trouble neglect you
Angels protect you, and heaven accept you
