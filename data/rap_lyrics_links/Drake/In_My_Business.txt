[Gucci Mane]
I'm so fuckin dumb I wear diamonds on my thumbs
It's a diamond on my dick so that's a diamond on her tongue
I can't feel you baby cause I'm romantically numb
Emotionally drained, I came here just so I could cum
It's nothin under God's sun that I haven't done
I got a lot of problems, gettin pussy just isn't one
Girls are like buses, every 15 man they run
Nah they're like potato chips, I just cannot have one
And I might like you for a minute
But I don't like yo' friends in my business
And I don't feel like you deserve a visit
Cause you weren't in the kitchen with me water whippin

[Chorus: Drake]
Uhh, uh-uhhhhhhh
I know you say you love me girrrrrrl
I know you say you love me girl
Problem is you probably tell that shit to e'rybody
So we hear you talkin boo but we just don't believe you

[Drake]
Uhh, okay I'm all about it, all for it
I'm all-star team Jordan, small forward
I'm never puttin up a shot unless it calls for it
No hesitation so I'm shootin if I draw for it
Pow pow, fuck is up? No man, I'm in this hoe
Life is movin fast, where the fuck do all these minutes go?
Mixtape dropped then I started gettin ten a show
Now I get a hundred, what the fuck you think I'm in it fo'?
Young Money forever, I bet Gudda, Jae and Mack agree
Fuck you to the haters that just spend they time attackin me
Shoutout to yo' girlfriend nigga, lately she distractin me
Wonderin if I'm the best, +well.I.am+ no Black Eyed Peas
Girls wanna fuck you, niggaz gotta wanna be you
Linin up around the block so they can get to see you
I feel like I'll find a wife exactly when I need to
So you could say whatever girl but we just don't believe you

[Chorus]

[Sean Garrett]
Ain't that your girl? Ain't that your money?
Ain't you the same nigga that said she won't do that? You funny
You a gangsta, yeah funny
You gave him fo', he gave you two, you fuckin dummy
Classic line, bitches run like buses, Gucci said it
Niggaz askin why, "Why you with my girl?" She let me get it
Nigga she ain't stupid, go turn up your radio
I'm the next young Lionel Richie, I gives a FUCK about doin a fuckin cameo
We don't love 'em, we don't love 'em, we don't love 'em, no
They just love us, they just love us cause we stack them O's
Cause we whip IT, watch her whip IT, when she whip IT, all us gon' HIT
Once they mention catchin feelings, two words "I'm gone"

[Chorus]
